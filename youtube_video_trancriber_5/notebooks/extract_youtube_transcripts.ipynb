       "[' This video is sponsored by \"Brilliant\"; more on that later. Hi, I\\'m Griffin Johnson, the Armchair Historian. Today\\'s video: What was life like in Nazi Germany? When one tries to imagine what life was like for the average German between the years of 1933 and 1945, what comes to mind? Many would likely envision it as a drab nightmarish totalitarian dystopia, and in many ways this was true, certainly for the sections of society that the Nazi\\'s firmly repressed, but how much different was life like for the Germans who lived up to Hitler standards? Before we address the life of the average citizen, we must first understand what life was like for minorities, and as can be imagined the rights of these groups were essentially eliminated, almost as soon as Hitler took power in 1933. Jewish civil servants such as teachers, professors, engineers, and administrators were excluded from government employment within the first few months of Hitler\\'s election. The Nazis used their newly acquired power to orchestrate what would be known as \"Kristallnacht\" or \"Crystal Night\" in which thousands of Jewish businesses, homes, and synagogues were burned or otherwise vandalized, their owners beaten and arrested. By 1941 almost all of Germany\\'s remaining Jewish population, which 10 years earlier had numbered over half a million, were imprisoned in concentration camps. The Nazis embarked on an ideologically-fueled campaign against virtually all minorities and marginal groups of society including gypsies, homosexuals, Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, and ethnic Slavs. One of the methods used in this campaign was forced sterilization. In the words of Richard Evans in his book \"The Third Reich in Power\" \"In essence the Nazi regime was using Sterilization to crush those areas of society that did not conform to the Nazi ideal.\" Another particular aspect of this campaign that has been written about repeatedly, is the Nazis eugenics program which sought to systematically breed out those the Nazis deemed \"untermenschen\" or subhuman. For example, state-appointed physicians were authorized and instructed to euthanize children that were considered, by the Nazis, to be unworthy of life. Up to one-hundred thousand Germans including twenty-thousand children were euthanized between 1939 and 1941. Now that we understand the experiences of those the Nazis persecuted, let\\'s examine how life was for everyday citizens. While the role of men in society under the new regime was not much different from that of the previous, one women experienced a variety of new expectations the Nazis introduced what they saw as traditional German values for women, which included modesty, dedication to Christian (in this case Nazified) values, and most importantly the production of children, which the Nazis viewed as a crucial component of their plans to expand the German nation. In fact, a civil award: a German Mother\\'s Cross, was established and given to women who bore at least four children. In schools, students were taught a curriculum that was designed to encourage discrimination and discourage racial mixing. To quote Richard Evans again: \"Teachers and pupils greet each other at the beginning and end of every lesson with the Nazi salute.\" The pupils listen to major political speeches on the radio in the school hall.\" As we mentioned, the primary objective of the Nazi school system was to ensure that the party\\'s ideology became ingrained in the minds of students, something which was intended to produce loyal soldiers for future wars. Dating all the way back from 1922, the Hitler Youth and later on its female branch, the League of German Girls, was meant to prepare boys for military service and girls for motherhood. These organizations were incredibly popular in Germany and by 1939, over 90 percent of Germany\\'s children were part of the Hitler Youth. During this time, even more innocuous institutions of German society began to take a National Socialists slant, as can be seen with the positive Christianity movement, which was a state-sponsored program to unite all of Germany\\'s Protestant churches into one national church that would legitimize and support the Nazi agenda. Government, under the direction of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, distributed millions of inexpensive radios to the people in order to make sure that important political messages could reach them. These measures, however, often did not produce the desired effect, as most people were only interested in carrying on daily life as it had existed before. Recognizing that most of the German people could not be fully indoctrinated, the government enforced its ideal German state through legislation. For example, it was required for both men and women aged 19 to 25 to commit a six-month tour of public labor, in which they fulfilled the Nazi concept of a social labor force. Women were then allowed to return home, but men were conscripted into the Wehrmacht or German military. This provided a steady source of manpower for the ultra-militaristic Nazi state. The Nazis also introduced the \"Volkswagen\" or \"People\\'s car\", which was intended to provide each German  household with a vehicle, as part of Hitler\\'s campaign to motorize Germany. In regards to economics, the Great Depression was taking a disastrous toll on the German people before the Nazis were elected. By 1933, unemployment stood at 35 percent and inflation was rampant. Naturally, the Nazis promised to improve the state of the German economy, something which earned them many votes in the election of 1933. Their first priority was to reduce the dismal amount of unemployment in Germany by initiating large public works projects such as the construction of canals and the \"Autobahn\" or \"Highway\". Hitler boasted his success in spite of the fact that many of the employment statistics that were used excluded significant portions of the population such as Jews and soldiers. Though the Nazis economic reforms have generally been considered effective, it took years for the unemployment rate to actually drop to stable levels. Despite promising peace, both during and after his election, Hitler would once again involve the German people in a large-scale war. As the need for resources to power the German military grew larger and larger, more countries were subjected to Hitler\\'s conquest, something which escalated the war onto a global scale. As the conflict raged on, it quickly became apparent to most observers, even those within Germany, that the idealistic utopia that the Nazis hoped for would never come to fruition. The sheer number of casualties that the war produced, especially on the Eastern Front was overwhelming. When defeat finally did arrive, it would take nearly a half-century before life would return to normal, as the country was divided between the Democratic West and the Communist East, until they were reunited in 1990. One of the scientists who fled Germany in the 1930\\'s was none other than Albert Einstein. Our sponsor for today, \"Brilliant\", allows you to master the kind of problem-solving and logic that would have been familiar to Einstein himself. Jumping into science, math, and physics sounds like an extremely daunting task, especially for an armchair historian like yourself, but \"Brilliant\" allows you to learn these concepts through fun bite-sized problems. In all of \"Brilliant\\'s\" lessons they\\'re both visuals and thorough explanations. If you\\'re currently a student or just a lifelong learner, we highly recommend you start your free trial at \"brilliant.org/armchairhistorian\". The first seventy-six users, the amount of years that Einstein was around, will get twenty percent off of their first annual subscription. So, please support our channel by signing up today.

       " \" This video was made possible by Squarespace Whether you need a domain online store or website make it with Squarespace Today, we'll be exploring how China transformed into a communist state Despite thousands of years of dynastic rule and as always we'll need to wind back the clock to really understand how this process unfolded Throughout the 17th century and up until the 19th century the Ching dynasty Loosely reigned over China as it was plagued by regionalism and corruption to make matters worse European merchants arrived in China on mass during the 18th century these Westerners arriving were driven by fiscal interests and some would later say that it was the wave of Merchants, who would spell China's near ruin? Meanwhile in Japan things were looking up after their decisive victory over the Chinese in the sino-japanese war In Richard Bernstein's work. He writes this of the conflict Japan's major goal was the possession of Korea and Manchuria The vast landmass is just across the sea that were stepping stones towards the even larger prize, which was China This defeat prompted cries for reform and after a series of failed revolts including the 1899 Boxer Rebellion the Qing government found itself in an even more precarious position by 1911 the government was fully overthrown in what was called the Wu Chun Revolution the leaders of this revolution selected the exiled Intellectual Sun yat-sen to be China's first president in 1912 However, their territories were limited to southern China Meanwhile, the boy Emperor Puyi remained in power in the north. He was backed by General Yuan Shikai Who had the largest army in the region and therefore pretty much called the shots? Thus soon yot sent one XI Chi over to his side without bloodshed by offering him the presidency From there things didn't exactly go as planned. You want imposed a military dictatorship and egg Sun yat-sen after he formed the opposing Kuomintang or KMT in 1916 yuan proclaimed himself emperor of China pretty much missing the point of the rebellion in Ireland He quickly lost much of his support and after his death China was once again balkanized in two regions under the control of local Warlords after yuan died soon yat-sen returned to China and at the helm of the nationalist Kuomintang party was able to take power and impose yet another military government in 1921 shortly after in 1923 They sealed cooperation with the Communist Party of China or CPC in exchange for assistance in ending regionalism The CPC had been founded in the wake of the may 4th movement which involved a series of student protests formed in opposition to the Chinese government's Ineffective response to the Treaty of Versailles, which transferred what was formerly Chinese own land to the Japanese The may 4th movement popularized Marxism as a radical alternative to the Kuomintang really the only reason the CPC aligned itself with the KMT was so it could spread communism as it liberated each warlord state with the assistance of the much stronger KMT in 1925 soon yat-sen died leaving China in the hands of Chiang kai-shek who two years later initiated what was known as the white terror in response to a communist plot to overthrow him this resulted in the deaths of Thousands of members of the CPC in the aftermath communist leaders lead Lee Sung and Mao Zedong Began waging a guerrilla war against the Kuomintang While this was happening the soviet union who saw the CPC as their communist allies Directed it to take a more aggressive stance Against the Kuomintang as a result Lee Lisan ordered an offensive to be carried out against the Nationalists It was a disaster and led to his replacement by a group of Chinese intellectuals called d28 Bolsheviks with warlords still in control of numerous regions and the two major political factions of China in all-out war the Situation was looking worse than ever Seeing the turmoil unfold the shadow of Japan once again loomed over China in 1931 they sent roughly 45,000 men to occupy Chinese Manchuria with no troops to spare the Kuomintang was forced to concede without resistance Chiang now understood that he needed to defeat the CPC before China was fully invaded to this end Chang assembled the largest Kuomintang army yet And in 1934 encircled Mao's guerrilla forces stationed in the mountains The climax of this episode was the long march which began when the CPC devised a near Suicidal plan to break through Shang's encirclement and march over 6,000 miles to regroup in the north About half of the CPC's forces were lost when crossing the Xiong river a decision which the 28 Bolsheviks shouldered Responsibility for in the wake of this debacle mount took control of the Communists By the time the remnants of the CPC reached their northern destination only 10 percent of them were still alive Prompting now to launch a massive recruitment effort Recognizing that if the Japanese invaded both day and the Kuomintang would be destroyed Mao sought to form yet another United Front Shang was vehemently opposed to the offer but his generals weren't they took matters into their own hands taking Shang hostage and pressuring him to accept Mao's offer Chiang eventually decided to accept and formed what was called the second United Front in 1937 when Japan did invade that year the Kuomintang proved unable to fully repulse the invaders something which worried the Chinese people and now capitalized on this discontent to recruit even more men to his cause Furthermore his forces did not engage those of Japan very frequently allowing the Kuomintang to bear the of the Japanese onslaught After Japan surrendered to the Allies in 1945 The Kuomintang and CPC ended the second United Front It only took one year for the Chinese Civil War to rage on yet again the CPC was now armed with Leftover Japanese weapons and equipment had newfound support from the populace and faced a foe who suffered 3.2 million casualties Against the Japanese whereas the Communists lost approximately four hundred and forty thousand after a highly successful guerrilla campaign both Beijing and Nanking had fallen to the Communists with the capture of these two major cities It would not be long before Mao was victorious and the People's Republic of China was established Chiang kai-shek and the defeated Kuomintang government went into exile in Taiwan in 1949 which to this day still has the official name of the Republic of China under Mao 30 year reign tens of millions of people starved even so it is still debated to this day whether Mao Contributed to China's modernization or whether he delayed its development Either way the Chinese government still sees Mao as one of their founding fathers Now back to our sponsor recently Squarespace has made my life a lot easier this

      " Hi, I'm Griffin Johnson, the Armchair Historian. Today's video: What was life like in Nazi Germany?\n",
      " When one tries to imagine what life was like for the average German between the years of 1933 and\n",
      " 1945, what comes to mind? Many would likely envision it as a drab nightmarish\n",
      " totalitarian dystopia, and in many ways this was true, certainly for the sections of society\n",
      " that the Nazi's firmly repressed, but how much different was life like for the Germans who lived up to Hitler standards?\n",
      " Before we address the life of the average citizen,\n",
      " we must first understand what life was like for minorities, and as can be imagined the rights of these groups were essentially\n",
      " eliminated, almost as soon as Hitler took power in 1933. Jewish civil servants such as teachers, professors,\n",
      " engineers, and administrators were excluded from government employment within the first few months of Hitler's election.\n",
      " The Nazis used their newly acquired power to orchestrate what would be known as\n",
      " \"Kristallnacht\" or \"Crystal Night\" in which thousands of Jewish businesses, homes, and synagogues were burned or otherwise\n",
      " vandalized, their owners beaten and arrested.\n",
      " By 1941 almost all of Germany's remaining Jewish population,\n",
      " which 10 years earlier had numbered over half a million, were imprisoned in concentration camps.\n",
      " The Nazis embarked on an ideologically-fueled campaign against virtually all minorities and marginal groups of society\n",
      " including gypsies, homosexuals,\n",
      " Jehovah's Witnesses, and ethnic Slavs.\n",
      " One of the methods used in this campaign was forced sterilization. In the words of Richard Evans in his book \"The Third Reich in Power\"\n",
      " \"In essence the Nazi regime was using\n",
      " Sterilization to crush those areas of society that did not conform to the Nazi ideal.\"\n",
      " Another particular aspect of this campaign that has been written about repeatedly, is the Nazis eugenics program which sought to\n",
      " systematically breed out those the Nazis deemed \"untermenschen\" or\n",
      " subhuman.\n",
      " For example, state-appointed physicians were authorized and instructed to euthanize children that were considered, by the Nazis, to be\n",
      " unworthy of life. Up to one-hundred thousand Germans including twenty-thousand children were euthanized between 1939 and\n",
      " 1941.\n",
      " Now that we understand the experiences of those the Nazis persecuted,\n",
      " let's examine\n",
      " how life was for everyday citizens.\n",
      " While the role of men in society under the new regime was not much different from that of the previous, one women\n",
      " experienced a variety of new expectations the Nazis introduced what they saw as traditional German values for women,\n",
      " which included modesty, dedication to Christian (in this case Nazified)\n",
      " values, and most importantly the production of children, which the Nazis viewed as a\n",
      " crucial component of their plans to expand the German nation.\n",
      " In fact, a civil award: a German Mother's Cross, was established and given to women who bore at least four\n",
      " children. In schools, students were taught a curriculum that was designed to encourage\n",
      " discrimination and discourage racial mixing. To quote Richard Evans again:\n",
      " \"Teachers and pupils greet each other at the beginning and end of every lesson with the Nazi salute.\"\n",
      " The pupils listen to major political speeches on the radio in the school hall.\"\n",
      " As we mentioned, the primary objective of the Nazi school system was to ensure that the party's\n",
      " ideology became ingrained in the minds of students, something which was intended to produce loyal soldiers for future wars.\n",
      " Dating all the way back from 1922, the Hitler Youth and later on its female branch,\n",
      " the League of German Girls, was meant to prepare boys for military service and girls for motherhood. These\n",
      " organizations were incredibly popular in Germany and by 1939, over 90 percent of Germany's children were part of the Hitler Youth.\n",
      " During this time, even more innocuous\n",
      " institutions of German society began to take a National Socialists slant, as can be seen with the positive Christianity movement,\n",
      " which was a state-sponsored program to unite all of Germany's Protestant churches into one national church that would legitimize and support\n",
      " the Nazi agenda.\n",
      " Government, under the direction of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels,\n",
      " distributed millions of inexpensive radios to the people in order to make sure that important political messages could reach them.\n",
      " These measures, however, often did not produce the desired\n",
      " effect, as most people were only interested in carrying on daily life as it had existed before.\n",
      " Recognizing that most of the German people could not be fully indoctrinated, the government enforced its ideal German state through legislation.\n",
      " For example,\n",
      " it was required for both men and women aged 19 to 25 to commit a\n",
      " six-month tour of public labor, in which they fulfilled the Nazi concept of a social labor force.\n",
      " Women were then allowed to return home, but men were conscripted into the Wehrmacht or German military.\n",
      " This provided a steady source of manpower for the ultra-militaristic Nazi state. The Nazis also introduced the\n",
      " \"Volkswagen\" or \"People's car\", which was intended to provide each German  household with a vehicle, as part of Hitler's campaign to motorize\n",
      " Germany. In regards to economics, the Great Depression was taking a disastrous toll on the German people before the Nazis were elected.\n",
      " By 1933, unemployment stood at 35 percent and inflation was rampant.\n",
      " Naturally, the Nazis promised to improve the state of the German economy, something which earned them many votes in the election of 1933.\n",
      " Their first priority was to reduce the dismal amount of unemployment in Germany by initiating large public works\n",
      " projects such as the construction of canals and the\n",
      " \"Autobahn\" or \"Highway\". Hitler boasted his success in spite of the fact that many of the employment statistics that were used\n",
      " excluded significant portions of the population such as Jews and soldiers. Though\n",
      " the Nazis economic reforms have generally been considered effective, it took years for the unemployment rate to actually drop to stable levels.\n",
      " Despite promising peace, both during and after his election, Hitler would once again involve the German people in a large-scale war.\n",
      " As the need for resources to power the German military grew larger and larger, more countries were subjected to Hitler's conquest,\n",
      " something which escalated the war onto a global scale. As the conflict raged on, it quickly became apparent to most observers,\n",
      " even those within Germany, that the idealistic utopia that the Nazis hoped for would never come to fruition.\n",
      " The sheer number of casualties that the war produced, especially on the Eastern Front was overwhelming.\n",
      " When defeat finally did arrive, it would take nearly a half-century\n",
      " before life would return to normal, as the country was divided between the Democratic West and the Communist East, until they were reunited\n",
      " in 1990.\n",
      " One of the scientists who fled Germany in the 1930's was none other than Albert Einstein.\n",
      " Our sponsor for today, \"Brilliant\", allows you to master the kind of problem-solving and logic that would have been familiar to Einstein himself.\n",
      " Jumping into science, math, and physics sounds like an extremely daunting task, especially for an armchair historian like yourself,\n",
      " but \"Brilliant\" allows you to learn these concepts through fun bite-sized problems. In all of \"Brilliant's\" lessons\n",
      " they're both visuals and thorough\n",
      " explanations. If you're currently a student or just a lifelong learner, we highly recommend you start your free trial at \"brilliant.org/armchairhistorian\".\n",

       "[\" in the summer of 1940 the German war machine was Unleashed on France while German armies crashed into the low countries additional Panzer divisions emerged from the forests of the Arden bypassing France's meticulously planted defenses and outflanking the best of the French army within 2 weeks the battle was effectively lost and within 6 weeks France waved the white flag today it's often this act of surrender that defines the French wartime experience but for the millions of French in uniform it was only the beginning at the outbreak of the second world war in 1939 France's soldiers weren't always as one might imagine to start due to its horrific losses in the first world war French soldiers were often older than other combatants some were already in their late 40s secondly France's soldiers weren't always from Europe complimenting the Frenchmen in the military were large numbers of colonial troops from North and West Africa finally while France mobilized over 4.5 million soldiers only 3.1 million were actually available for combat in Mainland France of the soldiers actually in France most were stationed on the country's northern border with many of these garrisoning the magino line which fortified France's Frontier with Germany conditions on the magino line were mixed while many of the larger underground forts were well stocked and equipped boredom and claustrophobia soon set in among the garrisons any boredom that these soldiers may have felt however were soon Shattered by the Thunder of panzers and the screams of stukas the battle of France was a disaster for the French military while the Allied Forces in France fielded a similar number of troops to the Germans and the most modern tanks in the French Arsenal actually outclassed their German counterparts allied strategy had failed to embrace the evolution of warfare since 1918 French soldiers had been trained for an infantry based defensive war and were poorly prepared for the German Onslaught while many French soldiers fought bravely effective military resistance soon collapsed defeated and Scattered many French soldiers could only wonder what would come next before we

the time the smoke cleared over the battlefields of France up to 1.9 million French soldiers became prisoners of War some of these soldiers had been captured during the German offensive but most were surrendered by the French state after its June 22nd Armistice with Germany these soldiers many of whom had never fired a shot were marched into German captivity under the command of their own officers and quickly funneled into hastily prepared holding camps across France the German military was paralyzed by this massive influx of PS and were not prepared to process or care for their new captives in addition to the lack of food and Care the strain of taking in close to 2 million PS meant that these initial camps were very poorly guarded by the Germans hundreds of thousands of French soldiers would take advantage of this fact to quietly slip away into the French Countryside most however made no such Escape attempts a choice many would regret for the next fin years after an initial period of disorganization captured soldiers were separated into groups based on status Colonial PS stayed in France while native French soldiers were transported by train to Germany with their heads freshly shaven these men were then assigned to non-war related work details in keeping with the Geneva Convention these labor assignments typically involved farmw work but also included a variety of other Industries with substantially differing conditions some work was backbreaking but some work was not and death rates among French PS were comparatively [Music] low regardless of conditions French PWS often experienced profound loneliness and sometimes shame half of the PS were married and 39% had children 5 years in captivity meant that many French soldiers never saw their children take their first steps 5 years of captivity meant that many French soldiers had abundant time to reflect on their military defeat and 5 years of captivity meant that it would fall on other French soldiers to avenge them as German guns and bombs pummeled their positions French soldiers on the beaches of dunker fought desperately to allow their comrades to escape across the English Channel shortly after a French officer by the name of charl deal also arrived in Britain where he would make a spirited radio appearance announcing to the world that France would fight on and rallying his countrymen to join him in the UK his plea was mostly met with Silence of the French soldiers evacuated at dunker many had already been redeployed to France where they would be surrendered to the Germans and while 130,000 French soldiers remained in Britain at the time of Deal's address less than 3,000 chose to continue the fight the vast majority chose to drift back to France making up for this shortfall several colonies heeded Deal's Call to Arms and provided valuable military bases and soldiers until at least 1942 the vast majority of soldiers fighting for a free France would in fact be African free French military operations got off to a rocky start with a failed Naval assault on the Strategic Port of dhar French soldiers were then sent to assist the British in their campaign in East Africa against the Italians free French soldiers would cement their fighting reputation in 1942 however with their heroism in North Africa at this time Allied Forces in North Africa were facing an overwhelming assault by German and Italian forces under the command of Irwin raml Manning a section of the rapidly collapsing defensive line in Libya were 3,700 free French soldiers near bur Hakim during several weeks of intense fighting French forces were able to temporarily stall the German and Italian Advance before leading a breakout from their own defensive positions the heroism of the French soldiers was a massive morale boost for the disheart Allied Forces from that point forward the free French would be known by another name the fighting French but these accolades obscured a key fact there were other French who were [Music] fighting after France's defeat in June of 1940 the Germans allowed a French rump state to be formed in the south of the country under the leadership of the World War I hero Marshall Philip Pon to maintain its alleged Independence paton's vishi France was allowed to retain a small army of no more than 100,000 men some of these men who were often drawn from the former French military believed that they were forming the Vanguard of the force that would retake France unfortunately for them that was not to be vichi France's military was given explicit orders to not resist any German incursion into the country and when Germany finally occupied southern France in late 1942 French soldiers were ordered once again to lay down their arms amid this environment of collaboration and enforced compliance the milis Franz was established in 1943 as a fervent Pro vichi militia engaging in direct actions against the French Resistance and working closely with German forces to enforce the policies of the Nazi occupiers after Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union French far-right activists began to raise an expeditionary Force to Aid their fascist allies while initially promising to raise 15,000 soldiers for Hitler's anti-communist Crusade less than 3,000 were ready by the fall of 1941 some of these men ironically had fought the Germans barely a year prior after an extremely brief training period the so-called Legion of French volunteers against bolism set off for the Eastern front here the legion was thrown into the rapidly deteriorating battle for Moscow in the winter of 1941 suffering through frostbite artillery barges and constant Soviet attacks the French suffered horrendous casualties and were soon withdrawn from Frontline combat they lasted less than a month by 1944 the legion was disbanded and its troops were folded into the French waan SS Charlemagne division they were thrust into combat on the German home front and were nearly annihilated facing a Relentless Soviet offensive in Pomerania approximately 300 of these surviving troops were later redeployed to defend Berlin in the war's final days some of these men stood among the last to surrender most tragically of all however was the fate of of the 130,000 men from alsas Lorraine a german-speaking region of France considered ethnically German by Hitler French soldiers from alsas Lorraine were released from German captivity only to be drafted into the vermed and sent to the Eastern front where up to 40,000 would be killed in order to escape this fate some French soldiers began to make their way into the French interior where a new force was Rising on June 20th 1940 a French farmer cut the telephone wires to a German field headquarters 2 weeks later he was arrested and shot making him the first martyr of the French Resistance he would be joined by many more relatively few french citizens participated in any organized resistance but many parts of of French society resisted in more subtle ways these small actions or even just the appearance of resistance could be punished brutally which only served to spread the fire of rebellion across the country while a small number of French soldiers trickled to deal in the UK others chose to stay in France to continue the fight closer to home French Military Officers LED some of the many resistance groups that took root in France early in the war at first armed resistance in France was sporadic and disorganized members of resistance movements tended to be dissident soldiers or foreign Nationals who often vly disagreed on matters of strategy and politics however in 1943 two events would alter this situation deal sent a representative Jean malan to France to unite The Divided resistance groups Des by All Odds malal successfully United the resistance movement in France and brought it under control of deal however shortly after this success was betrayed by a fellow resistance member and executed by the Germans the newly United French Resistance would receive another windfall in 1943 when German occupied vichi France began to aggressively conscript young men to work in Germany many of these men some of them former soldiers fled to the resistance swelling their ranks with increased coordination and numbers the French Resistance finally began to play a role in Allied planning for the liberation of France when Operation Overlord the Allied invasion of France commenced on June 6th 1944 the resistance assisted by disrupting supply lines hampering Communications and ambushing German reinforcements the Allied Landings in southern France operation goon were also aided by resistance activities as the summer of 1944 came to an end French Resistance Fighters fought pitched battles in the scrublands of Southern France liberating large parts of the country from the retreating Germans it was here that the resistance also linked up with the free French forces who formed a large portion of operation Dragon strength French soldiers reunited at last marched onward to the liberation of their Homeland during the second world war French soldiers met a variety of Fates a large number would spend the war in German captivity only being released as Allied armies swept through Hitler's Empire of those who avoided capture in 1940 a few chose to join Deal's forces in Britain but most simply returned to France viewing the war as lost many continued to serve the vichi regime while a far smaller number enlisted directly to fight for the Third Reich some chose the path of resistance but many more simply Blended back into civilian life there is no single heroic or cowardly narrative that can be applied to these millions of lives history like war is a messy

       " \" on October 7th 2023 Hamas militants attacked Southern Israel from Gaza with rocket fire and barrier breaches targeting both military and civilian sites Israel retaliated with heavy bombings and a ground invasion in Gaza significantly escalating the conflict the violence impacted not only Gaza but also the West Bank and heightened tensions at the Lebanese border drawing Global

formation in 1987 during the First inata with a goal of establishing an Islamic State in historic Palestine including current day Israel Hamas gained prominence after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and subsequent defeat of f during the 2007 Battle of Gaza with Hamas taking over as the deao rulers in Gaza tensions and clashes with Israel increased East despite Hamas being designated a terrorist group by most western Nations their path of armed resistance remains key to maintaining support among Palestinians their cause aims to fight the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories like the West Bank raising tensions due to Israeli settlement expansions and a growing sense of Oppression among Palestinians these elements coupled with with Israel's economic and political isolation of Gaza have also been Central to the escalating hostilities amid Rising violence and political shifts in Israel a significant majority of Palestinians in the West Bank expressed support for armed resistance against Israeli occupation a 2023 poll conducted by the Palestinian Center for policy and Survey research revealed that 72% of pal iians endorsed groups like The Lion's Den and jenin Brigade known for their hard stance against the occupation this sentiment was fueled by Israel's increasingly hawkish policies and ongoing military actions in Palestinian territories which were perceived as dismissive of the two-state solution and precipitated frequent violence over the course of 2023 Palestinian grievances reached a critical point with escalating settler violence numerous administrative detentions and a sharp rise in Palestinian casualties fueling growing tensions as Hamas bolstered its fighting force warnings from the US and Egypt about its activities went unheeded by Israeli intelligence including mosad they underestimated Hamas dismissing detailed plans for a large-scale assault and an invasion invol involving drones and paragliders as beyond their capabilities concerns raised by the Israeli signals intelligence unit about hamas's preparations were ignored reflecting a belief that Hamas was contained and seeking to avoid fullscale war however that was not the case on October 7th around 6:30 a.m. Hamas commenced their Full Assault on Israel codenamed operation l oxa flood this offensive began with a widespread rocket barrage targeting key Israeli military and civilian locations simultaneously over 3,000 militants infiltrated the Israeli barrier using aerial drones to scout over and disable Israeli observation posts while Fighters used paragliders speedboats and Motor Vehicles to bypass security perimeters the capture of check points and breaching of Border fences allowed access for larger vehicles to pass through as Palestinian militants rapidly gained ground following the breach of Border checkpoints and fences the Hamas militants initiated an amphibious Landing in zikim where Israeli sources reported that 10 civilians were murdered at the beach with another nine gunned down in a nearby shelter the Israeli Defense Force responded by killing killing two attackers on the beach and destroying four vessels including two rubber boats nearby Hamas militants also captured a military base near nahal AZ leading to the deaths of at least two Israeli soldiers and the capture of six others intense fighting also ensued at the ree military base where Hamas temporarily seized control of the base and took several Israeli soldiers captive although the IDF later regained control Additionally the police station in stot fell under Hamas control with militants killing 30 Israelis including policemen and civilians Hamas targeted rural Israeli communities causing widespread destruction and civilian massacres multiple hostages were also taken from populated towns near the Gaza border a music festival near re faced an especially brutal attack with mass casualties and more hostages allegations of sexual violence against Israeli women supported by Israeli forensic evidence were also made Hamas and the Palestinian Authority disputed the mass casualties blaming them on Israeli strikes but Israeli police contended that their aerial response caused only a minor portion of the casualties primarily from Friendly Fire Israel's military response was initially slow with helicopters from the north facing difficulty distinguishing militants from civilians in the chaos Pilots initially bombarded targets indiscriminately attacking around 300 sites in Just 4 hours gradually Target selection became more cautious the confusion was worsened by militants employing tactics to blend in with civilians specifically they deliberately avoided running or making sudden movements to mimic typical civilian behaviors during Air Raids this tactic made it challenging for Israeli forces to distinguish them from local civilians in the area by 9:00 a.m. amidst growing disarray some helicopters engaged targets without prior clearance in a televised appearance prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel was at War and threatened to turn all the places where Hamas is organized and hiding into cities of ruins the IDF launched operation swords of iron signaling a fullscale military response Israeli forces mobilized extensively and a state of emergency was declared significantly restricting civilian movement in areas close to Gaza the idf's measures included a total blockade of Gaza cutting off electricity and Essentials leading to wide spread criticism from human rights groups allegations of using white phosphorus Munitions by Israel were reported by Human Rights Watch and verified by Amnesty International but denied by Israeli authorities by October 13th the IDF issued urgent evacuation warnings for Northern Gaza giving Palestinians just a day to relocate South faced with a harrowing decision many Palestinians remained in place as Hamas defying the IDF urged them to stay amidst a storm of international criticism of Israel's tactics the IDF made a controversial accusation they claimed Hamas was using civilians as human shields in response counter claims from the media emerged alleging that Israel had struck civilians along designated safe routes into Southern Gaza Israel disputed these counter claims maintaining their stance on the situation on the 17th of October tragedy unfolded in southern Gaza as Israeli air strikes while targeting Hamas once again wrought havoc on civilian areas over 70 lives were lost including those of families who had fled from northern Gaza seeking safety among them was Aman noal a senior figure in hamas's military wing while a victory for the Israelis further District leading to intense clashes with hamas's elkam brigades and the Democratic front's National resistance brigades these groups employed anti-tank missiles and heavy artillery against IDF vehicles with Israeli casualties giving impetus for further resistance from Palestinian militants Beyond engagements with the elkam brigades the idf's extensive use of air strikes was directed against the jabalia refugee camp on October 31st causing dozens of fatalities and injuries eyewitness reports described catastrophic scenes with the numerous casualties predominantly being women and children this attack in particular led to International outcry and several countries severing diplomatic ties with Israel the first group of evacuees including the critical wounded and foreign Nationals began leaving Gaza for each Egypt on November 1st a total of 500 evacuees were to be moved over several days with 200 already at the border meanwhile the jabalia refugee camp endured a second devastating bombing prompting the UN Human Rights office to express concerns about the potential War crime implications of such attacks 2 Days Later an ambulance Convoy was hit in an air strike killing 15 and injuring 60 the IDF claimed that the ambulances were being used by Hamas a claim that the Palestinian red crescent society and Hamas officials strongly denied strikes against a civilian school and Hospital claimed more lives on November 4th turkey condemning Israel's actions and their refusal to accept a ceasefire recalled its Ambassador meanwhile Palestinian militants continued to harass Vass Israeli units in pitched Urban battles claiming 24 Vehicles up to that point further strikes against hospitals led the Human Rights Watch to call for a weapons embargo on both Israel and Hamas this fell on deaf ears as the us pledged to supply Israel with $320 Million worth of precision guided bombs on November 13th the IDF began a number of operations aimed at clearing out underground tunnel networks and headquarters located beneath the city of Gaza in one of these raids the IDF claimed to have discovered a suspected Hamas holding area for Israeli hostages beneath the AL rentis hospital they also claimed to have found a calendar titled operation Al AXA flood linked to the 7th October Massacre but the interpretation of this calendar was contentious and widely debated reports of Civilian casualties were leaked after a raid on alifa hospital with the IDF claiming that they were there for humanitarian assistance Netanyahu also cited hostages as a reason for the IDF entering the hospital conflicting reports emerged about the IDF providing Aid at elifa where they claimed to have discovered weapons indicating a Hamas Command Center however recent investigations by The Washington Post found no such evidence of any Command Center evacuation notices in southern Gaza and a fuel induced Telecom blackout escalated concerns by November 20th IDF assaults against the Indonesia Hospital in Gaza Drew International criticism mostly due to the fact that a significant number of civilians and medical staff were still inside during the attack after a month of brutal fighting and mounting pressure throughout November a ceasefire agreement was finally reached on the 22nd between Israel and Hamas this included hostage releases and a temporary pause in hostilities facilitated by Egypt and Qatar the ceasefire aimed to seed a broader peace agreement unfortunately the brief Gaza truce collapsed on December 1st with Israel and the US blaming Hamas for the breakdown Israel resumed hos hostilities with air strikes especially in the southern city of K yunes and enforced evacuation procedures Hamas suspended hostage negotiations demanding a halt to attacks and the release of Palestinian prisoners for the IDF alleged discoveries of concealed weapons and militant equipment found throughout areas of Southern Gaza gave them further impetus to press their campaign the US called for renewed hostage negotiations and civilian protection but Amnesty International raised War crime concerns due to us-made weapons used in air strikes lacking military targets Fierce fighting and bombing in Gaza has intensified in the north with the IDF claiming to have uncovered another large weapons cache located adjacent to the lamal health clinic and Bay Leia school over December Israel shifted its military campaign to the more densely populated South this Focus not only complicated Israeli operations but greatly increased the risk of Civilian and Military casualties the IDF reorienting toward ground operations over air strikes

       " \" it is November of 1864 William Tumo Sherman restless and Vigilant watches as the railroad Depot illuminates what little is left of the Atlanta Skyline after a costly siege for the city had been one in September Sherman was gathering all the supplies he could to move onward to Savannah splitting Georgia and thereby the Confederacy in two to Aid in this the Union Army had to vacate Atlanta stripping it of any military worth for Atlanta's people it was a devastating loss for Sherman it was just the beginning as the American Civil War entered its fourth year the Union's High command was becoming increasingly desperate to end the conflict a grinding stalemate between generals Ulus srant and Robert E Lee in Virginia made prolonging the war unpopular and the November elections loomed on the horizon amid this backdrop the Atlanta Campaign of Brigadier General William tumpa Sherman would take place culminating in the Battle of Jonesboro where Confederate Railway supply lines to Atlanta were cut leading to Confederate Lieutenant General John Bell Hood evacuating the city and destroying rail cars full of ammunition in his Trail the union occupation of Atlanta began on September 2nd just 2 months before the presidential election providing Abra Abraham Lincoln a much needed win the newly promoted Major General Sherman set up his headquarters in the city and the few remaining civilians were ordered to evacuate hoping to divert Union attention away from Georgia the scattered Confederates coalesced around Hood to harass supply lines leading to Atlanta and wreak havoc in Tennessee after multiple false starts in pursuing The Runaway hood and contention with his superiors on what to do next Sherman sent a communication to Lincoln and Grant detailing his plans and requesting permission to proceed stating I propose we break up the road from Chatanooga and strike out with wagons for milleville Millan and Savannah until we can repopulate Georgia it is useless to occupy but utter destruction of its roads houses and people will their military resources I can make the March and make Georgia howl after much deliberation on November 2nd Grant simply

reelection Union Soldiers started tearing up Atlanta's Rail lines by the 15th Sherman's Army prepared to make its fateful 225m March to the coastal city of Savannah but first he ordered all of Atlanta's Industrial and Commercial capacity destroyed sparing only these Ci's churches and private homes despite this many residential areas were caught up in the fires by the time his army departed on the morning of the 16th nearly 40% of the City was destroyed with the major generals Henry slokum at his left flank and Oliver Howard at his right Sherman marched Southeast toward mon Sherman's Army comprising 62,000 men was predominantly infantry alongside this there was a 5,000 strong Cavalry Division and 2,000 artillery men equipped with 64 guns having obliterated their only Supply Route these soldiers were now reliant on the resources of the Georgia Countryside for sustenance throughout the entire 225m March foraging units were dispatched to Villages along their route to gather as much food as they could with specific instructions to avoid burglarizing civilian homes they were directed to focus on acquiring supplies from wealthier residents in reality these foragers saw nothing more than free real estate in addition to the seizing of livestock meat and Grains Union foragers ransacked homes for valuables clothing jewelry wigs anything that could be sold or shown off was Milford some Southern families opted to bury their possessions often for their slaves to lead soldiers to them Confederate defenses against Union pillagers were meager at best led by Lieutenant General William Hardy a Garrison of a few thousand militia at mon gathered to meet Howard's Union forces only to see their movements turn and head east of the Town it was a faint and Hardy caught on quickly that Sherman was making his Target ambiguous Beyond this ragtag Force at mon there were also roving gangs of Cavalry led by Major General Joseph wheeler these units were most effective at catching forgers in the act and distributed summary executions to any captured Yankees as Howard continued his faint around mon one of his accompanying Cavalry regiments was ambushed by wheelers and then lured into a trap as they gave Chase three brigades of the Georgia militia were making their way through Griswald Ville just a couple miles east of mon where Wheeler's Cavalry would leave their Union pursuers to deal with while this Skirmish did distract parts of Howard's column Superior Federal numbers quickly overwhelmed The Defenders causing the Georgia militia to suffer disproportionate casualties as the mounted forgers passed by the Richer parts of Northern Georgia they took the initiative not only to ruin Plantation property but to free the slaves who worked on such property to the average Southern Aristocrat those damned Yankees were Marauders and thieves for the men women and children held in bondage they represented an opportunity for Freedom the newly liberated slaves flocked to Union soldiers and followed them on their March eventually numbering in the thousands while a morally Good Deed accommodating such a large group of people off of rations and for became a challenge one that many of the officers on the March had opposing solutions to one of which eventually ended in disaster on the 23rd slom's Wing entered the state capital of milleville with the governor and state government fleeing there in the capital building Federal forces held a mock vote to repeal Georgia's secession to the union after seizing the political heart of Georgia without a shot being fired Sherman decided to increase Federal pressure against the Confederacy in addition to more time for foraging federal troops were given more free reign to Target any infrastructure that could Aid the South cotton gens Mills and other centers of manufacturing were burned shelled or rammed even the mansion and personal Plantation of former Governor how Cobbs was put to the torch save for the slaves quarters in addition hundreds of miles of rail line were slowly and meticulously uprooted by federal forces often with soldiers working in shifts using crowbars as they Twisted lines into shapes that were often impossible to repair as the columns began to close in on Savannah Sherman's men were being more frequently inundated by Joseph Wheeler's Confederate skirmishers fed up with the harassment Sherman's Cavalry commander Judson Kilpatrick detached to pursue their base at wboro as Union Cavalry broke through defensive lines and cut off Confederate access to Augusta Willer was forced to withdraw from the town severely diminishing his capacity to slow Sherman's Onslaught as the March progressed the terrain began to change as Union troops entered the low coastal plains of Georgia its low elevation was rich in swamp lands and marshes but not so much in plunder and forage adding further pressure as more fugitive slaves followed the Army on the night of December 8 one of Sherman's subordinates Brigadier General Jefferson C Davis reached ezzar Creek some 20 mi north of Savannah where Army Engineers prepared a pontoon bridge to allow safe passage in what is probably the worst atrocity committed on the March Davis ordered his 14,000 men to cross the bridge over the next few hours and at the last moment ordered the bridge to be cut and pulled back ashore preventing the 600 fugitive slaves from Crossing effectively abandoning them on the west west side of the creek their Fates left to the incoming Confederate Cavalry many of these freed men tried to swim across the icy water for safety some of whom were aided by desperate Union Soldiers but many more were killed or captured by wheeler men many of Davis's men objected to this decision some quite fervently including major James Connelly writing the idea of five or 600 black women children and Old Men being returned to slavery by such an infernal Copperhead as Jeff C Davis was entirely too much I told his staff officers of what I thought of such an inhumane barbarous proceeding despite complaints making it all the way up to Sherman the culpable Brigadier General Davis kept his position due to the lack of experienced field commanders however such an act could not stand to be repeated Sherman thought and must be reconciled this event would be the precipice for special field order number 15 an order made by Sherman to provide aable land for the now liberated slaves and their families considerably less compassionate was Sherman's solution to the use of enemy anti-personnel mines called Torpedoes at the time Sherman's men began encountering these devices as they approached within the final few miles to Savannah which had a devastating terrifying impact on Union morale as his wits end and having seen firsthand the treatment of Union PS by their captors Sherman ordered Confederate prisoners to clear the minefields by any means necessary even when they didn't know where these Torpedoes were planted finally on December 10th Sherman's main Force reached the outskirts of Savannah where they encountered confederate general hardy hardy with his 10,000 troops entrenched had established fortifications that halted the advance of Sherman's main column now hundreds of miles into their journey and hoping to get resupplied for a potential Siege Sherman sent a small contingency to take the coastal Fort mallister swiping away a small Confederate Garrison on the 13th and finally reaching the sea thus allowing the US Navy to resupply the beleaguered forces with a new Supply Route set up for the first time in over a month Sherman sent terms to Hardy on the 17th demanding the surrender of Savannah or face an overwhelming Force given the impossible decision to either surrender or persist Hardy chose neither on the 20th the Confederate Garrison crossed the Savannah River and made its way North forcing the city's mayor to present Sherman with the keys to the city himself General Sherman had done the impossible without Supply or communication from his fellow Northern comrades entirely under his command Sherman had brought Georgia to heal his army paraded through the countryside virtually unchallenged by Confederate resistance emboldened the now historic figure sought to replicate this strategy up through the Carolinas with the same commitment to the scorched Earth tactics that subdued Georgia Sherman was set to cut a bloody path all the way to meet Robert El in his rear flank in 1865 Sherman would add the burning of Colombia South Carolina and the capture of Confederate general Joseph E Johnston to his long list of accomplishments in a campaign that would persist until the end of the war all the while delivering what both his admirers and opponents would call his divine retribution in total it's estimated that Sherman's 37-day campaign did over $100 million in Damages in 1864 which today is about1 billion us with the vast majority of that damage providing little benefit to the marauding Army over 300 Mi of railroad and countless pieces of Southern infrastructure were trashed thousands of horses and cattle as well as millions of pounds of food were seized the March effectively isolated General Lee from most of his remaining peers and allowed Sherman to move north and threaten Lee's army of Northern Virginia with encirclement the March hammered in the first nail of the Confederate coffin culminating in Lee's surrender on April 9th 1865 the reputation of these actions remain debated among historians and history enthusiasts to this day but to truly get a grasp of the motivations behind the Mayhem one has to look at only the words of Sherman himself since the public mind has settled to the conclusion that the institution of slavery was so interwoven in our system that nothing but the interposition of War could have eradicated it I believe that the war was worth all that it cost in life and treasure\",\n",
       " \" North Korea has long been called The Hermit Kingdom through a mix of crippling International sanctions and its own isolationism the northern half of the Korean Peninsula has been virtually cut off from The Wider World however this state's isolation is hardly equivalent to weakness and the world would be foolish to forget that even Hermits can have claws in the aftermath of Japan's defeat in the second world war the Korean Peninsula was split in two the northern half occupied by the Soviets and the southern half by the Americans the Koreans people army or kPa was formed in 1948 to give Kim ilung the soviet-backed leader of Northern Korea the means to conquer the entire Korean Peninsula 2 years later in 1950 Kim elung attempted just that and drove his army all the way to Busan before being defeated by an American Le Counterattack the timely intervention of China saved the newly declared Democratic People's Republic of Korea from complete collapse but the ceasefire that ended the conflict proved to be a frustrating return to the status quo Korea would remain divided in the subsequent decades the unresolved tensions of the Korean war came to define the role of the kPa while the exact tactics and strategies of the kPa have shifted considerably over the years two missions have remained consistent ensuring the stability of the Kim family regime and providing the North Korean state with the means to dominate the Korean Peninsula the first of these missions the protection of the Kim family regime heavily influences the strict and authoritarian structure of the kPa Kim Jong-un the current leader of North Korea is the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army and is the ultimate decision maker in all military matters for the state the Loyalty of the military to Kim alone is ensured by the general political Bureau tasked with providing extensive political indoctrination and the ministry of State security it is a secret police force that reports directly to their Supreme Commander since 2013 Kim Jong-un has also carried out extensive purges to further ensure loyalty resulting in the replacement of up to 80% of the kpa's top commanders as long as the military remains loyal to the Kim family any internal opposition to their rule can be crushed Mass surveillance is a sad reality for the population of North Korea with seemingly every aspect of

code historian the second mission of the kPa a the domination of the Korean Peninsula is closely linked to the geopolitics of North Korea and has shifted significantly over the years in the immediate decades following the Korean War strong Soviet and Chinese Aid gave North Korea a technological and economic Edge over its Southern neighbor emboldening the nation's military planners to build an army that could go on the offensive and strike deep into South Korean territory with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 however economic and military aid to North Korea halted and the country entered an economic and humanitarian death spiral that it has never truly recovered from additionally as the economy and population of South Korea rapidly grew it became increasingly unlikely that North Korea could win any conventional military campaign on the peninsula once the more powerful of the two koreas North Korea increasingly found itself on the back foot the present-day strategy and structure of the kPa reflects this unfavorable reality gone are the days where North Korean planners imagined sweeping offensives into the South instead the Korean People's Army has increasingly focused on asymmetric Warfare deterrence and coercion if the kPa cannot dominate the Korean Peninsula through conventional means it will dominate it through fear while North Korea is one of the world's poorest countries it spends up to 25% of its GDP on defense and possesses the world's fourth largest military with nearly 1.3 million active Personnel of the five service branches of the kPa the Strategic Force has become by far the most important in North Korea's national defense strategy although North Korea's nuclear program dates back to the 1950s North Korea's nuclear capabilities have quite literally exploded since its first successful nuclear test in 2006 under Kim Jong-un in particular North Korea's nuclear Arsenal has grown exponentially while the exact size and capabilities of the country's nuclear stockpile is unknown recent estimates suggest that North Korea possesses between 35 and 65 nuclear devices with anywhere from 4 to 12 added every year the kpa's Strategic Force claims to operate ballistic missiles that could launch these weapons into South Korea Japan or even the United States although it should be noted that there is no conclusive evidence for this for North Korea the possession of nuclear weapons acts as a key deterrent and bargaining chip signaling to the world the cost of any potential assault on the country this threat is underlined by Kim jong-un's continued assertion that he alone will make any decision to use North Korea's nuclear Arsenal meaning that any perceived threat to his power could end in armag gedon the largest branch of the kPa the ground force also plays a key role in North Korea's strategic calculus with over a million soldiers 4,000 tanks and 21,000 artillery pieces the ground force still forms the core of the Korean people's Army's strength despite its vast number of soldiers and armored vehicles however the ground force is judged largely incapable of carrying out large-scale offensive operations due to its limited Logistics and hopelessly outdated equipment While most Frontline divisions of the ground forces operate Cold War era equipment such as the t62 or btr60 the kPa does still field equipment as old as the t34 however the lack of modern mechanized capabilities does not make the ground force harmless to begin the Infantry heavy force is well suited to defend the demilitarized zone on the North Korean border which has been fortified with extensive tunnel networks bunkers and minefields approximately 70% of the ground Force's considerable strength is concentrated on this border making any enemy breakthrough exceptionally challenging additionally North Korea's massive paramilitary organization known as worker peasants Red Guard possesses over 5 million members and would be able to supplement the ground force in times of War providing the kPa with a nearly inexhaustible supply of troops and the ability to wage a protracted Guerilla campaign against any Invader finally rounding out the kpa's focus on deterrence and Terror the ground force maintains nearly 6,000 artillery systems within range of South Korean population centers with essentially zero warning these weapons give North Korea the capability to cause an estimated 100,000 casualties an hour in the opening stages of any conflict with South Korea these casualty numbers could be even higher if the ground force chooses to launch its ample supply of chemical and biological rounds in the skies above the ground force merciless bombardment the North Korean Air Force would also be active in any potential conflict with 110,000 personnel and an estimated 545 combat capable aircraft the kPa Air Force is a formidable organization on paper however with many of its aircraft such as the Mig 15 dating back to as early as the 1950s the Air Force would likely not last long in any modern conflict compounding this issue are fuel shortages and maintenance problems which result in the average North Korean pilot training for as little as 15 hours every year which is less than the average American pilot flies every month nevertheless the North Korean Air Force also Fields the heaviest concentrations of anti-air weapons on Earth making enemy air superiority over the country far from certain the kPa Navy is the smallest branch of North Korea's armed forces and is like other branches primarily focused on deterrents with only two naan class frigs dating from the 1970s the kPa Navy's conventional surface capabilities are essentially non-existent Instead North Korea operates over 370 small attack craft and a fleet of over 70 diesel electric submarines split between the country's two coasts While most of these systems are significantly outdated and would likely serve as little more than target practice to more modern navies if they ventured too far from North Korea's Coast the sheer number of these craft means that they could prove sufficient to threaten supply lines and disrupt any attempted amphibious attack standing out from the rest of its Fleet however North Korea has built two submarines claimed to be capable of launching ballistic missiles though the true ability of these craft to successfully launch a nuclear nulear Warhead remains an open question the world may never want to find out the final branch of the kPa is also its most elite the Special Operations force is perhaps the largest Special Forces organization in the world with up to 200,000 soldiers of these elite soldiers about 88,000 are estimated to be under the direct command of the Special Operations Force while the rest are spread out over the other branches compared to the rest of the Korean People's Army the Special Operation force is provided with the best available equipment though this is still rudimentary by Western standards in independent operations special forces are trained to be inserted behind South Korean lines through either amphibious or Airborne methods these Elite Personnel would then be tasked with disrupting South Korean supply lines and targeting critical infrastructure at the unit level Special Operation soldiers also provide reconnaissance and light infantry capabilities to the less well equipped Ground Force complimenting their conventional military North Korea also possesses potent cyber warfare capabilities North Korean cyber operations support the country's military goals by giving the Kim regime a deniable way to spy on and intimidate its adversaries us intelligence Services notably linked North Korean cyber forces to the 2014 Sony picture hack which may have been motivated by the upcoming release of the movie the interview North Korea also uses its cyber operations to steal from financial institutions around the world allowing the capability to potentially pay for itself so where will the Korean People's Army go from here to begin it's very likely that North Korea will continue to give nuclear weapons and the Strategic force a leading role in the nation's military strategy it was once hoped that North Korea Korea could be convinced to give up its nuclear weapons but with the possession of nuclear weapons now legally enshrined in the country's Constitution North Korea seems to have firmly chosen its path next it is likely that North Korea will continue to utilize unconventional methods to undermine its enemies an example of this strategy is the ongoing transfer of artillery rounds from KPA storehouses to the battlefields of Ukraine finally even though North Korea's nuclear capabilities will likely continue to advance this will probably not be the case for the rest of the kpa's Arsenal critical shortages across the entire defense sector mean that the kPa remains largely incapable of modernizing its Force to any significant degree in other words anticipate more nukes but don't expect the t-34s to go anywhere just yet the Korean People's Army remains a deadly threat to any wouldbe Invaders but many shortcom comings remain forged in the violence of the Korean War the kPa is well suited to the defense of its Homeland and focuses its relatively limited resources on deterrence and Terror Cold War era equipment and poor Logistics make any offensive operation into South Korea a virtual nonstarter but kPa artillery and missiles could still devastate South Korean population centers at a moment's notice more worryingly as North Korea acquires the material for up to 12 nuclear devices every year the chances for peace on the Korean Peninsula grow ever closer to going up in smoke check out our website armchair history TV for

Heritage effectively doubling its territory this dramatic expansion was more than a geopolitical shift it was the Fulfillment of the long cherished dream of a greater Romania however these newly acquired regions each came at the cost of ethnic Division and Brewing geopolitical tensions suddenly Hungarian Bulgarian Ukrainian Jewish Romani and German minorities comprised about 30% of the population in some of the newly acquired areas Romanians themselves were in the minority diplomatically Romania's expansion led to entanglements with neighboring countries Hungary coveted transylvania's return Bulgaria aimed to regain Southern doia and the Soviet Union set its sights on bessarabia given this precarious situation border security became a top priority the Romanian government thought that their best chance of securing these borders was through joining the League of Nations alongside aligning with France's Eastern European security system to counter Hungarian threats Romania also allied with Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia to form the little anant in 1920 a mutual defense treaty with Poland in 1921 aimed to safeguard against the Soviet Union however the 1930s brought a urgence of German and Soviet power Germany backed Hungarian claims on Transylvania while the Soviet Union coveting basarabia was viewed as an unreliable Ally due to Romania's strong

Nations appeared ineffective isolated and seeking a powerful backer Romania cautiously shifted its stance toward Germany the furer requiring Romanian oil for Germany's impending War efforts redirected hungary's Focus to Czechoslovakia thus temporarily reducing tensions with Romania Hitler also made conciliatory gestures promising to respect Romania's borders in exchange for economic cooperation despite strengthening ties with Germany Romania maintained a balanced foreign policy preserving good relations with France and establishing new connections with Great Britain seen as a counterbalance to France's diminishing influence against the backdrop of Shifting alliances two pivotal forces dominated Romania's internal politics King Carol II and the radical Iron Guard King Carol ascended to the throne in 19 1930 under unusual circumstances and aimed to consolidate power aspiring toward a royal dictatorship his rule deepened internal conflicts especially regarding ethnic minorities in contrast to Carol's tolerance of diverse ethnicities the Iron Guard strongly opposed moderate views on minorities this fascist organization emerging from a group of nationalist University students criticized the political system for being too accommodating toward Jews and hungarians it advocated for a Romania centered on ethnic Romanians and proposed a radical brutal solution to the minority problem purifying the nation by eliminating those they viewed as undesirable with a particular focus on Jews whom they accused of undue influence and ties to the Soviet Union the tension between King caroll's authoritarian Ambitions and the iron guard's radical nationalism led to a volatile political climate in Romania the Iron Guard seeing an increasingly powerful rival in Carol II engaged in a power struggle directly challenging the king's Authority this internal conflict unfolded as Romania's external alliances wavered illustrating a nation struggling with its identity and direction at the very moment Europe was descending into war even even before German armies stormed into Poland in September 1939 Romania strived for neutrality following the Munich agreement in 1938 it had secured a commitment to its independence from both Great Britain and France similar to Poland's guarantee however Romania's position during the early stages of the war was a delicate Balancing Act while leaning toward the west Romania welcomed polish refugees yet simultaneously Inked beneficial trade agreements with Germany under threat of conflict much to the Allies dismay internally King Carol opposed the Iron Guard even though he employed similar paramilitary and anti-semitic tactics his abolishment of the 1923 Constitution strengthened his grip on power however tensions escalated when Carol ordered the execution of Iron Guard leader Cornelio kru in 1938 prompting the group to assassinate prime minister Armand k enescu in 1939 in retaliation Carol then executed hundreds of Iron Guard members these efforts to suppress the fascist movement were Complicated by geopolitical shifts in the summer of 1940 with France a crucial Ally succumbing to German invasion Carol turned to Germany for support softening his position against the Iron Guard and implementing anti-semitic laws oblivious to the molotov ribbon trop pact Romania was confronted with Soviet demands for bessarabia and Northern bavina under German pressure Romania seeded these territories resulting in the capture of over 40,000 Romanian troops stationed there smelling blood Hungary and Bulgaria then pressed their own territorial claims on Romania to maintain Regional stability Hitler brokered the second Vienna award in August 1940 resulting in Romania seeding Northern Transylvania to Hungary and Southern doia to Bulgaria this territorial session in 1940 soon sparked a political crisis undermining King Carol's Authority in an attempt to stabilize his Reign Carol appointed General Ian antonescu as prime minister though this soon backfired as antonescu ousted the king in a Cuda forming a new government with the Iron Guard in September 1940 the fragile Coalition between General antonescu and the Iron Guard crumbled quickly their government fixated on excluding Jews from Romanian Society saw a clash in approaches antonescu favored a systematic exploitation of Jewish properties whereas the Iron Guard in disarray from previous purges resorted to anarchic violence against Jews and other minorities this culminated in a horrific prgram in January 1941 where the iron guard's rebellion in Bucharest led to unspeakable acts of violence against Romanian Jews antonescu more concerned about lawlessness and his authority quashed the uprising and expelled the Iron Guard from Power antonescu Purge of the Iron Guard did not leave Jews any safer however instead his regime perpetrated widespread massacres and deportations in bessarabia bavina and transnistria this Romanian Le genocide SE separate from the Nazis Final Solution resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Jews characterized by its brutality and efficiency these actions reflected the deep-seated anti-Semitism of the time and Romania's willingness to autonomously persecute Jews far from Nazi coercion aligning closely with Nazi Germany antonescu permitted German troop movements through Romania for campaigns against Yugoslavia and Greece esteemed by Hitler antonescu regime gained stability and stronger ties with Germany after removing the Iron Guard his ultimate aim was to recover Romania's lost territories especially Northern Transylvania still controlled by Hungary by supporting Germany's war effort against the Soviet Union antonescu hoped to leverage his loyalty and persuade Germany to compel Hungary into returning Northern Transylvania back to Romania joining operation Barbarosa on June 22nd 1941 Romania committed more troops than all of Germany's other allies combined with nearly 900,000 Men by October the campaign's early success included reclaiming bessarabia and Northern bavina from Soviet control sparking public Jubilation in Romania Romanian soldiers often motivated by aspirations to restore pre-war borders and indoctrinated to believe they were fighting judeo bolshevism were initially enthusiastic for some this fervor was rooted in a mix of religious fervency and prevalent anti-semitic and anti-communist sentiments after recapturing bessarabia Romania urged by Germany pressed further into the Soviet Union general antonescu driven by the ambition to reclaim further lost territories approved sending Romanian forces into the arduous Siege of Odessa from August to October 1941 confronted with robust Soviet defense the Romanian Army relied on traditional infantry tactics facing High casualties and strategic challenges The Siege marked by intense combat and significant Soviet counteroffensive underscored the Romanian military's limitations German air support became crucial especially in countering Soviet advances highlighting Romania's dependence on its access allies in this critical campaign the fall of Odessa led to a heinous grum against Jews by Romanian troops declared the capital of the new transnistria governor it the city experienced severe oppression under its Romanian occupiers the primarily Ukrainian region suffered from food extraction and forced labor and also served as a Dumping Ground for deported Romanian Jews with up to 120,000 dying in the harsh winter of 1941 to 42 these actions reflected R mania's independent policies rather than German coercion the pace of Advance slowed into 1942 yet antonescu committed more troops notably in Crimea and the Caucasus aiming for Stalingrad in the Grim winter of 1942 Romanian troops aligned with Germany in the Battle of Stalingrad faced a dire situation underere equipped and thinly manned with divisions like the first infantry operating at a mere quarter of the their required strength they confronted a Relentless Soviet offensive Fierce artillery barges and brutal cold ofus 20 Celsius battered the Romanian lines their anti-tank guns largely ineffective against Soviet armor left them relying on grenades and Molotov cocktails despite initial resistance they faced Retreat or encirclement the general lasar group encircled and refusing surrender was decimated with only a single Battalion managing A desperate escape the fourth Romanian Army trapped in the encirclement at kalak nadanu witnessed six infantry divisions and a Cavalry division fall the aftermath of Stalingrad was devastating Romania suffered 181,000 casualties this number represented 16 of the 18 engaged divisions amounting to half of its active military forces Additionally the Romanian Air corps lost 73 aircraft a subsequent Soviet counter offensive further devastated Romania's military capabilities severely weakening its Frontline forces by February 1943 post Stalingrad the alliance between Germany and Romania began to deteriorate the Germans unfairly blamed the Romanians for the setback which fueled increasing skepticism in Romania about the outcome of the war although the Romanian Army great weakened by the Stalingrad disaster received modern German equipment it was not enough to make up for the substantial losses in Manpower and material in 1943 while much of the Romanian Army retreated back home some units remained notably around 66,000 soldiers in Crimea for anti-partisan operations their evacuation delayed by Hitler's refusal began only in April 1944 amidst a Soviet effect offensive resulting in further Romanian casualties by Spring 1944 the conflict reached Romanian soil a Soviet offensive in marched pushed German and Romanian forces from Ukrainian territories and parts of bukovina and bessarabia temporary German support stabilized the front but the soviet's August offensive shattered the Romanian units the reconstituted sixth Army under Romanian command was encircled and destroyed further weakening Romania's already battered military forces as Romania faced mounting losses in 1944 the inevitability of defeat dawned upon many

president over a decade Saddam enhancing Iraq's economy and infrastructure Rose to power becoming president on July 16th 1979 his rule commenced with the executing of 22 party members a move indicative of the ruthless regime that followed culminating in further executions and consolidating saddam's absolute control despite saddam's harsh methods to quell opposition his position remained vulnerable his regime advocating Arab Unity and nationalism faced challenges due to Iraq's significant non-arab populations especially the Kurds who did not align with the Arab Centric ideology

war the Sha Muhammad Raza palavi had centralized power embarking on extensive industrialization and westernization he aligned Iran against the Soviet Union and procured advanced American Weaponry the

his vision faced opposition leading to rebellions across Iran including the loyal Rich majority Arab province of kusan where conflict arose against K's mostly Persian supporters the rebels were swiftly defeated but this wasn't the last Strife kistan would experience amid the chaos in Iran Saddam Hussein saw both danger and opportunity he considered K's Shia theocracy as a threat to his Sunni Le rule in Shia majority Iraq Saddam strategy involved claiming the shat Al Arab Waterway and Iran's Arab majority kistan Province seizing these areas aimed to extend his influence undermine Iran by seizing its oil reserves and weaken K's challenge Saddam also counted on Iran's Revolution induced disarray to hinder its response to Iraqi military actions by the summer of 1980 as various Iranian factions squabbled for power Saddam Was preparing for war in June aerial intelligence was being collected over Iran and by early September the Iraqi military had seized two disputed Villages along the border on September 16th Saddam held a closed door meeting with the highest political officers in the country 6 days later on September 22nd 1980 Iraq invaded Iran the opening of Iraq's offensive did not go as planned Iraqi aircraft aimed to surprise and disable Iran's American equipped Air Force but failed to achieve decisive results leading to Iran destroying about 30 Iraqi planes and gradually gaining air superiority on the ground however Iraqi Army units initially fared better they crossed the shot Al Arab Waterway advancing along three fronts across the Iran Iraq border this caught local Iranian units off guard as they were unprepared and inadequately equipped to counter the Iraqi advancement by late 1980 Iran's military was significantly weakened with around 60% desertions and substantial purges in its officer Corp initially Iraq faced only local militias police and spare units of Iran's Islamic revolutionary guard despite their disadvantages Iranian forces mounted unexpectedly strong resistance in some areas notably in the southern city of cormar here despite being being vastly outnumbered and outgunned they engaged Iraqi forces in over a month of intense Urban Warfare effectively stalling the Iraqi offensive when Iraq captured kmar on October 24th Iran had managed to mobilized reinforcements halting further Iraqi ground progress contrary to saddam's expectations of a fragmented and demoralized Iran The Invasion unified Iranians under K's leadership facing an external threat they rallied to kaman's call to defend Islam and the Revolution by November recognizing the conflict wouldn't be brief Saddam adjusted his strategy as Iraqi forces besieged kastan both Nations prepared for a protracted war in January 1981 Iran shifted from defense to offense with operation Nasser targeting Iraqi Siege lines near desil despite their skill and being a equipped with M60 and Chieftain tanks Iranian forces couldn't break through as the Iraqis forewarned decisively repelled the offensive in a 4-day tank battle while Iran's tank Crews managed to inflict considerable damage the operation resulted in the loss of hundreds of Iranian tanks and armed Vehicles operation nasser's failure plunged Iran into Political turmoil the Iranian president a key advocate of the offensive faced impeachment triggering internal conflict akin to a civil war amidst this chaos K's faction backed by the Army Consolidated more power positioning the Ayatollah to lead Iran in the ongoing war with Iraq consequently Iran resorted to cannibalizing parts from its sophisticated equipment to maintain its military capabilities as the war continued Iran discreetly obtained spare parts and Munitions from Nations like the United States and Israel who wished to prolong the conflict for their own interests conversely Iraq faced fewer constraints in rearming sourcing arms from various countries like the Soviet Union France and Greece however this rearmament was costly and with declining oil revenues due to the war Saddam resorted to borrowing up to $1 billion monthly from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia the aftermath of operation Nasser revealed a severe shortage of military supplies for Iran weapon availability became crucial for both Iraq and Iran Iran's Arsenal primarily Western made included F4 Phantoms F14 Tomcats Chieftain and M60 tanks these Advanced weapons occasionally gave Iran an advantage but Western sanctions made Replacements unattainable in September 1981 the Iran Iraq Wars Dynamic shifted as Iran aimed to recapture abidan unlike the failed operation Nasser this Iranian offensive took the Iraqis by surprise leading to a hasty Iraqi Retreat across a pontoon Bridge leaving behind significant equipment Iran claimed the capture of 160 armored vehicles 5 155 mm artillery pieces and 150 other vehicles significantly boosting their morale this success propelled Iran to launch more offensives with the war turning unfavorable and Iraq's economy deteriorating Saddam proposed withdrawing from kusan for peace but Iran rejected the offer Iran's momentum continued with operation undeniable victory in March of 1982 emulating World War I tactics Iran bombarded Iraqi positions with artillery followed by mass infantry assaults despite heavy Iranian casualties the assaults were effective leading to the recapture of desol and the capture of over over 15,000 Iraqi prisoners by April's end approximately 70,000 Iranian infantry and 200 tanks stormed cormar resulting in a fierce battle the second in 2 years for the city the battle prolonged for weeks intensified under a lingering fog that led to intense Close Quarters combat ultimately Saddam ordered a disorderly Retreat from cormar forfeiting nearly all of Iraq's initial territorial gains with the vast majority of Iranian territory now liberated and its military seemingly ascendant Ayatollah Ki expanded his goals for the war Iran subsequently announced that it would now be seeking regime change in Iraq with the specific aim of capturing and trying Saddam Hussein as a war criminal for Saddam the war he had started now became a fight for personal survival following their Retreat from cormar Iraq fortified the area around Basra and its oil fields with a defense system dubbed the iron ring this stronghold was meant to Halt the Iranian Advance decisively on July 13th 1982 Iran tested these defenses with operation Ramadan launching an offensive into Iraqi territory with 90,000 troops crossing the shot Al Arab Waterway they penetrated 10 mi into Iraq but were eventually stopped the 70,000 Iraqi Defenders were held multiple Iranian assaults over the ensuing months leading to Iran abandoning the operation having suffered 10,000 fatalities and significant vehicle losses the iron ring had effectively withstood the Iranian offensive despite the setback in operation Ramadan Iran remained Resolute in the following years they initiated a long series of offensives against Iraqi defenses but none significantly shifted the war's trajectory repeated Iranian infantry assaults met with staunch Iraqi resistance resulting in a stalemate with neither side gaining substantial ground faced with this impass and eager to break the deadlock in southern Iraq both Nations resorted to more unconventional and increasingly inhumane tactics including the widespread use of chemical weapons attacks on civilians and the use of child soldiers these elements underscored the war's brutality but are sensitive topics for a platform like YouTube to view the uncensored version of this video along with countless other hours of content be sure to become a member to armchair history TV Link in the description below despite the horrors of War by 1985 the prolonged conflict had drained both Iran and Iraq leaving them unable to launch major offensives the front lines largely unchanged for a while saw a dramatic shift in June 1986 when Iran captured the Alfa Peninsula this strategic Victory denied Iraq sea access and established an Iranian presence west of the shat Al Arab this significant gain posed a continuous threat to the major Iraqi city of Basra which soon found itself under Iranian Siege in preparation for their assault on Basra the Iranians had purchased over $1 billion in Arms from China and Eastern Europe and amassed up to 200,000 troops including some of their most elite units at the beginning of 1987 Iran launched its Long awaited offensive aiming to seize Basra and accelerate saddam's downfall to Iran this assault was known as operation carala 5 to Iraqis it would become known as the Great Harvest the Iranians launched a fierce attack that caught the overly confident Iraqis off guard rapidly advancing into basser's suburbs and breaking through five of the city's six defensive Rings through intense combat and extensive use of mustard gas Iraq managed to Halt the Iranian Onslaught turning the Swift Advance into a grueling 3-month Siege with no further progress to the dismay of the Iranians the next significant turn in the war would come from an Iraqi counter offensive the tie turned with Iraq's operation blessed Ramadan beginning on April 17th 1988 coinciding with the start of Ramadan at dawn 1,400 Iraqi artillery units bombarded Iranian positions with explosive and chemical shells this was followed by an assault of up to 100,000 Iraqi soldiers on the Ala Peninsula southeast of Basra they rapidly ousted the Iranians from their significant territorial gains marking one of the war's quickest reversals capitalizing on this success Iraq escalated the operation into a larger offensive eventually driving the Iranian military out of Iraq by July 1988 a month later Iran and Iraq agreed to seize hostilities returning to their pre-war borders after nearly 8 years of brutal conflict and the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives both Iran and Iraq claimed Victory but the aftermath of the Iran Iraq war had complex and enduring consequences in Iran the Revolution was preserved potentially strengthening K's grip on power however the war inflicted massive economic losses estimated in the hundreds of billions and left extensive destruction across the country in Iraq Saddam Hussein's regime remained intact but his territorial Ambitions were unmet and the nation was burdened with crippling debt much of it owed to the small but oilr neighbor Kuwait although the Iran Iraq war had concluded it set the stage for continued conflict in the Middle East thanks again to nid AI for

       " \" it is the early 1970s while the world's attention is fixated on the jungles of Vietnam another conflict equally intense and complex was unfolding in the thickets of southern Africa like most conflicts to come out of Africa the origin of rhia's struggle can be traced back to the colonial era in the 19th century the resourcer areas of masona land and maab land came to the atten of British mining magnate Cecil roads making use of his own Venture the British South Africa company RADS was able to force his way into the region despite resistance from indigenous Shona and indele communities over time British settlers flocked to the area looking for work and land to call their own here the British South Africa company was given complete control over the area's Administration in 1895 this commercial Venture was officially named rhia in honor of their company's founder despite numerous treaties Stark contrasts in politics and issues of land ownership between white settlers and the local black population swed seeds of racial tension this Discord simmered beneath the surface persisting even as the region transitioned from a corporate charter into a self-governing colony under the British crown in 1923 to different at it from northern Rhodesia this transition came with the official renaming of Southern rodesia throughout decolonization in the 1960s British Africa moved toward granting Independence via the policy of no Independence before majority rule this sparked Panic among the ruling class of white rodians who feared upheaval akin to the chaos that racked the Belgian Congo post independence disenchanted by the British labor government's perceived favoritism toward African Liberation rhia's white minority government brazenly declared independence on November 11th 1965 via the unilateral Declaration of Independence or Udi for the rodians this was perceived as an act of survival as prime minister Ian Smith stated rodesia did not want to seize independence from Britain it was forced upon us this internationally unrecognized Act aimed to maintain control amidst geopolitical shifts isolating rodesia internationally with only covert support from South Africa and Portuguese mosm Beek as rodesia sank deeper into racial and economic turmoil the fervor for majority rule among black nationalists intensified and political discourse shifted toward a path of armed resistance 1961 to 1963 witnessed the rise of two nationalist factions whose resistance was key to instigating the coming conflict though United in their goal to dismantle white minority rule these factions differed in ideologies ethnic allegiances and military tactics one of the challenges I face as a content creator and a business owner is the sheer amount of junk mail and

seats against 50 for whites a stark contrast given Africans made up 96% of the population first was the Zimbabwe African people's Union or zapu led by Joshua and KO zapu primarily Drew support from the indell ethnic group although it claimed to represent all Rhian Africans its alignment with Marxist leninist principles shaped its strategies zapu favored conventional military structures and engaged Rhian for forces in traditional Warfare its military Wing known as the Zimbabwe people's revolutionary army or zipra was first commanded by Alfred Nikita Menina Soviet backing provided zipra with Superior Equipment and zipra combatants typically wore camouflage uniforms and were less dependent on local populations for supplies enabling a more traditional military approach against Rhian forces next was the Zimbabwe African National Union or zanu which split off from zapu in 1963 Guided by indin ningi SLE and later Robert Mugabe zanu primarily garnered support from the Shona ethnic group and embraced a maist ideology with China providing support the military Wing known as the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army or zanla was run by a committee within the party zanla utilized Guerilla Warfare exploiting the rural landscape and and engaging local communities to conduct a prolonged people's war against Rhian forces opposing these factions were these Security Forces operating under the Rhian government during the early Wars of the conflict this responsibility was handled by the British South Africa police who made use of specialized teams like the police anti-terrorist unit to combat Guerilla activity in remote areas of the country when it became clear that the conflict would drag on the security force was ramped up to include the Rhian Army and Air Force the Army in particular made use of specialized units like the formidable Rhian light infantry and the rhia regiment which formed the core of the defense against insurgencies the light infantry known as troopes were renowned for their airborne and combat prowess often leading counterinsurgency operations Elite groups such as the cus Scouts and the Special Air Service enhanced the arm Army's capabilities with their expertise in reconnaissance covert operations and high stakes Airborne missions the rodian African rifles predominantly black soldiers commanded by white officers leveraged their local knowledge in crucial counter Insurgency operations the Rhian Air Force ensured aerial Supremacy providing Vital Air Support reconnaissance and Casualty evacuation amplifying the operational scope of ground forces together these units and to enforce the established order in July 1964 the Ambush and killing of white foremen Andrew oberholzer by xanu insurgents sent shock waves through rhia's white Community the Smith Administration in rapid response detained key leaders from zanu and zapu including Joshua and KO and dingi sit hole and Robert Mugabe all sentenced to 10 years in prison despite their incarceration and the official Banning of both parties the military wings of zipra and zanla persisted operating from Exile in Zambia and later mosm Beek the gorillas escalated their activities into a full Insurgency initiating what would become a protracted Bush War following the unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 the conflict intensified throughout these embed Valley while embargos from Britain and the United Nations effectively shut off International contact with Smith's government in Salisbury despite these setbacks rhia was able to secure essential War supplies via South Africa Portugal and intricate smuggling operations that allowed for a degree of self-sufficiency early military engagements spanning April to September 1966 saw a slew of operations aimed at combating raids and the potential build of insurgence in the country 1967 to 1968 saw zipra and zanla respond by stepping up their campaigns with rodians in turn launching another tide of operations aimed at suppressing their activity some of these engagements like operation nickel and cauldron even involved outside intervention from Encanto we seway the paramilitary wing of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress together the these Guerilla factions sought to destabilize the control of security forces in the region win the local populaces Allegiance and carve out a base for impending operations all important steps toward dismantling white minority rule for their country in contrast Rhian Security Forces with crucial reinforcement from South Africa and Portuguese forces in mosm Beek aimed to quash the burgeoning threat and retain control over important territories the beginning of of the 1970s saw Insurgent forces continue to operate from secluded bases in regions sympathetic to Black Liberation these mainly included Zambia and areas of Portuguese mosm Beek controlled by Fimo or The Liberation Front Of mosm Beek whose own struggle mirrored events happening in rodesia Ian Smith's government was also keenly aware of the rising collaboration that the gorillas had with outside forces following a raid on mamb Beek's matim base in March 1972 the revelation of joint zanla for Lio infiltrations throughout T Province indicated zanu's growing threat what was once a ragtag group of revolutionaries had emerged into a serious Force thanks to assistance from Beijing meanwhile zapu was reeling from previous defeats within rodesia and seized active participation in the conflict as they focused instead on consolidating its position and sending militants abroad for extended training across Russia Cuba and North Korea this development was concerning for Smith who in December remarked the security situation is far more serious than it appears on the surface and if the man in the street could have access to the security information which I and my colleagues in government have then I think he would be a lot more worried than he is today 17 days later zanla forces led a daring attack on ala farm and in response Rhian Security Forces launched operation hurricane which targeted Guerilla bases and supply routes primarily in the northeastern region of the country this also marked the first of many major operations to come operation hurricane unfolded with a series of aerial bombardments ground assaults and intelligence gathering reconnaissance missions aimed at tracking gorilla movements while it achieved some success in mitigating gorilla threats it also underscored the Rhian forces inability to fully secure border areas thereby enabling ongoing Guerilla infiltrations and foreshadowing an escalation in violence for 3 years the conflict was largely contained to rhia's Northeast but the gorillas growing in determination experience and discipline used whatever means necessary to gain the upper hand in some cases this meant leveraging the influence of spirit mediums conducting child abductions for re-education and deploying landmines in Response Security Forces tried to counter this influence by imposing fines creating buffer zones manipulating friendly mediums and establishing protected Villages by 1974 conditions surrounding the bush War had shifted dramatically with the fall of Portuguese occupied mosm Beek and Angola rodesia found itself grappling with an additional 700 mes of border to defend and four more months of conflict a Seas fire initiated by South Africa inadvertently allowed gorillas to regroup while also prompting the release of detained nationalist leaders in 1975 South Africa withdrew its police from rodesia yet the war decelerated as zanu and zapu embroiled in internal conflicts targeted each other as much as they did sec Security Forces leaders were assassinated and zanla facing imprisonment of its leaders and an increasing reluctant Zambia shifted operations to mosm Beek rodesia enforced a Dusk to Dawn curfew along substantial portions of the mosambique and batswana borders by early 1976 zanla reinitiated conflict on multiple fronts focusing on vulnerable targets and evading direct confrontations to counteract escalating incursions on the the Eastern Highlands Security Forces launched operation Thrasher intensifying military engagements in the Strategic region with both Rhian and Guerilla forces adapting to the rugged terrain and evolving conflict Dynamics each vying for territorial control with mounting pressure from every direction Rhian security relied on the Armed Forces more than ever since 1974 the use of their fireforce military tactics saw airmobile and paratrooper infantry quickly responding to Guerilla sightings making use of air power to envelop insurgents wherever they cropped up still it wasn't enough to stem the tide and in some cases the fight had to be taken outside of national borders as was the case with the NAD zonia raid on August 19th 1976 codenamed operation Eland the raid on the neonia base in mosambique aimed to dismantle its importance as a logistics hub for zanla which housed approximately 5,000 personnel and a large Hospital led by 84 cellus Scouts under Captain Rob warer the operation involved a crossb raid into mosm Beek using vehicles and uniforms disguised as felo for infiltration Guided by former zanla Commander Morrison naath the Raiders entered the camp and upon a signal opened fire on the assembled gorillas while successful in dismantling the base this operation stirred controversy besides gorilla Fighters the camp also housed refugees including old people women and young children Amnesty International claimed that the operation killed 1,000 people while the political Fallout caused a strain in Rhian South African relations more importantly South Africa withdrew their Military Support which pushed Ian Smith to reconsider the principle of black majority rule in September by 1977 the country was divided into eight geographical operational areas while these were active Security Forces launched another crossborder operation on November 23rd operation dingo targeted the zanla headquarters near chimeo in mosm Beek the Rhian forces comprising 96 SAS 48 light infantry paratroopers and an additional 40 helicopter transported troopes or orchestrated a meticulously planned attack the operation commenced with a deceptive flyby from A Douglas DCA airliner which lulled zanla forces into a false sense of security following this the operation continued with air strikes from canara and Hunter aircraft as well as ground assaults and helicopter gunship engagements despite the strategical and tactical Precision notable zanla commanders including Josiah tongogara and Rex n go managed to escape due to an incomplete envelopment by the Rhian forces according to the Rhian combined Operation Center dingo claimed over 1200 zanla casualties it also sparked further controversy regarding civilian deaths and was later utilized in political narratives by the gorillas to showcase the brutality of Smith's regime the aftermath of operation dingo intertwined with complex political Dynamics including negotiations between Bishop AEL mua of the United African National Council and Ian Smith leading to a March 1978 Accord aimed at transitioning toward majority rule however this was denounced by Guerilla forces who saw the Accord as favoring white control while lacking any attempt to dismantle racial discrimination the subsequent years saw an escalation in the conflict with zanu under Robert Mugabe declaring 1978 as the year of the people and deploying at at least 13,000 zanla troops in Rhodesia by the end of 1978 all sides of the conflict had been mired in controversy the laying of extensive Mine Fields along with the use of biological and chemical weapons by Security Forces had given the gorillas further impetus to press their attacks however both zipra and zanla were often indiscriminate in their killing with continued raids on white farming communities along with in inous events like the Downing of Civilian Viscount planes by zipra militants or the horrific Elum Mission Massacre by zanla forces zapu and zanu pressed on their offensives with zanla aggressively expanding Westward while zipra responded by pushing East each faction vied for control over as many tribal lands as possible which led to skirmishes between zanla and zipra militants the entire central region of rodesia became a potential flasho threatening to escalate into a full-blown Civil War amidst this volatile backdrop the Rhian Security Forces struggled to neutralize this Brewing internal conflict in large part due to Manpower shortages attempts to alleviate this through foreign volunteers like the American crippled Eagles and French seven independent company had failed with issues of morale discipline and unit integration hindering rodian forces overall legislation to conscript black rodians was introduced in 1979 but few responded to the draft leaving the Armed Forces to rely on a meager pool of overworked Personnel meanwhile 1979 saw internal politics mired by failed agreements and the establishment of the short-lived state of Zimbabwe rodesia under its new prime minister Abel muua this government ultimately lacked International recognition due to its exclusion of key nationalist factions like zapu and zanu it was the Lancaster house agreement in 1979 which marked the true shift toward peace a compromise was forged leading to a ceasefire and a temporary reversion to British rule this symbolized the end of rodesia and the birth of Zimbabwe the subsequent 1980 election marred by allegations of voter intimidation and Military considerations of a coup saw Robert mugabi's Ascension to power Zimbabwe emerged From the Ashes

Germany's formidable adversary yet a direct confrontation was deemed feudal given Britain's Naval prowess geographical insulation and robust resupply channels falkenheim believed that sever ing the angl French Alliance could disillusion Britain and expedite the end of the war he surmised that a crushing blow to France at Verdun could be the Catalyst for a much needed breakup part of Falcon hine's attempts to reinforce his political power came in the appointment of Crown Prince vilhelm as the commander of the Fifth Army at Verdun while a novice in military command the 34-year-old vilhelm often seated decision making to his chief of staff under directives from his Royal father Falcon Hine hoped that this Dynamic would help intertwine Royal Prestige with military strategy further advancing his own position within the high seats of Imperial power the German attack was initially slated for February 12th 1916 but inclement weather delayed the offensive another 9 days when February 21st finally came the skies above ver D roared with German artillery over a million shells rained down in a Relentless 10-hour bombardment on French positions in the ensuing 3 days the Germans alternated between artillery showers and probing assaults on Villages north of the rfv methodically edging along the right Bank of the Muse the major push commenced on February 24th slicing through French defenses with alarming ease a grave oversight had left Fort duel Mal thinly manned its capture on the 25th by German forces was a bloodless Victory the night of February 26th saw Philipe pitan the stoic commander of the French second Army bestowed with the command of verdun's defenses it was a charge he accepted with Steely resolve keenly aware of the looming threat he orchestrated a reg garrisoning of the rf's remaining forts bolstering them with additional troops and essential supplies this strategic move was vital in Shoring up the defensive lines ensuring they were braced for any assaults by German forces while the German offensive on the right Bank was Swift and decisive the Left Bank posed a greater problem the difficult terrain of the Left Bank made the advances challenging and its lesser strategic value made every casualy feel more than hardfought in early March German forces managed to seize two villages in the Left Bank their focus then shifted to the elevated grounds on the Left Bank notably the formidable coat 304 and Lam or Dead Man's Hill within the leafy cover of baduas French heavy artillery took position their sight set on thwarting German advances toward coat 304 and the Dead Man's Hill as well as disrupting the German rear lines the toll of the battle began to mount with each passing in day the casualty numbers on both sides climbed steeply by the end of February despite the Grim tally neither the French nor the Germans were any closer to Victory heralding the protracted and bloody struggle that lay ahead the control of these two Hills seesawed between the French and the Germans throughout March and they became the initial staging grounds for a staunch French Resistance the defense orchestrated by General patan had roused Admiral ation among the French ranks however General Joffrey grew increasingly discontented with paton's Resolute focus on defense in a bid to shift the strategy Joffrey aimed to replace baton with a commander who echoed his own aggressive stance yet patan's burgeoning popularity proved a roadblock any abrupt removal risked political Fallout navigating this delicately Joffrey elevated pan to Commander of army group Center positioning Rober NL as the new commander of the second Army a move designed to distance patan from Verdun while appearing politically prudent on May 8th a stroke of Misfortune struck the German forces at Fort dual an accidental Munitions fire triggered a massive explosion claiming hundreds of German lives one speculation is that the blaze was ignited by soldiers attempting to heat coffee using flamethrowers but regardless if this story is true the explosion Rak Havoc plunging the German Garrison into disarray and damaging part of the fort seizing this unexpected opportunity French Commander Nel ordered an assault a meticulous plan was drawn up culminating in an ambitious attack on May 22nd preceding the assault between May 17th and the 21st French artillery Unleashed a barrage of 370 mm and 300 mm shells decimating numerous German defensive positions and Downing several observation balloons on the day of the French assault the 36th Infantry Regiment faced resistance on the Left Flank but the 129th regiment made a gallant Advance breaching the fort and occupying its Western half however their Triumph was fleeting German reinforcements swooped in isolating the 129th regiment and compelling a French retreat but The Saga of resilience continued at Fort V beginning June 2nd the fort endured a Relentless German Siege its Garrison dwindling in supplies and Men clung to survival major Silvan Eugen renal the fort's commander resorted to carrier pigeons for communication on June 4th amidst a dire Supply shortage he dispatched his last pigeon with a plea for resupply the bird albe it affected by poison gas valiantly delivered the message to Verdon Citadel earning the Legion of the honor and the moniker the brave relief arrived on June 5th yet the situation at Fort V remained Grim by June 7th with merely 12 gallons of drinkable water left for 600 men major renau had no choice but to surrender in a rare gesture of chivalry amidst The Savage conflict Crown Prince vilhelm honored Rena with a gifted sword despite V's capture a distant glimmer of Hope sparked on June 4th with the commencement of the Bruff offensive which eased the pressure on the Western Front though the resit was temporary on June 23rd German forces Unleashed a ferocious assault seizing ground before advancing toward Fort suil amidst the chaos roer Nel implored his troops with a resounding cry you will not let them pass my comrades a phrase that would later morph into the iconic battlecry they shall not pass the Relentless Onslaught at ferdan was momentarily eased as July ushered in the battle of the S requiring the redeployment of troops along different front lines by the end of August Romania's declaration of war against these Central Powers opened up a new front intensifying the already complex European conflict this was followed by a significant military reshuffle on August 29th when Falcon Hine weighed Down By The Quagmire at ferun was replaced by Paul Von Hindenberg as the chief of the German general staff Hindenburg with a fresh perspective shifted Focus to other theaters of War as he recognized the diminishing returns of the Verdun campaign he promptly ordered a halt to all offensive operations in the rfv marking a tactical re-evaluation hindenburg's strategic pivot aimed to better Al locate Germany's military resources seeking more favorable battlefields to change the war's trajectory which had been largely stagnant and draining meanwhile the French remained poised to reclaim the territory lost under Falcon Hines leadership in late October a determined French assault began with more than 700 guns pounding Fort damal into submission within a week thousands of shells had rained down rendering the fort's defenses nearly derelict Nel's creeping barrage tactics where artillery fire barely precedes a steady infantry Advance ensured the German defenses stood no chance by the time French troops stormed the fort on the 24th the Germans were already staging an evacuation leaving only a skeleton Force who yearned for reinforcements that would never arrive by the end of that day the French had captured over 6,000 prisoners and 15 artillery pieces the tale was not different at Fort V following devastating bombardments by French artillery the Germans were forced to evacuate after a French shell caused a huge explosion the French reasserted control over the fort shortly after allowing for a moment of symbolic recuperation among the long-drawn Bloodshed on December 14th leadership within the French army shifted from jafra to Nel marking a new phase this change came just before the second off ensive at fun orchestrated by generals patan Nel and commanded by General charl M on the morning of December 15th the calm was broken by the Roar of guns signaling the French Advance the preceding 6-day bombardment involving 827 guns and a total of 1,1 169,000 shells had turned the battlefield into a pockmarked crater artillery observation aircraft directed the final bombardment onto two German positions preparing the ground for infantry assault at 10:00 a.m. the French infantry moved forward shielded by a double creeping barrage of shrapnel and high explosive fire The Barrage was designed to keep German Defenders at Bay while French troops Advanced the attack was effective German defensive lines collapsed with many soldiers captured as the French infantry closed in accounting for over 13,500 German losses from the front divisions despite bad weather the the French troops reclaimed key positions lost earlier in February the rapid pace of their Advance left German Reserve units scrambling to respond by the night of the 16th and 17th new French lines were established extending Beyond damal and north of Fort Vu though nearly unrecognizable with damage French positions had been reclaimed once again the French not only recaptured key areas but also pushed the closest German position over 7 km back from Verdon claiming vital observation points the battle resulted in over 11,000 German prisoners and 115 guns captured boosting the morale of the French forces as they pressed further east as French troops continued their Advance through Villages north of the RF around December 18th the terrifying Siege of run began to lift the fields once filled with these sounds of gunfire and explosions started regaining a semblance of Peace the war tallies at Verdun were harrowing with over 350,000 casualties on both sides of which around 150,000 on both sides

tunnels or throughout holiday cargo unknown to many Viet Kong operatives disguised amid the revelers prepare for a stunning assault in the rain soaked Battlegrounds of kesan US Marines faced unexpected ambushes a harbinger of the chaos to come the night of January 29th approaches and the Tet celebrations bring on a year that Vietnam will never forget back in the mid 1960s South Vietnam grappled with intense political instability the assassination of President no Dean DM during the CIA backed coup in 1963 led to a a series of military hunas trying and failing to consolidate power widespread mistrust of these short lived governments allowed communist propaganda to gain traction among the South Vietnamese people the National Liberation Front better known as the Viet Kong was able to make use of North Vietnamese support to exploit this political vulnerability gaining power and influence meanwhile North Vietnam was progressing through a successful 5-year initiative to bolster its economy and defense capabilities as concerns over the spread of Communism grew during the Cold War the United States gradually expanded its military role in Vietnam initially focused on advisory and logistical support for South Vietnam's military direct American involvement increased with troop numbers reaching over 184,000 troops by the end of 1964 5 Napoleon once said an army

role North Vietnam adjusted its strategies and emphasized Unity Readiness and the need for modern Weaponry in its Communications to the Communist leadership the intensity of the conflict grew and by the end of 1967 the US had deployed over 485,000 troops to Vietnam in an effort to counteract the Viet Kong and North Vietnamese forces the US initiated a series of Search and Destroy missions this approach began in 1965 with the Ferocious Battle of the Yad drong Valley in the central Highlands marking the first use of air mobile Warfare by the US Army from 1966 to 1967 three successive operations were launched in binyong and tenin provinces which were recognized as key communist strongholds all the while North Vietnamese forces honed their Guerilla tactics and focused on strengthening and securing liberated regions demonstrating their goal to establish control and Garner local support during a meeting in July 1967 political and military leaders of the Communist High command met in Hanoi they realized that their current tactics had been focused on targeted periodic attacks and daily skirmishes all designed to unsettle their enemy and chip away at their confidence however this was not enough to turn the tide the increase of America's intervention in Vietnam forced the Communists to up the stakes for this new strategy against the South meticulous planning and coordination was required that would span several months the poot Bureau under leaders like Leon and Jang chin played a pivotal role in orchestrating this new offensive directed by the poot Bureau and the central military Party Committee representatives from the general staff were dispatched to battle zones around the country their mission was twofold assess the ongr situation and motivate local troops to prepare for intensified combat while stockpiling essential supplies the Bureau had set their sights on a significant victory in 1968 underscoring the need to directly confront and overpower US forces they devised a surprise assault targeting Urban hubs including Saigon Quay and daang with the goal of overwhelming both US troops and their South Vietnamese allies all these plans were shrouded in secrecy with North Vietnamese leaders undergoing specialized training sessions on Advanced military tax tactics besides the planning and coordination another crucial Insight came from the on the ground experiences of soldiers already in the field General VN zap proved invaluable for these preparations while General zap is often celebrated for his Triumph against the French at dmbn Fu the expertise he amassed between 1965 and 1967 was equally crucial during these years both the Viet Kong and People's Army of Vietnam fought extensively against American and South Vietnamese troops gaining important combat experience they recognized the protective advantage of underground tunnels against air strikes saw firsthand the success of Ambush strategies and understood the Strategic significance of the hoochi Min Trail for supply lines and troop movements under zap's seasoned leadership the North Vietnamese were well equipped and ready for the forthcoming offensive to help facilitate the constant need for better equipment and supplies North Vietnam looked to supplement its native production through continued support of communist allies which included China and the Soviet Union throughout 1967 the Soviets delivered a substantial number of aircraft radar sets artillery pieces air defense systems and thousands of Small Arms complemented by military training advisers China contributed similarly Furnishing the north with aircraft artillery tanks and a significant number of logistical supplies such as uniforms radios and vehicles this external support meant that the North Vietnamese were well-armed boasting a diverse Arsenal that included standard weapons like the SKS AK-47s rpg2 rocket launchers and even more substantial artillery despite this support the north still faced an enemy boasting Superior technology and Fire power to counter this a series of intricate tunnel networks were established all throughout the country communist Fighters were able to rest resupply and travel across multiple fronts without alerting the enemy these tunnels also provided storage and shelter protecting Fighters and their equipment from American Air power the logistical cunning of these tunnels was especially important for the new offensive troops and supplies coming off the hoochi Trail could be funneled directly into networks like Suchi where weapons could be stored troops staged and command centers established to help direct operations before the upcoming Attack One such operation began in January 1968 with the Battle of kesan during this time battalions of the US Marine Corps 26th Marine regiment faced ambushes from the paven 304th and 325c divisions the monsoon season provided a shield for pavin forces who used the heavy downpours to capture strategic points around the combat base even with prior intelligence the Marines under Colonel David E louns were caught off guard this early assault was made worse by a devastating explosion that ripped through the kesan combat base after its ammo dump was struck by pavin artillery fire with the Marines Under Siege and almost encircled American Air support under operation Niagara was intensified to Shield The Battered Marines this Fierce confrontation closely watched by the media foreshadowed the broader offensive looming on the horizon during tet windan or the Lunar New Year an expected ceasefire LED South Vietnam into complacency capitalizing on this Communists discreetly transported weapons into cities using trucks filled with festive Goods mourners hid arms in coffins and explosives nestled among Everyday Food the Viet Kong some disguised in Arvin uniforms blended with holiday crowds on the night of January 29th to the 30th 1968 leveraging the Tet celebrations they set the time for their widespread offensive against South Vietnam's Urban centers at 12:30 a.m. on January 30th the Viet Kong launched a coordinated assault on key Central Highland locations tan banat pleu and Kum these strategic cities were caught off guard with us and Arvin forces facing intense combat pleu saw the US fourth infantry and Arvin second division Under Siege while pmea and Kum witnessed Urban Warfare and pitched battles respectively n Jang housing the Arvin Airborne training center and the US Army's fifth Special Forces Group became a key Battlefield Queen nun the logistics hub for us and Aran forces confronted assaults from several North Vietnamese contingents deua and hoyan both vital transport hubs saw Fierce clashes as their primary Defenders Arvin units reinforced by local militias stood firm against the onslaught the fighting displaced many civilians especially those who had been relocated to counterinsurgency zones these areas established by the South Vietnamese government with us support Were Meant to isolate villagers from Viet Kong influence however these so-called strategic hamlets became untenable as battle raged and front lines shifted many civilians found themselves In Harm's Way and were forced to flee some sought Refugee in areas thought to be more secure While others embarked on a poignant Journey back to their ancestral homes often traversing War torn landscapes in search of safety and familiarity as Vietnam erupted into allout war both the People's Army and Viet Kong carried out attacks on key Urban centers across the South daang a crucial Port became a focal point for the central Highlands despite intelligence indicating a major assault defenses manned by the Arvin 51st regiment first US Marine units and the second Korean Marine Brigade faced challenges due to incomplete intelligence reports leading to underestimations and deployment delays as the offensive began Defenders confronted multiple attacks targeting vital sites amidst Fierce Urban combat US Marine expertise proved critical over time the combined American Korean and Arvin forces successfully repelled the assault regaining control over danang's strategic areas another key Target was Saigon South Vietnam's Capital North Vietnam's strategy dubbed the general Uprising aimed for both military gains and psychological impact the Brazen Viet Kong assault on the US Embassy on January 31st was a prime example of this psychological warfare Viet Kong sappers infiltrated the compound with a 6-hour battle ensuing before US forces regained control the city saw other major assaults including the presidential Palace and T sonot Airbase designed to challenge the South Vietnamese government's credibility although the embassy wasn't captured its breach deeply unsettled us command who feared for the possibility of further assaults throughout other cities meanwhile the historic city of H became a major Battleground the sixth paven regiment and vietcan forces mounted a coordinated attack capturing significant portions including the Imperial Citadel the subsequent battle was among the offensives fiercest the first Marine regiment alongside the first and third Arvin divisions faced challenging Urban Warfare against entrenched enemies within ha's ancient structures under General William West Morland us strategy saw their forces combating regular enemy units while Arvin divisions focused on pacification efforts in the surrounding area after 26 intense days us and Arvin forces finally reclaimed whe the city including many historical sites was left devastated post battle chilling accounts surfaced of mass executions by North Vietnamese and Viet Kong forces targeting suspected South Vietnamese allies fighting continued at Kon as pavin forces continued to wear away the spirits of the besieged Marines inspired by his strategy at dban fu General zap aimed for a total prolonged encirclement of the Americans the Marines at Kon combat base faced a battle of attrition enduring daily artillery attacks and sniper fire along with the usual assaults from pavin troops to combat this Marines patrolled aggressively engaging pavin forces in intense skirmishes General West Morland saw strategic value in the fighting at kesan for him kesan was a magnet that pulled paven forces away from populated zones potentially diluting the Ted offensive impact on other areas of the country that said he wasn't prepared to leave the Marines to zap's Mercy to bolster the encircled Marines operation Niagara continued to provide close combat support through American Air power and a vast aerial bombardment operation B52 Strat Fortress bombers working under operation arklite Unleashed massive payloads against communist assaults and fighter aircraft delivered critical air support that kept the Marines in fighting condition as well as blunting paven operations in the area though the Arvin was engaged predominantly in other tet Arenas its 37th ranger battalion was positioned at long v a nearby special forces camp this Camp faced a significant Challenge on February 7th when paven troops reinforced with pt7675 the marinees resilience both sides endured massive losses bombings dramatically altered kon's terrain rendering it into a crater filled Wasteland the suddenness of the Ted offensive exposed significant gaps in us and South Vietnamese intelligence based on optimistic evaluations and past successes us intelligence drastically underestimated the Communists boldness and potential especially during supposed truce times like the T holidays this oversight combined with an echo chamber effect Among Us commanders advising Arvin leaders magnified the shock the grand bull workk of America's alliance with South Vietnam was illusory what was meant to be an unbreakable Fortress holding the South together was instead riddled with silent cracks loyalties left in doubt from the South Vietnamese and outdated analogies from America's general staff these issues skewed perceptions of how the north might actually conduct their offensive which left the South Vietnamese and Americans reeling once the north finally pressed their attack the Ted attacks forced us leadership to reassess their understanding of the enemy's capabilities and intentions the Communists demonstrated not just their tactical strength but also strategic Insight that the US had overlooked as US forces rallied in response the arvit crucial role and resilience became evident though their vulnerabilities were also starkly highlighted whenever isolated or left without us support while the Viet Kong and pavin suffered immense tactical losses the ferocity of the offensive cast doubts on the US's ongoing approach by mid 1968 America had deployed 540,000 troops and spent $20 billion annually with the Air Force leading an unprecedented ground support campaign for over 3 years North Vietnam's surprise attacks during tet were mostly repelled within days with the US 7th Air Force playing a pivotal role the enemy's High casualties cost them a significant portion of the total troops engaged numbers very depending on sources but even the paven own conservative estimates put these casualties over [Music] 111,000 for the US the unexpected scale of the offensive eroded public confidence in the government's War strategy despite us and South Vietnamese forces repelling most attacks this changing sentiment catalyzed America's prolonged withdrawal from Vietnam which culminated in 1973 the cost of victory was steep with over 1,100 Americans and thousands of South Vietnamese soldiers wounded or killed in the initial weeks by March's end casualties included 1,000 American and over 2,000 Arvin and Allied deaths this highlighted concerns about the Saigon government's ability and arvin's ability to fend off future communist offensives without us support for North Vietnam the offensive was deemed a strategic success symbolizing their resilience and the notion that an unwavering desire for Independence couldn't be suppressed even by a superpower post tet US military strength in Vietnam underwent scrutiny realizing that sheer military strength might not dictate War outcomes still it came at a great cost with over a 100,000 dead soldiers and tens of thousands of Vietnamese civilians killed wounded or displaced over the course of 1968 the Ted offensive marked the biggest turning point for North Vietnam and its struggle against the South\",\n",
       " \" [Music] the Kingdom of Italy was roughly 61 years old when Benito musolini came to power the Italian people had yet to form a true national identity with a stronger sense of identification with and loyalty to one's immediate neighbors and church than to a distant government in Rome the disunified citizens of this young country were the clay from which Benito musolini intended to mold his new Roman Empire uch was determined to craft a fascist State reaching from Gibralter to the Parisian Gulf and in pursuit of his vision of Empire he set about a campaign of military adventures in the leadup to the second world war that expanded Italy's Imperial Holdings and advanced the fascist cause in Europe at their own expense looking back Italy was seen as the most immediate and natural Ally of Germany the two states were fascist by Design and were led by Firebrand dictators with grand Destinies for their people but that wasn't always the case despite Adolf Hitler's admiration for Italy's dictator Benito musolini the du's first impressions of the furer left much to be desired Italian General Petro bolio recalled a meeting in Venice between the two in May 1934 hit did not make a good impression on musolini he talked without stopping for an hour repeating in different words all the arguments from mine comp and only allowing musolini a few minutes in which to reply one might think that their ties could only worsen yet their relationship improved after the Allies hostile reaction to melini's campaign in Ethiopia Hitler gave musolini his implicit approval by sending his men much needed supplies which began a process of deant between the two Powers have you ever Googled yourself and were shocked to see your personal information Exposed on one of those public listing sites

to conquer Ethiopia believing that an imperialist success would unite the country behind him and provide Italy with access to the Sea unfettered by Foreign presence melini's Minister for colonies AO debono received official orders in February 1934 to prepare offensive plan and in December of that same year musolini publicly ordered the conquest of Ethiopia the timing seemed perfect as most European powers were distracted by Nazi Germany's rearmament however as it spent 1935 preparing for war the Italian military's shortcomings became clear Marshall Petro bolio head of the Italian High command visited the staging grounds in Italian erria and returned with a grim opinion Italy was completely unprepared for an offensive war and bolio further warned that a war in Ethiopia would prove a potentially fatal Financial strain bolio said as much in a meeting of the high command in September 1934 his warnings were met with absolute indifference an indication of the Discord amongst Italy's leadership Uche had long ago decided on invading Ethiopia which they did in October of 193 5 debono was put in charge of the invasion and found himself at the head of an army under strength men and material were in short supply and progress proved so slow that musolini replaced debono with bolio who remember had been Against The Invasion under bolio the Italians leveraged their Superior weaponry and Communications ability to improve the conditions on the ground but ultimately resorted to deploying mustard gas to overcome Ethiopian troops and pacify civilians these blatant violations of the Geneva Convention saw Italy placed under economic sanctions which served to drive domestic support for both musolini and The Invasion when civil war broke out in Spain in 1936 between left-wing Republicans and right-wing nationalists Uche unilaterally committed Italy to Francisco Franco's nationalist cause musolini intended to use intervention in Spain to cement fascist control over the Mediterranean with him and Franco casting Long Shadows over the region like Germany Italy sent the nationalists arms and men but here is where things take a turn so excited to support Franco was musolini that he had more than 70,000 Italian soldiers in Spain at the peak of his nation's involvement and at times had more aircraft in Spain than the Spaniards did consisting of 1/10th of the estimated numbers fighting for Francisco Franco fascists Italy had deployed more soldiers than any other nation in Spain on either side of the conflict the Italian loss of life was estimated to be around 4,000 soldiers musolini was exceptionally generous to his fascist Ally giving these Spaniards more than 600 planes 150 tanks 800 artillery pieces 10,000 machine guns and nearly a quar million rifles these were men and Machinery that Italy could ill afford to lose and and though the Spanish Civil War proved a valuable training ground for Italian troops the impact of the loss of material to Spain would last throughout the entire second world war with these pre-war conflicts and their effects on Italy understood we must now turn to the key reason Italy even had the opportunity to be ineffective in the second world war their relationship to Nazi Germany although they had a rock start to their relationship Hitler avered his belief that he and musolini shared the destiny of saving Europe from democracy and judeo bolshevism in 1936 the Axis powers were born with the signing of the Rome burlin axis United by fascism bitterness over the end of the first world war shared hatred of Communists Jews and other out groups as well as their determination to conquer both dictators prepared for for war against any who would oppose them concluding a military Alliance in 1939 this pact of Steel mandated that both Nazi Germany and fascist Italy go to war against Any Nation the other attacked and that they keep constant diplomatic contact to coordinate their efforts Hitler kept This Promise as well as he'd kept every vow he'd made to the world that is to say he didn't without informing his ally Hitler planned the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Poland even stressing to German High command the importance of attacking before musolini discovered their plans this subterfuge put musolini on edge leaving him worried that Germany might next begin asserting dominance in the Balkans which he regarded as falling within Italy's sphere of influence when Poland was invaded in 1939 Italy was in no position to fight alongside Germany musolini had confided in Hitler that Italy would not be ready to wage war until 1943 but musolini feared being absorbed by Germany if Italy did not take decisive military action and though his advisor stayed his hand at first the imminent fall of France in 1940 gave The Duce his opening thus Italy plunged head first into a war even the Bellos Duce knew she was completely unprepared for the leadership of Italy was not in basilic and knew that they had to quite ly pick their battles better to be the hyena following Germany's lion gorging themselves on Hitler's kills the shest bet in mid1 1940 was on Hitler next invading Great Britain and the Soviet Union remaining out of matters thanks to the molotov ribbon trop pack besides Hitler had promised to help the Italian economy fascist Italy's Achilles heel like their aess partner Japan Italy was reliant on Foreign imports of raw materials Imports that were all but cut off during wartime unlike Germany who had long prepared for wartime economic self-sufficiency and had a strong industrial base Italy was never prepared for a state of autarchy and lacked the industrial capabilities and raw materials to compensate for it before the war Italy imported 9 million tons of coal to supplement their 1.5 to 4 million tons of domestic production 2/3 of which was brought in by sea when Italy entered the war alongside Germany a British blockade did away with this Seaborn coal and Italy had to scramble to increase Overland Imports and domestic production Italy's access to oil was likewise hindered as their previous suppliers the United States Iran and the Soviet Union cut off their sales when war broke out Italy found itself reliant on Romania to supplement its meager domestic oil production but as the Eastern Front opened up in 1941 Germany monopolized Romania's oil and while Italy did have access to Mammoth stores of raw aluminum their issues in fuel and power generation prevented them from exploiting this key resource to its fullest potential Italy barely managed to produce a third of the aluminum that Germany did throughout the war the upshot of all of these troubles was a military apparatus without reliable access to fuel and an overtaxed industrial sector prone to utter paralysis it was already a tiny part of the world's industrial base representing 3% of global industrial output compared to Germany's 11% this minuscule industrial capability was divided between producing Goods for the domestic economy and producing weapons for the entire axis war effort Italy produced roughly 21% of axis tanks 25% of axis fighter aircraft and every type of combat ship needed by the axis for Seaborn operations Germany relied heavily on Italy to build out access convoys in the Mediterranean Italy a small industrial producer was called upon to not only outfit themselves but to provide additional material for their access Partners a proposition they were simply not prepared for compounding these issues were the aimless nature of the Italian war effort and the endemic Corruption of Italian business culture economic planners also completely rejected the idea of a streamlined production line or the standardization of Parts instead relying on isolated groups of skilled workers painstakingly handcrafting small batches of largely obsolete weapons at a cripplingly slow pace the problems in industrial production served only to further hinder Italy's ability to wage war these production issues were not isolated to Small Arms production however and were plainly evident in the nation's inability to both manufacture a suitable number of tanks and generate designs that compared in quality to both their Ally and their foes Italian armored forces compared particularly poorly in both Doctrine and equipment to their Allied counterparts one such example would be the inability of Italian Industries to produce enough welded or cast armor plating and the mountainous Italian terrain discouraged the development of heavily armored vehicles in the first place therefore the most commonly produced tracked vehicle in the Italian Army was the Carol fce cv33 tankette a tiny 2-an armored vehicle that could be equipped with machine guns anti-tank rifles light cannons or even flamethrowers on paper this was a versatile tank that could be easily built with Italy's limited industrial capacity and saw extensive use in Italy's Colonial territories in practice the cv33 was poetically named casad de morto or dead man's Box by its Crews who hated the flimsy armor and cramped in interior after the war Allied observers would comment that the individual components of many italian tanks were well engineered and reliable showcasing a solid grasp of the technology needed for a successful modern vehicle the problem was the total lack of cooperation between companies leading to new ideas being viewed with suspicion and international deals being intentionally sabotaged for fear of competition the single exception was found with the Italian Air Force course which successfully replaced their outdated air cooled engines with licensed diimler Ben's liquid cooled engines in 1940 newer Italian Fighters like the Machi c202 Folger were noted for their excellent handling characteristics and remained competitive until 1943 even after this point the reani company was able to produce Advanced aircraft like the re 2005 Sagitario which British Aces considered Superior to even the Spitfire and BF 109 the issue lay within numbers fewer than 60 sagitarios were ever produced as if comparatively subpar equipment were not bad enough these inefficiencies would be compounded by severely strained Logistics and inept decision-making on the part of Italian commanders who were frequently at odds with their leader and each other at the outbreak of war the rja marina the Italian Navy only had two battleships they had also not significantly Incorporated radar and sonar Technologies as the Royal Navy had done which left them effectively blind to enemy Approach at night or in poor weather this would become a significant factor in losses of several battles such as the Battle of Cape mapon where not a single Italian ship possessed radar capabilities a notably poor strategic decision was the failure to take advantage of their close position to one one of Britain's most geographically significant bases Malta Malta was the only Allied base between jalter and Alexandria and was not reinforced by the British due to their belief that they could not defend it from the Raa arotica the Italian Air Force in the wake of the battle of Tanto in November of 1940 when the Royal Navy disabled much of the Italian Fleet there Italian High command became reluctant to attempt an amphibious takeover of the islands and opted to rely entirely on the Raa aeronautica to bomb the Islanders into submission in March 1941 the raid on Cape mapan by the Royal Navy badly damaged the rja Marina's only operational modern Battleship and sank three Cruisers and two destroyers while receiving almost no damage in return hindered by the resistance of their commanders in the wake of taranto and mapan unwillingness to focus their efforts on Convoy Escorts a lack of cover from the Ria aeronautica and Perpetual fuel shortages the Ria Marina failed to take advantage of its potential to cut the Mediterranean in half and ensure access supply lines to North Africa in 1939 Italy launched a full-scale invasion of Albania swiftly establishing a protectorate and absorbing its territory into melini's new Italian Empire this maneuver was part of melini's broader strategy to strengthen Italy's presence in the Balkans countering Nazi Germany's expanding influence in Europe despite King zag I's initial resistance and subsequent Exile Italian forces led by General Alfredo gson efficiently secured Albania solidifying Italy's strategic position in the region on the eve of war in Europe melini's Ambitions extended beyond the European theater in East Africa it it Alan forces emboldened by earlier conquests in Ethiopia eyed British held territories the East African front became a critical stage where Italy aimed to expand its Empire by targeting Sudan Kenya and British Somali land this campaign spearheaded by Marshall Rodolfo graziani was seen as an opportunity to solidify Italy's Imperial presence in Africa however the challenging terrain and resilient Allied resistance posed significant obstacles this front Often overshadowed by the European battles was still a crucial aspect of Italy's war strategy against the British in many ways Italy's invasion of Greece was an attempt to imitate the expansionist policies of their German Ally up to this point Italy's only conquests had been in Ethiopia and Albania while Italian participation in the second world war had been limited to the French Alps and North Africa but musolini was a man of boundless ambition and had become convinced that the fastest method of securing dominance over the Mediterranean lay in the annexation of Greece from the outset Italian Logistics and maneuverability were compromised by the harsh climate of the pendis mountains combined with an unusually cold winter by December conditions were nearly Arctic foreshadowing what was in store for their German allies one year later pack animals quickly began dying of hypothermia and tens of thousands of men on both sides developed frostbite but these were not insurmountable obstacles and the Hardy Italians were no strangers to bad weather or rough terrain they also possessed a substantial number of Tanks modern infantry weapons and a strong air core in contrast the majority of Greek troops had to make do with a truly archaic Arsenal consisting mostly of equipment left over from the Great War furthermore the axis strangle hold over Europe cut them off from ships of ammunition or spare parts in terms of air power the only Force the Greeks could muster consisted of a mere 79 planes yet despite their advantages the Italians would soon find that the armor which had proved instrumental in the deserts of Ethiopia were useless in the pendis mountains meanwhile the air force that had terrorized the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War would be given a harsh lesson in humility by the British RAF which flew many sorties in defense of Greek airspace from the island of cre during The Invasion the British were also able to supply the Greeks with accurate and reliable Intelligence on enemy troop movements and strategic objectives thanks to having cracked Italian military encryption protocols the character of the Italian military establishment was also a major contributor to the disaster a culture of mistrust created bitter personal feuds in which generals were more concerned with humiliating each other than they were were with defeating the enemy interservice rivalries were just as severe with each branch cooperating as little as possible at of fear that doing so would undermine their own political relevance this was not helped by internal competition for the limited resources they had to work with as Italy was a largely agrarian country which unlike Germany did not have large occupied territories to plunder the these issues prevented the use of the combined arms tactics that their German allies had used so successfully in France and in Poland Italian generals were also astonishingly unwilling to consider new tactics preferring instead to believe that properly motivated and equipped infantry units could accomplish anything in sufficient numbers this attitude was highlighted when Italian observers compiled a detailed and insightful report on German tactics and handed it to Chief of Staff badolo only for him to promptly dismiss it with the words we'll study it when the war is over but contrary to popular perception the Italian Army was not wholly incompetent the issue did not lie with the morale or training of the average Soldier but instead lay in the systemic failures of the military establishment as a whole even Irwin raml noted that when given proper leadership the Italian troops under his command displayed incredible bravery but this quote from the war Diary of a disgruntled Italian General underlines the lack of foresight or strategic planning that went in to the campaign someone will say in 15 days we must be ready to March against Yugoslavia or in 8 days we will attack Greece from Albania as easily as saying let's have a cup of coffee The Duce hasn't the least idea of the differences between preparing war on flat terrain or in mountains in summer or in Winter still less does he work wor about the fact that we lack weapons ammunition equipment animals raw materials the factors we've discussed so far though important were not enough to guarantee an Italian failure that was guaranteed by the resolve displayed by the Greek people before the war Greece was a nation suffering from many internal divisions prime minister ianis maexus had been a veteran of the Great War who had taken to politics after becoming alarmed by the growing communist movement among the Greek peasantry but after failing to secure popular support maexus was appointed prime minister by the king of Greece George II shortly thereafter maexus used the threat of a communist Uprising to abolish Parliament and establish himself as an authoritarian dictator but despite the fact that his regime was deeply unpopular the Texas was a genius propagandist whose total control over the Greek media allowed him to spin a narrative of Italian cowardice and incompetence then on August 15th weeks before the declaration of war an Italian submarine torpedoed a Greek Light Cruiser this coincided with a major Festival to the Virgin Mary and the pious Greeks reacted by elevating the deceased crew to the status of religious Martyrs met Texas could not have wished for a more perfect opportunity and these State propaganda machines went into overdrive whipping the nation into a patriotic frenzy for the coming righteous conflict against the vile Italian oppressors the subsequent tenacity with which the Greeks resisted invasion was seen on numerous occasions such as the Battle of Hill 731 in which an entire Italian division supported by an armored element was repeatedly repulsed by a single Battalion of Greeks defending an important mountain pass this act of heroism has often been called the modern thermopolymerization [Music] for a month of sustained fighting in total at least 250,000 Greek reservists never even saw combat as their country lacked the means to provide them with so much as a pair of boots as the mainland collapsed the government withdrew to the island of cre one of the last targets of the German Balkan campaign British Greek and Anzac forces would be tested against over 20,000 airborne troops in the largest Airborne Invasion up to that point Hitler would go on to blame the invasions of Greece and Yugoslavia for the failure of operation Barbarosa allegedly stating if the Italians hadn't attacked Greece and needed our help the war would have taken a different course the North African front serves as a perfect Showcase of everything wrong with The Way fascist Italy ran its military operations the Italians invaded Egypt through Libya in September 1940 and experienced a catastrophic loss only a few months later during Britain's first large-scale military operation Operation Compass during operation Compass a commonwealth and free French Force numbering no more than 36,000 crushed the Italian 10th Army a combined Italian Libyan force of 150,000 presiding over this disaster was Marshall rodulfo graani formerly considered one of the best Italian generals but gratian's experience had been earned against Italy's many Colonial enemies and he was left totally out of his depth when confronted by a modern European Army despite a tremendous numerical Advantage graziani quickly recognized his largely non-mechanized Force could be easily outmaneuvered by the motorized British force and with his supply lines already overstretched he reluctantly decided to dig in and fortify at key defensible positions but these strong points were strung out and incapable of supporting each other so the British simply drove through the gaps and encircled them these tactics enabled the British to use their full force of 36,000 men 275 tanks 120 guns and 60 Armored Cars against one or two Italian positions at a time often finding themselves encircled Italian and Libyan troops surrendered in their thousands by the end of the operation the British had taken more than 138,000 prisoners hundreds of Tanks thousands of guns and numerous aircraft whilst sustaining a few losses by comparison the Italians fortunes were briefly reversed by Hitler who s the newly formed Africa Corp under Irwin raml to bail musolini out the German intervention and subsequent moment of Triumph before the axis was eventually driven back to Sicily served to further highlight the Italian deficiencies in both leadership and Logistics German forces comprised the minority of total forces throughout the entire North African camp cign showing that the insertion of capable German leadership played a key difference in the performance of the Italian Army tactical prowess and a few German panzers can't solve logistical issues however and so the North African campaign was in many ways doomed from the start while assisting raml in North Africa Italian forces also engaged in operation Barbarosa against the Soviet Union in 1941 initially joining the Eastern front as part of the Italian expeditionary Corp in Russia their role soon expanded into the larger Italian Army in Russia where they participated in significant battles including the Battle of Stalingrad and operations along the dawn River the Italians achieved some early successes alongside their German allies during the initial push but this was not to last harsh weather and fierce resistance inflicted heavy casualties with their involvement culminating in a disastrous retreat in 1943 especially after the encirclement of German forces in Stalingrad the severe losses and Retreats marked a major setback contributing to the broader axis defeat on the Eastern Front American generals naturally argued that an invasion of Italy at this time would draw resources away from Cross Channel operations into France something that the Soviets had been demanding for months debate raid Ed throughout the twoe conference at Casablanca with Churchill's stirring rhetoric about Italy being the soft underbelly of Europe eventually persuading the Americans to consider his proposal thus operation husky was born a large scale amphibious Invasion from North Africa to the island of Sicily which could be used as a springboard for a subsequent attack on Mainland Italy General Dwight D Eisenhower was appointed supreme commander of operation but planning remained primarily in the hands of British general Harold Alexander General Alexander's plan of attack was simple land on the southern tip of Sicily and capture the large Port of Syracuse then Drive North to cut off an axis retreat at Messina which was also a logistical staging point for any future invasion of Italy the British would take center stage in the assault with the American forces operating in a supporting role something they weren't particularly happy about to reach Syracuse the Allies would need to cross the pon Grande bridge over the river anapo but given its strategic importance the Italians undoubtedly prepared to destroy the bridge at first sign of invasion left with no other options General Alexander authorized a risky Airborne operation to capture the bridge ahead of the main Invasion on the night of July 9th 1943 a large formation of gliders and transport planes entered axis airspace over the aisle of Sicily but with winds gustl at over 45 M or 72 km an hour the ambitious Airborne assault quickly turned into a confused mess anti-aircraft batteries and search lights added to the chaos leading to 65 of the 147 gliders being released prematurely by their Towing aircraft many of which plunged straight into to the ocean of the remainder only 12 landed near their objectives and the rest were scattered far and wide across the Sicilian Countryside had the axis forces been better prepared operation husky might now be considered one of the biggest disasters of the second world war but many factors transpired to give the Allies an easier time than they arguably deserved Sicily was defended by the entire Italian 6th Army backed up by several German divisions amounting to over 300,000 men accompanied by several hundred tanks and over 1,000 aircraft but Italian morale was at an all-time low following the loss of North Africa and the bulk of the sixth Army was made up of coastal and support divisions that had minimal combat experience and little incentive to stand and fight furthermore senior Italian General Alfredo guani and German field Marshal Albert Kastle ring were constantly at odds over every detail of the defense thanks to this bickering and the loss of North Africa the remaining German soldiers in Sicily had grown to despise their Italian counterparts and now refused to coordinate with them the tentative nature of the axis hold on Sicily was plainly Illustrated when a ragged group of 50 British paratroopers made their way to Pon Grande Bridge after scrounging up a meager handful of supplies with no expectations of success the men fired off a few half-hearted valys at the entrenched Defender only to watch in astonishment as the terrified Italians leapt from their bunkers and vanished into the night scenes like this were repeated across the island with paratroopers causing Havoc by cutting telephone wires intercepting message couriers and attacking isolated Coastal batteries as the next day dawned a fleet of transport ships made a daring rush through high seas towards the Sicilian Coastline lining their decks were the men of the US 7th Army under George Patton and the British eth army under Bernard Montgomery once again the treacherous winds and natural obstacles such as offshore sand bars were as dangerous as enemy fire with several Landing ships running around or finding themselves blown helplessly off course however as previously stated enemy resistance was remarkably light with no significant Force awaiting the Allies on the beaches with no tanks or mobile infantry divisions to contest The Landings The static defenses proved only temporary inconveniences when the confused dispirited Italian forces finally began to mobilize for a Counterattack on the beach heads they were easily repulsed by Naval gunfire with approximately 53,000 men put ashore in the first wave the Allies began their Advance Inland although Pote Grande Bridge had already been recaptured by the Italians the paratroopers held it long enough to delay the axis forces to destroy it and Syracuse fell within a day by the 12th much of Southern Sicily was in Allied hands the loffa was was being suppressed by strategic bombing raids and many Allied officers were already preparing to celebrate a swift Victory but then disaster almost struck when the British attempted a second major Airborne operation to capture a bridge over the river cimo which blocked their Northern Advance towards the city of katania while the initial attack was successful the bridge was deep Behind Enemy Lines and the isolated paratroopers had to hold out for three whole days before ground units could relieve them even after the bridge was secured Fierce Italian Resistance stalled the advance into the northern half of the island for another week Sicily would not be an easy Victory after all with delays mounting friction developed between the two halves of the invasion Force the American 7th Army had been intended to provide support from the flanks but was otherwise expected to hang back while the British eighth Army did most of the fighting to say this situation was not to General Patton's liking would be a vast understatement so he began badgering General Alexander for permission to break out to the western side of the island unable to endure Patton's pestering Alexander reluctantly mumbled that Patton could conduct a limited reconnaissance mission naturally Patton interpreted this as permission to charge the entire seventh Army West at break neck speed leaving Montgomery to continue trudging North in the face of increasingly stiff enemy [Music] resistance while Patton was busy crushing the remnants of the Italian Army stationed in Western Sicily field Marshall Kastle ring Was preparing his final defensive line in the mountainous terrain south of mesina this was known as the Etna line as it included the giant volcano Mount Etna as one of its key defensive components both sides knew that whoever controlled the mountain slopes could decide the course of the battle and fighting in the area was intense Montgomery planned to capture the town of adrano which linked the two halves of the etal line together around the base of the volcano but adreno was still well Behind Enemy Lines and to get there the Allies had to battle their way through some of the harshest terrains since the deserts of North Africa the first major Clash on the road to Mount Etna occurred at the town of Chen tpe situated at top a line of extremely steep hills that gave a commanding view of the surrounding Countryside and provided a nearly impregnable defensive position for the elite German foser or paratrooper regiment station there on August 2nd a heavy artillery barrage managed to destroy or dislodge The Defenders from several of their Hilltop fortifications but Chen to repay itself remained defiant left with no other choice the men of the British 78th Infantry Division pushed forwards across broken Rocky terrain constantly being hit by mortar fire and German snipers entering the town The Battered infantrymen found themselves confronted by a pair of Panzer 3es that had been hidden in the narrow streets with no armored support of their own the men of the 78 played hide and seek with these deadly opponents finally surrounding and destroying them with peat anti-tank weapons yet even without their tanks the outnumbered falam jagers held out for two whole days as the British were sweating up the steep hills around shent tpe General Patton had finished rolling up the Western half of Sicily and was now assaulting the town of Trona which was also part of the eoline once again the extreme terrain made for a iCal Advance with extensive minefields making the unsteady ground even more treacherous to Patton's great annoyance his forces were unable to achieve any easy breakthroughs and had to settle into an arduous routine of slowly prying the enemy off their fortified hilltops one by one the German and Italian forces were not content to Simply Hold the Line either launching numerous counterattacks that often managed to regain ground and reoccupy old positions The Assault on Trona lasted until August 6th and just like chent tpe the Allies were unable to prevent the Germans from making an orderly withdrawal that same day Ado was occupied by the 78th Division and just like that the etol line was finally broken and the end of the campaign was in sight in fact axis forces were already in the process of evacuating from Sicily Castle ring was under no Illusions about his chances of holding the island for much longer and had little reason to stand in fight after the loss of katania and its airfields on the fth beginning on August 11th a massive Fleet of transport ships assembled at the Port of mesina right at the northern tip of Sicily with rear guard units delaying the Allied Advance more than 100,000 German and Italian soldiers were able to cross the Straits of mesina and Escape into [Music] Italy it is late January 1944 and just south of Mont Casino the men of the 36th Infantry Division are attempting to secure a bridge head over the gari river enemy fire is intense with German artillery saturating the area in a Relentless deafening barrage despite enormous losses two regiments have made the crossing but now they are trapped their landing craft reduced to splinters by the ceaseless bombardment back on the opposite Shore Major General Fred Walker watches the disaster unfold through his binoculars a veteran of the Great War he knows an impossible situation when he sees one glancing backwards at the one remaining regiment under his command he debates ordering them forward but after a moment he dismisses the idea even if a miracle happens and this river is taken the cycle will just repeat at the next one sighing to himself he wonders how anyone could have been foolish enough to Envision Italy as the soft underbelly of Europe with this game of chess between Italy and the Allies seemingly coming to a conclusion after the abrupt realization that musolini only really knew how to play checkers a single handshake would end the game before it reached the Italian Countryside but no such handshake would happen as 16 new German divisions crossed the Alps into Northern Italy spoiling for a rematch but the Allies were not deterred as far in the East Joseph Stalin remained insistent that the Allies maintain pressure on the Western Front and divert as many axis forces as possible away from the Soviet Union thus the second match began on September 3rd when soldiers of the British 8th Army dashed Across The Straits of mesina this was intended as a diversion from the real Landings scheduled to take place a week later but Albert Kastle Ring The General enal in charge of the German troops stationed in Italy was no fool and simply ordered the men stationed in the area to retreat and consolidate their positions further north denied battle the frustrated British Advanced at a snail's pace delayed by minefields roadblocks and collapsed Bridges a few days later a second British operation took place this time aimed at taking the port of taranto and establishing a supply base for the eth Army again the initial Landings went unopposed as British forces established control over the south of the country news of the Italian surrender was made public and the situation promptly took a turn for the worse on Hitler's orders German forces undertook operation oxa quickly disarming the remainder of the Italian military while a few divisions chose to resist the majority either meekly surrendered or agreed to fight alongside their new occupiers the new Italian government fled Rome which was occupied on the 10th and musolini found himself self thrust back into the international Spotlight at the head of a new puppet state the Italian socialist republic with Italy controlled by Nazi Germany there was no hope of a swift Victory and the stage was set for the prolonged bloody conflict that would follow despite this setback many Allied planners remained optimistic holding on to the dream of a lightning campaign to liberate the peninsula the minimal resistance encountered by the British led to the belief that the Germans were still preoccupied dealing with the Italian Army and lack either the will or the manpower to defend territory south of Rome so on the 9th of September the Allies commenced operation Avalanche with a total of nine divisions from the US Fifth Army launching from staging points on Sicily and heading straight for a roughly 35 M or 56 km stretch of Italian Coastline near the port of solo at this point in time the Fifth Army was a combined force of both British and American troops the for former were to land in the North near Salo itself while the latter were directed further south from the start The Landings were severely mismanaged with historians arguing to this day over who deserves the most blame for the ensuing Fiasco despite strenuous protests from the leader of the naval task force Admiral Kent huitt the American Landing zones were not subjected to a preliminary bombardment this was due to the mistaken assumption that the operation had the element of surprise despite sightings of luk GAA reconnaissance planes over the task force as it crossed from Sicily predictably kessle ring had guessed the American plan of action and positioned his troops to contest The Landings left with no alternative the men of the Fifth Army waited ashore under intense bombardment from machine guns field artillery and panzers the beaches quickly turned into a slaughterhouse and for a brief moment the fate of the entire campaign hung in the balance then the guns of the naval task force finally opened up blasting gaps in the temporary German fortifications and opening the way for the baguer troops to rush through and establish a beach [Music] head but this was by no means an end to the Carnage as the entire 16th Panzer Division then thundered down from the hills to continue the onslaught during the Frantic fighting that ensued Naval gunfire again proved decisive with the cruiser and Destroyer escorts engaging a minimum of 130 Shore bound targets during the first day alone further north the British divisions had faced somewhat lighter resistance and had only gone ashore after their escort ships had spent 15 minutes softening up the German defenses after pushing Inland they were able to capture a vital Airfield and a force of SAS Commandos and US army rangers entered Salo itself and drove out the Defenders after a brief bout of Street Fighting but the situation was still dire and German counterattacks were Relentless the LOF vafa also conducted many sorties against both the beach heads and the naval task force sinking approximately 100 landing craft of various sizes and damaging various warships after another 6 days Kastle ring was forced to retreat on direct orders from high command Hitler had conferred with Irwin raml and both men had agreed it was pointless to try and defend southern Italy although they had very nearly succeeded in throwing the Fifth Army back into the sea German losses had been heavy especially among the precious Panzer divisions but these losses were not crippling and the rough Italian Countryside presented many opportunities for the Germans to make life hell for the Allies as they pushed up the peninsula having been battered almost to the point of breaking the weary men of the Fifth Army were reluctant to Drive North after their retreating enemies morale was extremely low and as a result the decision was made to delay the push on Rome until October in the meantime Allied Forces concentrated on consolidating their hold on Southern Italy and capturing the airfields located on the companion Plains while this was ongoing the civilian population of Naples Rose in an unexpected Revolt creating enough chaos for the Allies to force a German Retreat from the area on October 3rd the SAS conducted a daring amphibious assault on the city of of termoli part of the first defensive line south of Rome this was known as the Volo line and ran parallel to two large rivers The Raid was a remarkable success with the Commando team seizing the city and holding it until being reinforced by the Commonwealth eth Army however the river Crossings were delayed by the need to build Bridges capable of withstanding the weight of Allied tanks as the engineers got to work the 16th Panzer Division struck again further impeding Construction efforts and inflicting significant casualties but the two Allied armies pressed on reaching the second line of German defenses in late October known as the Barbara line once again the rough terrain proved as big an obstacle as enemy fire and it was only on the 9th of November that a significant breakthrough was finally made Bonito melini's mishandling of the war had turned the majority of his political party against him though holding near total Authority as prime minister musolini was technically subordinate to the reigning king of Italy Victor Emanuel III who could remove him from office at any time but Victor Emanuel was a notoriously cautious Monarch and had deliberately fostered the fascist regime in Italy to preserve his own authority it was not until shortly after the fall of Sicily that opposition forces dared to approach the king and it took multiple assurances from president of the chamber of fasis and corporations count Dino grandi before he agreed to back Marshall patro bolio as the next prime minister of Italy Emmanuel was desperate to cling to power and viewed bolio as an easily manipulated underling who could be relied on to help him reassert his authority over Italy and negotiate a favorable ceasefire with the Allies but even with Victor emanuel's backing grandi knew that a dangerous struggle lay ahead as several other members of the grand Council were still Ardent fascists who remained committed to the war effort on July the 24th the members of the grand Council of fascism met in The Palazo venetsia to decide the fate of their Nation outside smoke still Rose from ruined factories and Basilica of St Lawrence devastated by Allied bombing raids just 5 days prior the mood was exceptional tense with Dino grandi going so far as to conceal a pair of hand grenades under his jacket in case violence broke out though armed black shirts surrounded the building Benito musolini entered without his personal bodyguard and immediately launched into a furious defense of his own actions grandi replied with a speech that besieged the king to resume control over the nation and concluded with a vicious jab at The Duce himself let perish all actions so that the nation can live arguments raged back and forth throughout the evening as the various fascist members of the council Rose to argue their points with the supporters of the King after 9 hours the council was split over several ordina deljo or orders of the day each outlining a radically different course for the nation to break up this confused tangle of conflicting interests grandi demanded the unthinkable and actual ual vote the first to take place in the entire 15-year history of the council to his immeasurable relief Grand's order of the day carried a majority and a broken musolini was forced to deliver it to the king in person the next day Victor Emanuel then ordered his arrest and informed bolio that he was the new prime minister within hours huge crowds were swarming through the streets of all major Italian cities defacing statues chipping off mural and making bonfires out of former fascist regalia the grand Council would disband itself shortly thereafter bringing Italy's 21-year-old fascist regime to a stunningly abrupt and ignominious end unfortunately this extraordinary political upheaval left many unanswered questions most prominent of which was what exactly to do about the eight German divisions that began advancing into Northern Italy on the day of melini's arrest King Victor Emanuel was still backing a highly authoritarian government ruling under martial law and his pleas for assurances of Allied support for the monarchy delayed the opening negotiations to take Italy out of the war for 45 days the government struggled to assemble a coherent agenda while the king relapsed into passivity in the end bolio arranged secret talks with the allies in the Armistice of cibele which assigned Italy the role of co-belligerent against Germany but the Allies refused to alter their existing timetable for the invasion of Italy and bolio was unable to arrange a defense of the nation before being forced to publicly announce the Armistice in response case axis was devised as an operation to disarm the Italian military and set up a puppet regime in Northern Italy on September 9th with German troops racing toward the capital bolio Victor Emanuel and most of their government fled South into the waiting arms of the Allies the subsequent power vacuum in Rome allowed numerous opposition parties to emerge from hiding including the Christian democrats the Socialists and the Communists who quickly founded the committee of National Liberation or cln September 9th was also the starting date for operation Avalanche a massive amphibious landing at Salo by the US Fifth Army their goal was the capture of Naples which had already been heavily damaged by Allied bombing campaigns social order had almost entirely broken down thanks to the widespread arrest and Detention of the Carabiner or Italian police forces who had been deemed a monarchist threat by the German occupation on the 12th Colonel Walter scha took command of Naples and declared that up to 100 citizens would be executed for every German life lost scha then ordered 240 neopolitan living near the coastline to evacuate making it clear he planned to demolish the entire Port District to deny it to the attackers this was accompanied by a declaration that all Italian males aged between 18 and 30 would be conscripted for forced labor and a day later SCH dispatched troops to round up as many men as possible this caused huge crowds of mostly unarmed neapolitans to burst out onto the streets their ranks augmented by a few soldiers who had managed to escape detention The Following chaos would be known as the four days of Naples with uncoordinated but highly motivated groups of partisans striking at the occupiers in any way they could on the third day the part gained the upper hand after corralling Colonel scha inside the City Stadium where he was forced to negotiate for the release of Italian prisoners housed there a day later the German Garrison began to pull out of the city leaving the partisans battered but Victorious and the vital Port facilities intact for Allied usage while the people of Naples made their stand major events had been taking place further north after his arrest musolini had been contained in the heavily guarded graso mountain complex the question of what to do with the former Duce was solved for the Allies on September 12th when German special operative OT soreni rescued musolini from captivity and spirited him North to become the prime minister of the new Italian social Republic also known as the Republic of C or RSI but melini's failures had hardly left him in good standing with Adolf Hitler and his new fascist regime was all but completely subordinate to its Nazi counterpart with Germany seizing the Italian gold reserve and allowing the RSI only a token military force musolini however was allowed to recreate his personal militia who would quickly come to be known as the brigate ner or black brigades formed expressly to suppress partisan activity the black brigades would operate closely with the German military and assist in many massacres of Italian Ian civilians but news of these war crimes would strengthen the resolve of the Italian citizenry to resist the RSI and melini's first conscription campaigns drove thousands of middleclass Italians to flee into the mountains and take up arms against the fascist puppet government these initial Guerilla bands were primarily composed of Communists augmented by deserters or Italian soldiers who had managed to keep hold of their weapons weapons some were also outright Bandits who terrorized the local peasantry for personal enrichment the situation was made worse by constant Allied bombing campaigns focused primarily on the three industrial cities of Turin Milan and Genoa in March of 1944 several 100,000 Italian workers in Milan went on strike pleading with the RSI to stop making their Nation a Target by supplying weapons to Germany of course musolini rejected these demands and the protest was suppressed with thousands sent to German labor camps this was the last straw for many Italians and thousands began flocking to the banner of the cln in an effort to reassert dominance the Germans would retaliate by slaughtering 335 Italians in the rtina massacre a few months later German soldiers and black Brigade members surrounded the village of St Ana d stsa none of the villagers had been directly implicated in a partisan attack but the Germans executed 560 of them anyway in an effort to terrorize the rest of the populace into submission but far from Co the partisans the brutality of the RSI and its allies only encouraged more overt resistance as between the end of 1943 and summer of 1944 partisan membership exploded from fewer than 9,000 to well over 30,000 with winter rapidly closing in the Allies had little time to prepare for their assaults on Castle Ring's Masterpiece an innovator in both military tactics and apparently chess the Gambit we've named after the German general includes distracting your opponent and quickly switching out all of your pawns for castles on the 1st of December the first probing attacks began in the west made against a large bulge in the German defenses known as The Baron heart line L conditions were terrible with freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall making for an agonizing Trek for the soldiers as they struggled their way through hostile terrain after several weeks of intermittent engagements the Allies were only able to wrestle a number of small villages away from enemy control in the end it was the Germans who decided to withdraw falling back to the more tenable Gustav line in early January of 1944 while the Fifth Army was busy dying in the snow the eighth Army also found itself preoccupied with well dying in the snow the ath had attacked the Gustav line on the 4th of December and made significant Headway but then the Germans made a strategic withdrawal through a deep Gully which funnel the Commonwealth forces into a carefully prepared killing ground any unit entering the gulie was brutally mauled and Allied progress was completely stalled until German forces withdrew to a new position on the 20th the next set of battles for the Gustav line took place at at the towns of ortona and oronia the former proved an absolute nightmare for the Canadian units assigned to capture it as they were forced to engage in some of the bloodiest street fighting on the Western Front the German parachute Battalion defending the town had dug in deep and had to be fought from building to building in a protracted struggle that resulted in roughly 4,500 casualties altogether decimating both the first Canadian division as well as the civilian population oronia meanwhile resisted every attack holding out until a massive blizzard struck the Adriatic Coastline and forced the British to Halt their offensive but even this could not end the Bloodshed for long and on January 14th the two Allied armies launched yet another series of attacks on the line starting the notorious battle for Monte Casino the first assault was conducted by the British and resulted in little more than 3 days of pointless Slaughter two more attacks failed due to to either terrain or a lack of armored support and a fourth ended with minor gains that were promptly abandoned due to the lack of supplies after these repeated failures the Allies authorized operation Avenger which fixated on the Monte Casino Abbey as the Lynch pin of German defenses in the area on February 15th a huge bomber raid reduced the Abbey to a smoldering pile of rubble unfortunately the raid was badly coordinated and was not followed up by a ground assault so in the end little was accomplished while this was ongoing the Allies had also conducted a naval landing near the city of ano to outflank the Gustav line but after landing relatively unopposed General John P Lucas made the inexplicable decision to dig in and fortify his position rather than push Inland kessle ring promptly wheeled his reserves about and smashed into the beach head beginning a long Battle of attrition that would last until May meanwhile the third battle for Casino began on March 15th with a creeping barrage that disordered the German line but this Ray of Hope was quickly snuffed out by heavy rains giving the Germans time to prepare however by now it was clear that the axis was losing the battle of attrition and the final breakthrough came on May 11th when both the eighth and fifth armies attacked at once aided by the French expeditionary Corps and even some Polish forces this last tremendous push finally fractured the Gustaf line which held for nearly 6 months but although the main line of axis defenses had been breached there was still much to be done and the push North continued a breakout was also staged at anio with the help of an artillery bombardment and close air support in danger of becoming encircled Castle ring received orders to fall back but right at the pivotal moment General Mark Clark decided to ignore orders to pursue the German Army and instead drove towards Rome unable to believe his luck a delighted Castle rang quickly pulled back to yet another another set of defensive works codenamed the gothic line after so much blood had been shed the actual capture of Rome was something of an anticlimax with German attention turning towards the inevitable invasion of France the city had all but been abandoned after a few brief skirmishes Rome was liberated on June 4th just 2 days prior to The Landings in Normandy getting there had required 600,000 Allied troops over 100,000 of which had become casualties since the day they first landed in Italy but despite their Grievous losses there was little time to rest and recuperate kessle ring had proven a genius at defensive Warfare and leaving him to his own devices would undoubtedly prove disastrous thus British and American armies raced up the coast only to be checked yet again at the improvised try meni line encountered on on June 20th stalled for another week the Germans had ample time to move the bulk of its Army to the appenine mountains infuriated but impotent the Allies could do nothing but resign themselves to yet another long grinding Siege on August 25th the Allies launched operation Olive aimed at breaching the gothic line and finally ending the seemingly eternal battle for Italy the eighth Army was to attack German positions along the Adriatic coast and when Castle ring had committed his reserves to that area Mark Clark's Fifth Army would strike at the weakened Center breaking through to bolognia initial progress was good but Castle ring continued to pull his old tricks and refused to be lured into fighting on unequal terms by the end of September the Allies had clambered their way over the peaks of the appenine mountains having suffered 14,000 casualties then Autumn rains stalled further attacks grounding air support and turning vital supply routes into to impassible quag Meyers at this point the remainder of 1944 would be spent in a deadlock with a single axis counter attack in December managing to briefly reoccupy a section of the gothic line although Castle ring had done a spectacular job in Italy his position was about to change drastically he was severely injured in a car crash in October and upon his recovery found himself replacing field Marshall gett Von runat as commander of the entire Western Front on March 10th even he could do nothing but watch the final collapse of the Third Reich as Allied troops were already pouring into Germany itself in Spring of 1945 the Allies launched their final offensive in Italy operation grapes shot during the months long stalemate the fifth and eighth armies had been reinforced by a diverse collection of units from various Nations including several thousand British trained Italian volunteers and even a division from the Brazilian expeditionary Force the attack began on April 6th with a long artillery bombardment then attacks all along the line by Commonwealth troops without any reserves left the Germans could no longer do anything but desperately try to hold the line however the situation was Hopeless by the 20th of April the two Allied armies had broken into the po valley and only 5 days later musolini was dragged out of hiding by Italian partisans and summarily executed with no reason left to fight Castle Ring's replacement opened up negotiations with the allies and signed a surrender order on May 2nd just a few days before the official end of the war in Europe after so many gambits and clever plays the chess board of Italy had been cleared the final handshake between players would occur at last a year and a half after the start of their unexpected rematch in many ways the Italian campaign showcased both the best and worst moments from the second world war the idea to divert forces from the Eastern Front was sound but internal division quickly turned the campaign into an unfocused mess supplies were diverted to other operations and arguments among Allied generals led to missed opportunities and long delays kessle ring also demonstrated exactly how deadly the vermos could be on the defense Holding Out for over a year against a much greater force which by that point possessed total air superiority but the battles in Italy kept hundreds of thousands of German soldiers occupied at a time when Manpower was critically low and the experience gained from the amphibious Landings at salarno proved invaluable to the planners of D-Day still historians remained divided on the campaign with many arguing that it was an outright strategic failure but others see it as part of a bigger picture a necessary even vital component to the fall of the Axis powers into the liberation of Europe\",\n",
       " \" the end of the Ottoman Empire following the first world war left a vacuum of power in the Levant here in this former ottoman region was the land of Palestine settled by a diverse population of Christians Muslims and Jews alike the power vacuum was quickly filled by France and Great Britain who secretly drafted the Sykes Pico agreement of 1916 which proposed to divide the ottoman territories between the two powers this contradicted the earlier McMahon Hussein correspondence between 1915 to 1916 which stated that the area of Palestine along with all of the Arabian Peninsula would become part of a new pan Arab Nation should the Arabs agree to help Britain defeat the Ottomans while this occurred the influential Zionist organization had their own designs in the area at the Paris peace Conference of 1919 the zionists led by ham wisman proposed that a Jewish homeland be established in the Palestinian territory their proposed borders included what would become present day Israel Western Jordan Southwestern Syria and Southern Lebanon no representation was afforded to the Arabs or Palestinians residing in the territory during these discussions for the zionists the settlement of Palestine was not a colonial Venture but instead a return from exile to the land of Israel their ancient Homeland for the Palestinians however this distinction seemed to matter little as Jewish immigrants began to arrive and steadily dispossess many Palestinians from their homes despite these concerns these zionists appeared to have the upper hand thanks to the implicit approval of the British government the most telling example of this support for Jewish settlement in Palestine occurred in 1917 when British foreign secretary Arthur Baler sent a declaration of support to Lord Walter Rothschild a banker politician and prominent Zionist leader the nature of the Baler declaration would become public on November 9th of that year when it was published in the British press ultimately the final decision regarding Palestine was a blend of Zionist aspirations and British geopolitical interests Britain's strategic AIMS in neighboring Egypt especially around the Suez Canal aligned with the Zionist vision for a Jewish homeland this shared Vision led to the creation of the British controlled mandatory Palestine which encompassed the territories of modern-day Israel the West Bank and Gaza as the years under British governance rolled on Discord between the Jewish and Arab communities soon broke out with each side nurturing National aspirations that often clashed the bow for Declaration of 1917 continued to fuel Zionist immigration and land purchases exacerbating tensions with the indigenous Arab population in 1936 these tensions exploded with the Arab revolt against both the British mandate and Jewish immigrants settling in the region in an attempt to quell the unrest the British proposed several Solutions including the partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states the proposed borders gave the Jewish State about 1/3 of Palestine including the Galilee the Jezreel Valley and the coastal plain while the Arab State received Judea Samaria and the Negev Desert however the plan was met with mixed reactions the Jewish Community was divided but more inclined toward acceptance while Arab leaders denounced The Proposal refusing the idea of land partition and population transfer while the seeds for the Israeli Palestinian conflict were planted in the aftermath of the first world war the recent violence is the result of Decades of deep mistrust TR and animosity between both sides creating an objective documentary on the history behind these events is a daunting task for creators who want to convey the facts

thank you to ground news for making this video possible in the shadow of these failed proposals extremist factions emerged fueled by deep-seated grievances Jewish groups like The Aron and Stern gang orchestrated terrorist attacks against British and Arab targets aiming to expedite a Jewish State's establishment concurrently Arab extremists retaliated with groups like the Arab higher committee and later The Holy War army aiming to counter Jewish insurgents and challenge British Bri rule the 1940s witnessed an escalating spiral of violence with both Jews and Palestinians employing terrorism as a means to further their respective nationalist agendas in the aftermath of the Holocaust which had convinced many Jews that they could never be safe without their own State the United Nations proposed a two-state solution in 1947 envisioning separate Jewish and Arab states the plan designated the fertile G Gile region the coastal plain and the negtive desert to the proposed Jewish State conversely the hill regions of Judea and Samaria along with the coastal Gaza Strip were allocated to the proposed Arab State Jerusalem holding religious significance for both communities was to be an international City these allocations aimed to distribute the Land Based on demographic and agricultural considerations but significantly altered the existing territorial status quo fueling intentions further the Jewish leadership accepted the proposal seeing it as a step toward an independent Jewish State however the Arab leadership rejected it outright refusing to recognize any partition of the territory and the separation of its peoples seeing few other options Jewish leaders declared independence in 1948 establishing the state of Israel this immediately triggered the Arab Israeli War as neighboring Arab States invaded to crush what they saw saw as a Zionist occupation despite the odds stacked against the Israeli Defenders the war ended in 1949 with an Israeli Victory establishing the green line as the deao border for the new Jewish State the green line expanded Israel's territory beyond the un's proposed boundaries incorporating Western Galilee and a broad Corridor through the Negev Desert by the end of the war over 700,000 Palestinians had been permanently displaced from their Homeland with many reduced to the status of refugees this event would be known as the nakba or catastrophe by surviving Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world although hostilities ceased the agreements didn't resolve the core conflict merely pausing territorial disputes from 1949 to 1967 the Gaza Strip was under Egyptian occupation and the West Bank under Jordanian occupation the end of the war also saw Israel's alleged violation of the UN General Assembly resolution 181 as it expanded beyond the un's proposed boundaries further souring relations with neighboring Arab states concurrently border skirmishes issues Over The Straits of Tran and the 1956 Suez Crisis further exacerbated problems with the Arabs Israel's probing into surrounding territories and retaliatory actions against crossb attacks further strained relations in the region setting the stage for June 5th 1967 when preemptive Israeli air strikes against Egyptian airfields caused a coalition of Arab states to simultaneously declare war and attack Israel across multiple fronts despite being grossly outnumbered Israel quickly launched an immediate offensive capturing the Sinai Peninsula Gaza Strip West Bank East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights at a lightning pace the war concluded on June 10th marking what we now know as the 6-day war these newly acquired territories significantly expanded Israel's borders with the green line being superseded by the ceasefire lines established at the end of the conflict from 1967 onwards new Israeli settlements would be established across the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank often encroaching on Palestinian land to do so the aftermath of of the Six-Day War left a lingering tension in the region with the Arab states seeking to recover their territories lost to Israel these tensions eventually sparked the yam kapor war in 1973 where Egypt and Syria launched coordinated surprise attacks against Israel to regain the Sinai Peninsula and the Goen Heights however by the end of the war Israeli forces had repelled the invasions and even advanced into Egyptian and Syrian territories beyond the pre-war lines despite these territorial changes during the conflict the borders essentially returned to their pre-war status following disengagement agreements in 1974 and 1975 even with the memories of yam kapor still fresh an unprecedented moment occurred in 1978 at Camp David in the United States here agreements were signed between Egyptian president and War Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister manakum beIN which led to a peace treaty and normalized relations the following year part of this treaty involved Israel returning the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt which was finalized in 1982 meanwhile Israeli military rule over the West Bank transitioned to a semi civil Authority Under the Israeli Ministry of Defense since its establishment in 1964 the Palestine Liberation Organization gained significant influence in the region its Pursuit for Palestinian self-determination led to the Arab League officially deeming them the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in 1974 this recognition marked a pivotal moment in the Palestinian struggle as the pl's influence began to extend into neighboring countries like Lebanon this expansion contributed to Israel's 1982 operation peace for Galilee initially aimed at expelling PLO forces from Lebanon as the conflict rapidly escalated into an extended occupation of Southern Lebanon Israel established a security Zone to thwart attacks leading to intricate conflicts with Lebanese factions and the emergence of Hezbollah as a key political player in the region this occupation marked by its flagrant territorial violations significantly impacted Israeli Lebanese relations and the broader Middle Eastern geopolitical landscape the Israeli presence in southern Lebanon continued for nearly two decades marked by persistent military engagements political backlash as well as International scrutiny and criticism the occupation would only end with Israel's unilateral withdrawal in 2000 however this did not put an end to the pl's activities within Israel and other parts of the region the pl's involvement in hijackings attacks on civilians and Guerilla Warfare LED countries like the United States and Israel to label it a terrorist organization during that period though their reputation began to change over The Late 1980s the pl's chairman Yasser Arafat alongside other Palestinian parties became instrumental in setting the stage for the Oslo Accords which aimed to transition toward more structured Palestinian self-governance and a potential two-state solution signed in 1993 the Oslo Accords established the Palestinian Authority granting it limited self-rule over parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip for a transitional period with the aim of achieving a final peace settlement within 5 years the Accords divided the West Bank into three areas area a Under full Authority control area B under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control and area C Under full Israeli control the palestin inian Authority was given control over most population centers in the West Bank ant Gaza while Israel retained control over Jewish settlements military areas and most of the natural resources this Arrangement was meant to be a stepping stone toward a two-state solution although the subsequent Camp David negotiations in 2000 failed to establish a permanent settlement the transitional period set by the Oslo Accords was complex further exacerbated by the second inata a major Palestinian Uprising from 2000 to 2005 following the failed Camp David negotiations in 2005 shortly after the suppression of the uprising Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon took a unilateral step to withdraw from the Gaza Strip This evacuation involved dismantling all Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip and four in the northern West Bank the disengagement was aimed at improving Israeli security reducing friction between Israel and Palestinians and advancing the peace process but Israel still retained control over gaza's airspace territorial Waters and border crossings except for the land border with Egypt which is controlled by Egypt and the Palestinian Authority despite the disengagement relations did not improve the Gaza Strip instead came under the control of Hamas in 2007 following a civil war in the region this split the Palestinian territory deao with the West Bank controlled by the Palestinian National Authority and Gaza by Hamas ever since conditions in Gaza have been dire due to the Israeli and Egyptian blockades aimed at limiting hamas's influence economic struggles and ongoing conflict more recently tensions between Hamas and Israel have surged culminating in the disastrous confrontation that began

of the first world war with concern when hostilities broke out in July of 1914 American ambassador to France myant T heric advocated taking an active role in mediation expression from our nation would have great weight in this crisis a strong plea for delay and moderation from the president of the United States would meet with the respect and approval of Europe President Wilson called for neutrality on an existential level exhorting all Americans to preserve neutrality in thought and in deed to this end the government prohibited American Banks from loaning money to any belligerent Nation an act that the then Secretary of State and noted gold hater William Jennings Brian hoped would both cement American neutrality and bring the war to a speedy conclusion one cannot fight with an empty War chest after all this fiscal neutrality was not long lived as President Wilson reversed the decision in 1915 in response to the British Empire indicating their stockpiles of cash were about to run out and thus they could not afford to continue buying American Goods though protesting its neutrality at each turn the United States was all too Keen to do business with the anant with the metaphorical floodgates opened American creditors sent a veritable tsunami of greenbacks to the British Empire who turned right around and spent that money in the United States but the British were not the only foreign shoppers in American markets as the German Empire too sought to buy critical supplies from Uncle Sam with the Western Front grinding to a stalemate Germany hired ships from neutral countries to Ferry food and other necessities purchased in the United States to the continent but British Naval Supremacy and their blockade of Germany prevented much of it from getting through the United States formerly protested the British blockade in March of 1915 but the issue was quite resolved in a meeting that saw the United States accept a British prohibition on selling food to Germany when the blockade began impacting American cotton exports and threatening a vital pillar of the economy Britain agreed to increase their cotton purchases to cover the shortfall the upshot of all of this economic backro dealing was an ostensibly neutral United States bowing to any small pressure from the British Empire to stop selling to Germany between 1914 to 19 16 American trade with the German Empire plummeted by an economy shattering 99% Germany backs to an economic wall ordered a submarine blockade of Great Britain in retaliation the United States protested declaring this to be a violation of international law this double standard accepting a British blockade of Germany but not a German blockade of Britain was acknowledged and waved Away by President Wilson who claimed that the British Navy did not threaten American lives in the same way that Germany's powerful Fleet of submarines did Wilson was unaware that Germany had only nine submarines with which to enforce its blockade hardly the mammoth threat to American life that he seemed to imagine but the threat was still there as the sinking of the Lucitania on March 7th 1915 would throw into sharp relief the sinking of the RMS Lucitania which killed 128 American citizens was only one in a series of incidents that drove the American people further and further into the anons camp the American public already displeased at reports of German atrocities in Belgium condemned the apparent sinking of a civilian vessel and a diplomatic back and forth between Washington and Berlin ensued calls to enter the war rang in the halls of the capital stopped only by German promises to scale back their submarine operations America was pacified for now but German Americans began to face Prejudice at home Prejudice that would only intensify as the war progressed doubts of german-americans loyalty would be continuously raised with President Wilson declaring that any man who carries a hyphen with him carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vital of this Republic when he gets ready a nakedly hostile remark towards the largest non-english-speaking group in the United States at the time government stoked and homegrown paranoia escalated into violence with German Americans shot forced from their homes or lynched such as the case of Robert Paul Prager a naturalized citizen who was lynched as a spy in April of 1918 this hatred was further stoked by an incredible Act of sabotage as previously mentioned the antant funneled much money to Yankee businesses including Munitions plants Germany unable to buy American Weaponry thanks to the British blockade began sending spies to find where the anant was procuring and transporting weapons and munition and to Halt the flow of material if possible one such Point of Departure was black Tom Island in New York Harbor and on July 30th 1916 German agent decided to have a little fireworks show igniting over $20 million worth of stockpile Munitions the Germans created one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in human history a shock wave equivalent to a magnitude 5 earthquake was felt as far away as Philadelphia the Statue of Liberty was damaged and black Tom Island was devastated 110x 50 m crater left behind by the blast momentum was Stead building for the United States to enter the war and in a display of military acumin that would make Von bismar proud German planners determined that the best way to keep the United States from entering Wars was to actively Target their merchant shipping and threaten American lives their rationale was simple bringing back unrestricted submarine warfare and sinking every ship headed to Britain American or not would starve the anant into submission and end the war before the United States could even be moved to intervene American ships were sunk but President Wilson just barely reelected continued to Demmer instead proclaiming armed neutrality by ordering American ships to be armed and authorized to fire on any aggressor as their ships were raided and more were lost the American public began clamoring for more than just armed neutrality President Wilson continued to resist but his efforts were ended by the infamous Zimmerman Telegram an order by the German foreign minister to his men in Mexico to court America's Southern neighbor with Promises of recovering territory in Texas Arizona and New Mexico if they would invade the United States for these Central Powers President Wilson faced with all of these pressures asked his cabinet for advice and found a single word on all of his advisers lips both houses of the United States Congress passed resolutions supporting a war on Germany and President Wilson forly requested Congress acknowledge a state of War had been created by Germany's actions rather than declare war outright Congress responded by declaring war outright on April 6th 1917 neutrality had ended and it was time to go over there the United States that entered the first world war was far from a military power isolationism had taken its toll on America's Armed Forces leaving President Wilson to call up a minuscule standing army and dust off a Navy of Aging battleships this in a way suited the president just fine as Wilson believed the simple Act of entering the war would tip the balance of power firmly in the favor of the anant while the British and French clamored for a fight to the Finish Wilson had his gaze fixed firmly on bringing the Germans to the negotiating table and truly making this the war to end all wars with the passage of The Selective Service Act widespread conscription swelled the Americans numbers 2 million men had volunteered at the outbreak of war and conscription would see 2.8 million more go over there whether volunteers or conscripts Yankee troops began making their way to Europe American troops landed on European Shores in June of 1917 British and French commanders initially viewed the newly arrived Americans as reinforcements they could use to supplement their dwindling numbers some black soldiers including the famous Harlem Hell Fighters were folded into the French army for the duration of the war but General John Blackjack persing Infamous pacifier of the Philippines and commander of the American expeditionary Force sought to keep his men together in a unified American Army persing would largely get his way and the first major engagement fought by the Americans would come the following summer the Battle of con a German Salient at the Village of con represented a golden opportunity to persing who committed the first Infantry Division better known as The Big Red One to wipe it out this strike would not only consolidate on taunt Lions but persing hoped seeing the Americans in action would boost French confidence in their American comrades at 6:45 a.m. on May 28th 1918 American infantry Advanced under cover of French artillery French tanks and flamethrower detachments Advanced alongside the Yanks and the combined Force Advanced up the slopes of con despite the help of the French Gunners tankers and air support the Americans were mauled during the uphill battle yet they succeeded in capturing the village German counterattacks began not long thereafter but the Americans held firm turning back 2 days of offensives and keeping a firm grip on Quant the Americans accomplished their objective of not only taking the village but also demonstrating that they could be counted on in a scrap that scrap would come at Bellow wood a German offensive punched a hole in French lines and the US Marines were sent to plug the Gap pushing back the German assault and repelling numerous attempts to reopen the hole from there the Marines assaulted critical German positions in and around Bellow wood taking heavy casualties but accomplishing their objectives it was among the Trees of bellow that Marine lore could be written Captain Williams refusal to retreat has become the motto of the fifth Marines but Bellow wood and con were only the Prelude to the largest offensive in American military history to that point from September 26th to November 11th 1.2 million American troops embarked on the Muse argon offensive aimed at capturing the rail head at sedon the offensive hit immediate stumbling blocks as the Americans deployed inexperienced units already weakened by by the Spanish Flu as the battle dragged on both the Americans and the French sent troops to shore up the line the onon spirits would be lifted by an incredible Act of heroism Corporal Alvin York a sharp shooting infantryman from the 82nd infantry now the 82nd Airborne killed 25 and captured 132 Germans a feat that would earn him the Medal of Honor in a bid to break the

troops from States from Iowa to Alabama the Guardsmen were able to succeed where the Big Red One failed cracking coat to ChatOn and turning the tide of the offensive just in time for the Armistice to be signed on November 11th America would prove as active in peace as they were in the final days of the war President Wilson brought his 14 points to the negotiations at Versailles and pushed for these principles to provide the Bedrock for the post-war World Wilson envisioned A League of Nations that would promote Global Peace and provide a diplomatic alternative to fighting Wilson also sought to impose his peaceableness on Europe as a whole dismantling the Old Colonial system and promoting self-determination for All Peoples across the world but Wilson's ideas were not universally accepted with the previously mentioned secretary of state Lancing remarking that promoting self-determination would raise hopes which can never be realized and that the phrase is simply loaded with dynamite the British and French were equally skeptical with the French representative only reading Wilson's points when the German delegation requested that they be the basis of the peace talks fearing that the Americans and Germans would conclude a separate piece based on Wilson's ideas the French and British accepted the 14 points as Germany requested Wilson became quite popular for his peacemaking image and his League of Nations was formally established in 1920 but neither the Treaty of Versailles which ended the first world war nor the United States entry into the League of Nations were approved by Congress a sign that isolationism had returned to America's Shores America's war was over for now the stock market crash of of 1929 and the resulting Great Depression were especially hard on the United States in a desperate attempt to revitalize the economy president Herbert Hoover signed the 1930 Smoot Holly Tariff Act which raised customs duties to such an extent that imported goods became unaffordable to all but the wealthiest Americans instead of spurring domestic purchasing and production as intended the smoo Holly tariffs succeeded only in further damaging the world's economy as other nations passed retaliatory tariffs against American exports International Trade plummeted by 65% leading to the full collapse of banks in America and Europe as the world economy only increased its tail spin when Franklin Delano Roosevelt became president in 1933 he immediately set about implementing his New Deal program to strengthen America's economy and get people back to work it is August 1939 World tensions are escalating at an alarming rate the United States a rising power in global Affairs becomes more active in deterring the spread of the Axis powers in Europe and the Pacific these decisions would Mark the beginning of a chapter that saw America confront its principles its enemies and its own legacy after the first world war the United States was Keen to remain out of European Affairs huge losses experienced during the war combined with economic hardships from the Great Depression prioritized domestic concerns over Foreign Affairs America's isolationism was further influenced by the NY committee's findings in 1934 their report suggested that propaganda rather than genuine threats had been a significant factor in the US's decision to enter the first world war as a result the US government solidified its stance on remaining neutral in global conflicts by passing the Neutrality Acts between 1935 and 1937 which prevented arms loans and credit being sent to belligerent Nations however the late 1930s showed unmistakable signs of a greater conflict Brewing President Franklin D Roosevelt while initially advocating for isolation started to reconsider America's role on the global stage as access countries snatched territories across Europe Asia and Africa he believed that it was essential to support the Allies indirectly the cash and carry policy introduced in November 1939 was one such initiative which allowed European nations to purchase goods from the US provided they handled transportation and payment another significant policy was the 1940 destroyers for bases deal which facilitated the transfer of Naval destroyers to Britain in exchange the US was granted access to specific military bases within British territory by March 1941 Roosevelt signed the lentle bill which permitted him to sell or transfer any American defense articles to any government whose defense was also deemed vital to the defense of the United States in April this policy was extended to the nationalists in China and later in October to the Soviets due to operation Barbarosa parallel to these diplomatic and economic strategies the US Merchant Marine was actively involved in supporting the Allied efforts tasked with the crucial responsibility of transporting supplies they continually risked confrontations with German and Japanese forces recognizing their importance the US initiated the production of cargo vessels known as Liberty ships from January 194 1 onwards to bolster the merchant marines capacity a pivotal moment in the US's approach to the impending World conflict was the meeting between Roosevelt and British prime minister Winston Churchill in August of 1941 the two leaders deliberated on potential strategies and mutual goals while Roosevelt was keen on supporting the Allies further he understood that a clear and direct reason was essential for the US to commit mil militarily that defining moment arrived in December 1941 with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor propelling the United States into the second world war as Germany conquered Europe Japan set about acquiring the territories necessary for their co-prosperity beyond their gains in China Japan Incorporated French Indochina with German consent on September 22nd 1940 occup Ying the former colonies until the vichi French authorities bowed to the Japanese demands 4 days later the next day Japan signed The tripartite Pact concluding a defensive alliance with Germany and Italy against the United States who by this time had sought to  Japan's war effort with harsh sanctions and embargos on much needed resources like Machine Tools aviation fuel and scrap metal the need for these resources coupled with fears of an eventual Oil Embargo drove Japan further toward establishing their co-prosperity sphere which was deemed vital for the ongoing War in China at home the Japanese public were galvanized into support of the Empire through intense repression and propaganda anti-subversion laws and controls over the intelligencia were implemented to discourage liberal Tendencies education on all levels was revoked to indoctrinate the youth shaping them as future assets for Japanese Supremacy over Asia and the Pacific Imperial propagandists Incorporated Shinto religious traditions in this effort forming a state sanctioned cult which served the Empire's interest first and foremost above all this Hirohito reigned as the Divine figurehead Emperor shaah it was under his name that Japanese Fighters dedicated their famous Bonsai battlecry charging recklessly into the enemy with bayonets swords or in the cockpit of a diving aircraft militarily resources of the co-prosperity sphere would be secured under a national resource Zone which stretched from Burma to Melania to protect this Zone the newly conquered territories would be defended by the Army while the Navy secured its ocean Lanes this daunting task of Naval superiority in the Pacific was made attainable thanks to Japan withdrawing from the Washington Naval limitation treaty in 193 7 giving the Navy ample time to construct some of the largest battleships ever built like the Yamoto and the Musashi at the same time senior staff held doubts about these super battleships urging those in government to shift Focus toward air power and submarines needed for the National Defense Zone of those senior staff the most notable was its commanderin-chief Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto who was a longtime believer in Naval Aviation ation something which played a key role in his plans for operation Z the attack on Pearl Harbor operation Z envisioned a preemptive strike on the US Pacific Fleet and her aircraft carriers taking advantage of a delayed American response to quickly invade and occupy all of the plant Southern resource zones on December 7th 1941 combined elements of Japan's first air fleet attacked without a declaration of war 350 aircraft attacked Pearl Harbor and military bases on Oahu with the US Navy losing four battleships 188 aircraft and 2400 Sailors over the next 4 hours the Japanese Navy only lost 29 aircraft and 55 Pilots soon after Japan invaded the Philippines Singapore and the rest of Southeast Asia with Little Resistance from the Allied Nations the surprise nature of these invasions succeeded thanks to the competence of Japanese commanders with examples like the Malay operation under General tomoyuki yamashta seeing the entire Peninsula captured by the 25th Army in a blitzk assault that lasted only 70 days on the home front a mixture of excitement and anxiety lingered among the public no Lantern parades rang out like after the capture of Nan King instead the Japanese expressed resolve in the face of a waking Giant by the end of 1941 the US military faced challenges in terms of training and equipment with less than 1,000 modern fighter planes combat ready there was a pressing need for Swift action Roosevelt responded by setting ambitious production targets a planned creation of 60,000 planes 45,000 tanks 20,000 anti-aircraft guns and 500,000 machine guns over the course of 1942 the war production board was initiated overseeing the Monumental task of converting civilian Industries into wartime production units companies like Ford transitioned from Cars to aircraft while lonol switched from toy trains to nautical equipment Roosevelt's strategy was clear outproduced the enemies at every juncture to deny their progress as men left for the front lines women stepped into roles in factories fueling the war effort in the early months of 194 4 2 the Pacific Theater witnessed intense combat between us and Japanese forces the doitt raid boosted American morale while the battle of the Coral Sea halted the Japanese Advance toward Australia in the Philippines American and Philippine troops made a Last Stand at Baton before succumbing this defeat led to the harrowing baton Death March where thousands of captured soldiers endured brutal conditions and treatments by their Japanese captors as these confrontations unfolded June brought about a pivotal change us intelligence anticipated a major Japanese offensive against Midway Island prepared for the onslaught American forces confronted a superior Japanese Fleet despite the odds US aircraft managed to break through hostile fire achieving a pivotal success dive bombers sank the Japanese carriers soru Kaka and akagi within a matter of minutes the here was later sunk the next day in late 1942 allied Landings in guad Canal left the Japanese isolated into pockets of resistance allowing the Allies to bypass them for bigger targets over 1943 the Japanese defense of the occupied Gilbert and Marshall Islands was marked by Fierce fighting on both land and sea with the Japanese suffering heavy losses due to the superior Firepower of the Allied Forces the Midway Victory signified a major shift propelling the us into its strategic island hopping campaign methodically advancing towards the Japanese Mainland the European theater began with Operation Torch in November 1942 starting with North Africa a region where Germany and Italy had secured strategic Coastal holds axis forces also controlled vast portions of the northern Mediterranean Coast which prevented Allied Shipping in the region given the tensions between Britain and France's territorial interests the American forces led by General Dwight Eisenhower bore the brunt of the operation in North Africa the US faced seasoned German forces for the first time at the Battle of cerine pass the US suffered a considerable setback against the famed Africa Corps grappling with poor leadership ill-chosen defensive positions and communication issues leading to isolated units and Equipment deficiencies their tanks as especially the M3 League struggled against the superior German panzers however these early setbacks proved invaluable learning rapidly from their mistakes and underestimating the enemy's prowess the Allies eventually trapped the axis in northeastern Tunisia forcing a surrender this campaign exposed areas for improvement but also laid the groundwork for future successes by providing essential combat experience after their engagements in North Africa the US recognized these strategic importance of securing the Mediterranean here the Allies launched operation husky in July 1943 this invasion of Sicily saw significant battles like the Battle of Jaya where American forces faced the full onslaught of combined German and Italian Air Raids as well as armored assaults with the successful capture of Sicily the path to the Italian Mainland was open September 1943 began with The Landings at solerno followed by the amphibious assault at anzio both operations met Fierce German resistance yet the Allies pressed on encountering bloody battles like Monte Casino which witnessed a series of four hardfought assaults before the Fortified Monastery was finally taken the push northward continued with the gothic line being another formidable German defensive position the Allies had to breach by the end of 1943 Italy officially surrendered but the battle against the German forces in the region raged on until May 1945 the drawn out Italian campaign tied down significant German resources these 26 divisions who engaged in Fierce battles against the Allies in Italy were absent from the Western Front potentially altering the Dynamics of the battles in Normandy 1944 heralded a pivotal phase even as battles raged in Italy the Allies were already plotting their next significant move the invasion of France the D-Day invasion officially termed Operation Overlord was the centerpiece of this strategy amidst pressure to launch a second front in France planning for this colossal operation did so under Supreme Commander Dwight D Eisenhower's supervision the strategy was audacious choosing Normandy as The Invasion point was unexpected given its challenging terrain and lack of ports Eisenhower banked on this very unpredictability to catch the Germans offg guard the scale of Operation Overlord was staggering its enormity is best described in the American Heritage new history of World War II the scope of Overlord defies imagination one comparison is that Overlord was the equivalent of moving the Wisconsin cities of Green Bay rine and Kenosha every man woman and child with every vehicle across Lake Michigan in one night the invasion of Normandy codenamed Operation Overlord commenced in the late hours of June 5th 1944 as an armada of c47 Transport planes carrying the American 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions made its way toward the couton peninsula the elite paratroopers were entrusted with the crucial task of Paving the way for the Seaborn forces landing at Utopia Beach just after Dawn the 101st would secure the causeways between the towns of sa Marton duville and Poopville while the 82nd would capture the crossroads at the town of s May iges and secure the vital Bridges across the meriday river at chef dupon and lafier Manor however things go arai almost immediately as thick Inland cloud cover and intense ground fire complicated things for the pilots in the result ing chaos most paratroopers miss their Drop Zones entirely as they are scattered all across the peninsula those who land safely nonetheless manage to quickly form makeshift units as they make their way to the nearest objective in most cases the confused German Defenders are quickly overwhelmed s iges becomes the first French town to be liberated at around 4:30 a.m. as men of the 82nd dig in for the EXP expected Counterattack at the lafier manure and Chef dupal Bridges to the West the bulk of the 101st due east in the meantime are in the process of clearing the five causeways to The Landing Beach where the invasion Force anchored just offshore is about to make its approach the fleet's target was a 5 km stretch of flat Sandy Beach just east of the Airborne Drop Zones codenamed Utah Beach on board of the invasion Fleet were the men of the fourth infantry division their objective was to establish a beach head approximately 5 km wide and 8 km deep with the ultimate goal to isolate the coutal peninsula and capture the deep water Port of cherborg the first step in achieving this objective would be to break through the defensive position of the German 79th static Infantry Division before advancing Inland on the five main road exits besides flooding the near nearby Farm Fields The Defenders had littered Utah beach with three lines of obstacles consisting of steel spikes and mined wooden posts as well as an array of anti-tank obstacles the Utah sector was covered by nine resistance nests or veran neston which were manned by platoon strength garrisons totaling about 700 troops at 550 the fleet commences its bombardment of known German positions along the coast meanwhile 270 B s close in to further soften up the German strong points however hindered by poor visibility and anxious not to hit the invasion Force few Pilots managed to hit their targets at 6:30 hours the first wave of 20 landing craft carrying part of the eighth regiment approaches the Beach's two sectors Uncle red and T green they are supposed to have landed behind a Vanguard of amphibious DD or duplex Drive tanks of the 70th tank battalion the 70th tanks however are struggling to advance in the face of heavy headwinds and wait ashore late around 6:45 a.m. luckily for the Infantry German resistance is lighter than expected and besides some small arms fire most casualties on the beach fall victim to artillery fire and mines as it turns out the strong swell that morning pulled the landing craft a mile or 1.5 km Southward to a sector less well defended than the previously designated Landing site despite this Good Fortune incoming artillery fire covering the various Beach exits continues to cause casualties and hamper the advance throughout the early morning hours a few miles Inland paratroopers of the 101st airborn division resolved the issue as they conduct a set of Daring assaults to silence the German batteries at oldi and bror Manor with these guns neutralized the men of the fourth infantry division managed to overrun the remaining German Beach defenses and by 8:30 hours are ready to begin their Advance up the causeways around noon men of the eighth regiment make contact with elements of the 101st Airborne Division at Poopville further Inland at s Marie dumal the regiment's thirdd Battalion prepares for a battle but finds the town already liberated by Troopers of the 506th parachute Infantry Regiment who had cleared it in close quarters fighting earlier that day the Swift and mostly painless advance of the eighth regiment is finally ordered to a halt at the end of the day at the crossroads at Leo some 10 km Inland meanwhile men from the 12th and 22nd regiments Landing in follow-up waves move to secure the northern and Northwestern flanks of the beach head until they too penetrate around 10 km into German held territory by the end of the day the Utah operation had been a success the fourth infantry division had achieved nearly all of its its objectives in return for just 197 casualties a number far lower than had been anticipated the Airborne divisions had suffered more heavily during their chaotic nighttime drop but they too had managed to achieve the majority of their primary objectives within 24 hours the Americans had established a firm Beach head on the couton peninsula through a mixture of exemplary skill and sheer luck some 23,25 men and 1,700 Vehicles were asore with countless more to follow in the days weeks and months to come these fortunes however would be in short supply for the American forces set to land further east about 15 km to the east of Utah Beach a group of 225 elite soldiers from the second ranger battalion under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James Rudder are headed towards the protruding Cliffs of the penta dhawk the Rangers were entrusted with the daunting task of scaling the 30 m High Cliffs to to prevent its artillery battery from pummeling the American Invasion beaches once on top the Americans would have to fight their way through a series of defensive works and obstacles manned by men from the 716th static Infantry Division in order to reach the gun placements things don't start out well for rudder's men on D-Day his troops are scheduled to land at 6:30 but due to a navigational mishap they don't reach the beach until 10 7 the alerted Germans greet the Rangers with Small Arms fire grenades and even rocks as the lad begin making their way up the cliff by 7:30 hours the first exhausted Rangers have made their way to the top to find a moonlike landscape of deep craters created by preliminary bombardment in a wild and frenzied scene rudder's men stormed the Imp placements only to find that the guns are not there fears that their sacrifice had been for nothing are soon alleviated when a patrol finds that the guns are intact in a field just behind the p with their main objective completed the remaining Rangers dig in for the inevitable German Counterattack and wait to be relieved by The Invasion Force landing at the neighboring Omaha Beach the Western end of Omaha Beach lay just about 6 km to the east of p dhawk and stretched all the way from the area around verville Su to the cliffs near cville Sumer some 8 km to the east the most prominent characteristic of this wide and mostly Sandy Beach was a series of Bluffs which offered a commanding view over the coastline five natural draws between the Bluffs offered the only exits off the beach for vehicles and heavy ordinance the Germans were well aware of the potential for a landing in the Omaha sector and had constructed an intricate web of obstacles and resistance nests to cover the approaches to the draws the beach itself had been littered with obstacles of all kinds soldiers disembarking in the shallows would first have to Traverse an array of mined stakes and iron frames as well as Hedgehog anti-tank obstacles barbed wire covered the seaw wall and dunes further on while the draws were blocked off by minefields and concrete walls as well as remote controlled flamethrowers furthermore in order for soldiers in most sectors to even reach the draws they would have to cross the Shelf which was a roughly football field-sized gap of open ground between the seaw wall and the base of the Bluffs but to even get to that point the Americans would have to Brave a deadly and sophisticated set of resistance nests most of these strong points were hidden from sight camouflaged and placed at an angle to protect them from enemy fire the slight curve of the coastline also meant that resistance nests on both the eastern and western edges of the beach could provide interlocking fields of fire Across The Landing ground three additional resistance nests were positioned behind the Bluffs should the Invaders manag to break breakthrough in total the resistance nests in the Omaha sector were composed of eight big gun imp placements 35 pillboxes 18 anti-tank guns and 85 machine gun nests being the largest and the most well- defended of the two American beaches Allied command had assigned both the 29th Infantry Division as well as the veteran first Infantry Division to secure the Bluffs by 730 hours link up with the British forces advancing from Gold Beach at P Al Bon and securing an overall Beach head 26 km wide and 8 km deep at 555 hours the preliminary air and Naval bombardment begins pounding the German positions but once again the bomber Pilots delay too long and end up missing their target entirely with the German defenses still intact the first wave begins to make its Approach at 6:30 some landing craft are hit as they close in on the beach and many soldiers are cut down to make matters worse almost all of the DD tanks that were supposed to land ahead of the Infantry have floundered in the rough Channel Waters after having been launched far too early at 5.5 km from the shore within minutes companies a and F of the 116th Infantry Regiment landing at dog green and dog red are virtually wiped out however not every sector of Omaha is as well defended at dog white G company reaches the base of the beach within 4 minutes of Landing while at Fox red at the Far Eastern end of Omaha men from the 16th regiment make use of the cliffs in that sector to Shield themselves from enemy fire at around 8:00 a group of men under command of General Norman Kota in the dog white sector managed to blow a hole in the barbed wire in the dog white sector and Advance up the Steep Bluffs to take out w70 before moving on to clear the vieille draw to the east in the fox sector a group of soldiers led by Lieutenant Jimmy W montith similarly man man AG to fight their way up the exit and take out W n60 the majority of the troops near the draws are however still hopelessly pinned down and their sectors quickly become congested with the arrival of subsequent waves to make matters worse the incoming tide begins to shallow the wounded and the dead while slowly reducing the size of the beach even further sensing catastrophe a group of US Navy destroyers Brave enemy fire as they move in as close as 800 M from the shore line with their direct fire support eight German gun and placements are knocked out providing enough of an opening for the ground troops to recontinue their Advance up the bluffs with the German defenses now being breached in several sectors the tide begins to turn in the Americans favor the assault teams on the Bluffs quickly Swing West and East to flank the remaining German positions while the other groups Advance on the towns of verville and cville sume by the end of the day the Americans at Omaha had secured the Bluffs by but the advance off the beach had only reached 1.5 km Inland this precarious foothold on the Normandy Coast had come at the cost of over 4,000 us casualties still Omaha had been secured and the Germans lacked the strength to attempt to push the Americans back into the channel following the initial Landings in Normandy the Allies made significant progress into French territory marking notable victories including the iconic liberation of Paris importantly they were beginning to position themselves close to the Rind however as they pushed deeper into France the logistical challenges mounted distance from the initial Beach heads in Normandy strained their supply lines leading to a critical gasoline shortage that threatened to Halt their momentum this logistical challenge catalyzed a strategic debate among the top brass British General Bernard Montgomery believed that pausing General George S Patton's advance and relocating crucial resources to his own forces would allow for a swift push toward Berlin in contrast Patton was confident in leading the offensive himself Eisenhower responsible for the overarching strategy found Merit in Montgomery's approach in September 1944 the Allies launched operation Market Garden in the Netherlands aiming to seize key Bridges to pave a path into Germany the operation was split into two phases market and garden the Airborne component mark Market saw the US 101st Airborne capturing einthoven's Bridges the Airborne component Market saw the US's 101st Airborne capturing einthoven's Bridges while the 82nd targeted nyagan concurrently Garden involved ground troops advancing to support the Airborne units hoping to exploit the newly secured routes while the operation saw initial successes it met staunch resistance by German forces especially at arnam preventing the full achievement of operation Market Gardens objectives the Shadows have just begun to lengthen in the streets of aan and an American Rifle Team creeps cautiously along an ancient Street backs to imposing Gothic architecture though scarred by artillery fire the giant Stone monuments still retain the grandure of a former capital city behind the team an M4 Sherman slowly crawls into the open and the street behind the tank erupts in flame one GI snaps toward the source of the misdirected rocket and instead of a fanatic SS Grenadier his eyes meet the terrified gaze of a trembling old man a mly crew of Elders and boys fired down at the Americans with a hodg podge of antique firearms the G's View is obscured by smoke and debris as the Sherman's main gun fires into the ground floor of the closest building bringing it crashing down with a roar of falling masonry the gis come to a grim realization even in their chaotic desperation the Germans intend to make them pay for every inch of Aken in [Music] blood unfortunately for Adolf Hitler the Nazi governors of aen had taken one look at the onrushing Allied armies and promptly abandoned the civilian population to its fate infuriated by this display of cowardice Hitler had the officials arrested by the SS and shipped off to the Eastern front by the time General Gart vanarin dragged the shattered remnants of his 116th Panzer Division through the city he found it full of thousands of terrified civilians ions and a rag tag collection of vstorm militia knowing a lost cause when he saw one vfin paused just long enough to leave a letter at the post office designating Aken as an open City for the incoming Allied Forces the deeply unlucky General then ran head first into orders coming the other direction telling him to turn his division around and return to the city for a Last Stand now naturally he had been gone just long enough for a Sharp eyed Sho staffle to have found the letter and he was promptly relieved of command defense of the sector now fell on the shoulders of Lieutenant General Friedrich J kling's 81st core consisting mainly of two vul Grenadier and two infantry divisions while the Germans scrambled to put together a viable strategy the three Army Corps of the American first Army under General Courtney H Hodges crept close closer and closer despite the Apparently tenuous nature of the German defenses nobody was under any Illusions about the meat grinder that lay ahead Sergeant Harley Reynolds of the bloody first division described the mood thusly I can remember the talk and comments about the city of Aken that no way would the Germans give up this city without a fight to the last German standing we talked about this among the ranks I felt there was a good chance that they would possibly Drive us back with a big Counterattack we were a finger sticking out in front of the US line a very dangerous position surprisingly enough the initial skirmishes that took place as the first Army moved to breach the West wall around aen in early September proceeded with minimal casualties while three infantry regiments pushed through the forest to the west side of the city two armored regiments began a flanking attack towards the town of stolberg at first the attackers were daunted by the sheer scale of the defensive Works they encountered hundreds of pill boxes and dozens of bunkers with overlapping fields of fire overlooking extensive Mine Fields and concrete anti-tank obstacles yet resistance was light as the Eastern Front was still occupying the majority of German Manpower leaving only a scattering of exhausted veterans and walking wounded to man a network of defenses originally intended to be garrisoned by entire armies unfortunately General Courtney's Swift progress was ground to an abrupt halt by factors beyond his control granting the Germans the critical break they needed to get their act together the Allied Supply situation had been shaky at best since the Normandy Landings and it would not improve for the boys near Aken as September rolled in the planners of operation Market Garden which occurred at about the same time seemingly did their best to waste as much fuel ammunition and Manpower as possible in their abortive attempt to breach German lines in the Netherlands having been bumped far down the priority list the men of the first Army trudged onwards trying to make best use of the good weather whilst their supplies dwindled on the 22nd of September the same day operation Market Garden ended the 16th Infantry Regiment was on the verge of capturing the town of isor just south of aen when they abruptly came under massive artillery fire as the smoke cleared the German 12th Infantry Division arrived to politely informed the Allies that the good times were over and the real fight had just begun though few in Number the professional soldiers of the 12th had been supplemented by a swarm of voler militia and traumatized Americans later recalled the sight of women and children fighting with pistols knives and even Panzer fou anti-tank weapons one Commander reported that the Germans had simply gone mad and are bent on destroying themselves the Americans were able to hold their positions during the Savage engagement but were prevented from advancing just long enough for heavy cloud cover to descend over the region eliminating the possibility of close air support now exper experiencing major shortages of fuel heavy Munitions and spare parts for armored vehicles the frustrated men of the first Army were forced to Halt all offensive operations until the first week of October during this critical period Lieutenant General kling's 81st Corp was heavily reinforced the exact number of German soldiers committed to the battle is impossible to determine but by the 2nd of October around 24,000 raw recruits traumatized veterans SS Fanatics and terrified vogm stood ready to give their lives to defend the capital of the actual Thousand-Year Reich together they huddled in their bunkers and pill boxes as the Allies saturated the region with artillery fire and bombing raids between September 27th and October 2nd after which the ground offensive resumed having now partially enveloped Aken the first Army sought to break through German lines in the north to encircle the old Capital completely sadly for the Americans the West Wall absorbed the bombardment with barely a scratch forcing the Infantry to begin the incredible laborious process of dislodging the Defenders one fortification at a time in the town of ubach palen GIS engaged in brutal Urban Warfare with the German Defenders which often devolved into both sides flinging grenades at each other until entire neighborhoods were reduced to Rubble with most of the bridges in the region having been destroyed American armored forces were constantly delayed by river Crossings and were unable to provide support for the Infantry by the end of just the first day of fighting the leading American 117th infantry battalion had lost 146 men another Battalion had 58 wounded and 12 dead over 50 pill boxes had been destroyed or captured but hundreds still lay between the first Army and victory in the sector over the next few days The Vicious Urban Warfare intensified and GIS quickly learned to approach enemy pillboxes only if flamethrowers or demolition charges were available Defenders were roasted in their concrete shells or blasted into ruin by tanks and self-propelled guns but rarely chose to surrender all the wild German reinforcements raced into the sector including the elite first SS Panzer Division by the 7th of October the Allies had successfully secured the area around ubach palag and pushed southwards as far as aldorf but had yet to enter Aken itself which was now home to about 5,000 enemy troops instead fighting was concentrated around these suburbs with the 26th Infantry Division led by Lieutenant Colonel darl M Daniel slowly clawing a foothold out of the rtha era District once this area was secured plans were made for the regiment to push North Into the Heart of the City [Music] in an effort to avert a blood bath Lieutenant General Clarence R hubner of the first infantry division sent an ultimatum to the commander of German forces in aen Colonel Gart Vil on October 10th in his letter Huer demanded the city surrender or be bombed to Oblivion but Aken was now fully in the grip of the SS who were quite ready to execute any soldier who showed even a hint hint of cowardice Beyond this fear of capital punishment the soldiers defending the aan section of the West Wall knew that they were now fighting to protect the very Heartland of Germany as a result the offer was rejected and Colonel Vil assumed full responsibility for the defense after establishing his headquarters in the north side of the city the 11th of October saw a shift in Allied tactics with their supply situation stabilized ing Mass artillery bombardment commenced on Aken and the surrounding German held townships tired of the bloody street fighting the Americans were ready to Simply level every building that could feasibly hold enemy combatants this forced the Germans onto the offensive but their efforts to reclaim The High Ground surrounding Aken all ended in Failure by this point the picturesque City had been subjected to an on andof bombardment for weeks as well as numerous Air Raids but the Gothic architecture had proven surprisingly resilient with the majority of the first Infantry Division holding off German counter attacks two battalions of the 26th Infantry Regiment began to move through the industrial district between rtha adaa and the suburb of hen their objectives were three hills dominating Akin's Northern quarter which contained the bulk of the 246th folks grenadiers and Colonel Vil's headquarters by the 12th the second and third battalions had managed to clear out the industrial district and were ready to enter the narrow Twisted Maze of streets that made up the inner city knowing that massing his troops would lead to a Slaughter Colonel Daniel split up his men into assault platoon assigning a single M4 Sherman or self-propelled gun to each unit upon seeing the massive stone structures at the Heart of the City Daniels issued simple instructions knock them all down despite letting their artillery rain fire over 10,000 shells prior to the main assault the first American soldiers to set foot in Aken were still greeted with a hail of machine gun fire forcing them to scramble for cover in the imposing Stone buildings that lined the narrow streets here they were ambushed by Wildey vstorm who sprung from hidden basements and cellers to engage the gis in hand-to-hand combat the tanks fared little better being at the mercy of hidden anti-tank guns and lone German soldiers armed with Panzer FS or sticky grenades once again the attackers were forced to go room by room checking for Germans waiting to Ambush them the instant their backs were turned as they crawled closer to their objectives second Battalion was confronted by increasingly tough fortifications including hardened air raage shelters improvising Colonel John T Corley ordered an M12 155 mm gun mortar Carriage to Lumber through the streets the exposed crew no doubt ducking at every shadow as they wheeled into position to blast holes in enemy strongholds at Point Blank Range delighted with the results of the attack Corley rewarded the m12s crew by informing them they would be staying with his men as they Advanced deeper into the city the rest of the day was spent advancing towards Observatory Hill so named for the observation tower built upon its nearly 900t tall Crescent by the end of the 13th Third Battalion had managed to reach the base of one of these three hills they had been assigned to capture prompting Colonel Vil to request reinforcements from the German divisions still counterattacking to the east thanks to the dense Urban Terrain several hundred troops and at least a half dozen assault guns slipped through the tenuous Allied line the next day they were just in time to engage Colonel corley's men as they attacked Vil's headquarters at farwick Park where an intense battle raged until the early evening but as Corley prepared to renew his Advance he was countermanded by Colonel hubner the forces outside aen had launched another attack tying up all available reserves for over 24 hours General kling's 81st Corps battered the beleaguered first division until both sides were utterly exhausted but aided by artillery and air support the Americans were able to dig in and weather the assault then strike back at the collapsing German line with a decisive blow finally the jaws of the Allied pincer movement were able to slam shut completely encircling aen and leaving Colonel Vil isolated from further reinforcements their Eastern flank now secure the first Army was able to take its time mopping up the remaining Germans in Aken on the 18th second Battalion resumed its attack on farwick Park driving the Defenders into the basement with an artillery barrage before sending assault squads in to secure the kelin Hof Hotel though Colonel Vil had already left the hotel The Defenders put up a tremendous fight hurling grenades from every entrance and forcing GIS back in the end Colonel Corley had to threaten to demolish the entire structure before the Germans finally agreed to surrender the loss of farwick Park was a death blow to the German resistance in Aken and not even a written order from Colonel Vil encouraging his troops to fight to the last man inspired much determination with huge swaths of the city now under American control the survivors of the 246th vks grenadiers were hemmed in on their remaining hilltops with Observatory Hill falling to the second Battalion on the 19th by now aen was little more than a mound of Rebel as the Americans systematically demolished any building that could even potentially Harbor enemy combatants with essentially no ground left to go Colonel Vil was finally cornered in an air raage shelter on the 20th as Corley wheeled his favorite 155 mm gun into position Outside The Fortress Vil realized the game was up and dispatched several American PS to carry a message of surrender to the besiegers this Victory served as a Prelude to the challenges in the huren forest here amidst snow Laden terrain and minefields American troops faced dogged German defenses incurring heavy casualties December marked a German research with a surprise counter offensive in the Arden aiming to exploit the thinly spread lines of the US 12th Army group in the snow drifts of Bastone a young GI grips his rifle the Americans stand ready to meet their foes eager to have a standup fight after nights of fruitless watches our GI scans the tree line expecting to see black clad SS soldiers burst forth into his Firing Line gunfire in the distance the den of combat finally some action figures emerge from the trees and he raises his rifle to those aren't Germans as his comrades from the 99th division dive into cover scrambling to get as far away from the forest as they can our GI grabs a runner by the arm what's going on the Haggard soldier from the 99th barely gets it out the 99th is gone and the SS who wiped them out are right behind them the Battle of the Bulge was Nazi Germany's final attempt to wrestle back control of the war on the Western Front at this stage of the war Germany was hemmed in on three sides and the Nazis had few options to relieve the pressure an offensive in the East would simply be swallowed by the immense Soviet Red arm Army while doubling down on the Italian front would have only a marginal impact to Hitler the natural option was a surprise push across the relatively lightly defended Arden and a drive toward the Dutch Coast to force a wedge between the Commonwealth and American forces and if he was lucky Force the Allies into a second evacuation like dunker the vermos laid out their plans in the utmost secrecy code naming the offensive operation V amran after a Prussian patriotic Anthem only a handful of Hitler's closest commanders knew of the plan and each was forced to sign a pledge of secrecy on pain of death before learning its details regimental commanders meanwhile were only to be briefed the day before the attack was to take place to avoid tipping off the Americans troops moved across the thickly forested Eiffel region during the night and sheltered in villages by day with their vehicles concealed in Barns Maps were distributed only at the very last moment and total radio silence was observed consequently Allied air reconnaissance completely failed to notice these new troop concentrations though made a high priority Vash amran was a divisive operation field Marshall vham kidle was an ardent supporter but many other commanders remained skeptical believing the units would be better utilized in the defense of the Reich General zek freed vestfall was among those who did not believe the available forces could ever reach the River Muse but refrained from Raising any objections for fear of being labeled a defeatist Garrett Von runat and wter modal also agreed this was simply one of Hitler's map fantasies although modal saw the offensive as a final gamble he had no choice but to carry out the Allies certainly didn't expect an attack the highest echelons of Allied command assumed the Germans were preparing a Counterattack against an American crossing of the River Roar on the eve of the offensive British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery said the shortages of German Manpower equipment and resources precluded any offensive action on their part he wasn't far wrong field commander ERS knew fuel would be a major problem particularly in the difficult terrain of the Arden the sixth Panzer Army under sep would advance in the north the fifth Panzer Army under HOV Von manto in the center and Eric brandenberger seventh Army would take the South the two Panzer forces were to push toward ANP while the Infantry would protect the southern flank against General George ESP Patton's third Army Dietrich was to cross the vital Bridges Over the River Muse within the first 24 hours of the assault before pushing onto onp Monto meanwhile would capture Brussels to reach the Muse the Germans first had to pass through the Junctions at sonit and pone the capture of which was crucial for maintaining a stream of supplies to the advancing forces the sixth Panzer Army advancing toward m was given special priority by Hitler it included the elite of the waffin SS most notably com groupa Piper led by its ruthless namesake Piper's unit consisting of roughly 4,800 men and 800 Vehicles would form the Vanguard of the northern thrust the offensive would be preceded by operation gri during which a special Brigade trained under the command of ss Colonel OSI was to adopt American customs and infiltrate Enemy Lines dressed as American soldiers to capture key Bridges eight of his nine Jeep teams managed to slip through the net undetected cutting wires tampering with road signs and committing minor acts of sabotage one even managed to misdirect an entire Infantry Regiment the Germans would not find themselves facing the cream of America's fighting men the American Defenders comprised six divisions of seventh Corp most of them brand new to the field or redeployed to the Arden as a kind of working vacation after intense battle days before the attack the 106th Infantry Division heard tanks and other vehicles moving to their section of the front but their inexperience gave them no idea what it meant even the experienced fourth infantry division assumed the engine noises were merely one of Folk's Grenadier division replacing another in the early hours of December 16th the Americans were torn from sleep by the screams of rockets and Bone rattling pounding of field guns sep dietrich's sixth Panzer Army had opened fire against known US Army positions in the first action of the battle as the gis scrambled out of their sleeping bags manful who had decided to ignore Hitler's insistence on an opening artillery barrage crossed the river sour in secret preferring to take the sleeping Americans by surprise as he did so engineer battalions began Bridging the river Ur So the 116th 2 and 130th Panzer Lair could follow evidently the Gambit succeeded a number of American soldiers panicked and fled one officer acknowledged that a few men broke Under The Strain wetting themselves repeatedly or vomiting or showing other severe symptoms many American positions were surrounded and captured but others were defended in stunning acts of Bravery such as when Lieutenant Lyle JB Jr of the 99th division held a null at Lonzo for the entire day with only only 18 men they killed and wounded over 400 enemies at a cost of just one life the fierce resistance of the 99th held up comp group Piper in particular in his impatience Piper ordered his vehicles to push forward rapidly and to ruthlessly run down anything in their way even driving them through the American Minefield at the cost of five panzers although the element of surprise counted for a lot the German Advance was not a total success and some suffered from numerous delays and errors early in the morning the 326th V Grenadier division Advanced with the aim of blocking the roads to openen and aen and prevent any American reinforcements coming in from the north however the Germans own artificial Moonlight a glow created by bouncing search lights off clouds silhouetted the vog grenadiers perfectly against the mist and snow and the Americans had themselves a turkey shoot forcing the 326 back within an hour the weather was a constant irritation German forces experienced horrendous conditions on the road and in terms of visibility which meant while they struggled to move the Allies also struggled to impose their air power over the battlefield nevertheless on December 17th the Germans were satisfied with their progress and morale was high a soldier in the third ponzer Grenadier division wrote I think the war in the west is again turning the main thing is that the war will soon be decided and I will be coming home again to my dear wife and we can again build a new home that day Eisenhower ordered all Reserve formations to the front he decided that Bastone through which the main roads leading to the Muse passed was the obvious place to block the German Advance the 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions were immediately dispatched if the first could reach Bastone before monto's spearhead perhaps these Screaming Eagles could turn the tide Eisenhower had ample reason to be concerned Piper had chosen to ignore the route mapped out by Hitler due to muddy tracks instead capturing hunfeld and bingan where he seized a fuel dump unopposed at each Village his men massacred American PS and local villagers Piper committed his most heinous crime at bonier here he murdered 84 PS of the 285th field artillery observation Battalion in what would become one of the most infamous episodes on the Western Front Hereafter rumors of the SS massacr spread fear among the American forces in the South monto's Fifth Panzer Army moved against the 28th division surrounding the ancient town of clairville which was defended heroically But ultimately fruitlessly by outnumbered and out gunned men despite this Brave defense first Army HQ ended the day in somber Spirits fearing the Germans were on the verge of forming vital Bridge heads over the Muse the next day the Germans continued their assault overrunning American positions in an attack against the last battalion of the second division just 197 Americans survived the assault their final stand combined with artillery support helped save the rest of the division first Army HQ was hastily evacuated and moved to sh Fontaine but Defenders at twon managed to saave off Panzer grenadiers trying to cross the river searching for alternative routes Piper found the forested slopes at llaz impossible to Traverse and the bridge over the river Leen already blown up resistance prevented the Germans from reaching best stone but US headquarters was still struck by paralysis by the end of the day General Bradley still had no idea first Army HQ had been abandoned the Americans were fighting and dying to protect an empty house on the 19th Bradley and General Patton were summoned to Verdun to meet Eisenhower the meeting led to a reorganization of the Allied defense and thanks to intercepted German Communications they now had a clearer idea of the lay of the land Eisenhower insisted there would be no withdrawal behind the Muse instead Alexander patches seventh Army would extend northward to cover for part of Patton's thirdd Army while Patton himself would advance to bestone to relieve the city's beleaguered Defenders both sides continued to suffer heavy casualties over the next few days with repeated German attempts to capture bone repulsed by heavy American artillery bombardments nonetheless by the evening of the 21st the town was almost entirely surrounded despite resistance and delays the Germans were confident one cheerful lant wrote to his wife you cannot imagine what glorious hours and days we are experiencing now it looks as if the Americans cannot withstand our important push on the 22nd the German Commander litz sent the Americans a demand to surrender General Anthony Mcall in charge of baston's Garrison simply sent the words nuts in return yet the demand was a block litz lacked the strength to annihilate the Defenders preferring instead to wait for reinforcements or else starve the besieged men out the latter was a distinct possibility as the Americans lacked resupply and had been constantly shelled if they didn't starve they may well have just broken the snow had returned too causing poor visibility with Americans and Germans frequently Crossing each other's lines in the Merc meanwhile another attack on S vit drove away the last of the American Defenders there although traffic jams faced by the Germans the following day would give the US Army time to regroup and pull back to form a new line the next day marked a turning point the weather finally cleared the skies were suddenly filled with Allied aircraft allowing transport planes to conduct a massive supply drop of ammunition fuel rations and medical supplies all around bestone meanwhile fighter bomber ATT attacks proved extremely effective at breaking up German attacks as they were assembling however General Patton struggled to punch through to bestone and was repeatedly styed by ruined bridges that had been blown up by American Engineers earlier in the battle on the 24th acting chief of the general staff hin garan visited Hitler to argue that the ardan offensive had clearly failed to achieve its goals and was not worth continuing calling instead for renewed attention on the Eastern front Hitler however refused to withdraw he would have been cheered by an apparent German Triumph early that morning when forward elements of the second Panzer Division reached cell this would be the furthest west the Germans would reach during the battle but it would only be a fleeting Victory ammunition and fuel were running dangerously low to the point that even a complete withdraw from their positions had become impossible food 2o was short and by the time the Allied troops had entered cell the following afternoon they encountered only famished and exhausted Panzer troops that night was Rad's turn to inform Hitler the offensive had failed but still the furer refused to order a withdrawal angrily dismissing him on the 26th Patton finally relieved bestone true to form Patton arrived via a reckless charge straight through the asena and North into bestone covered by artillery Fire and Air dropped Napalm it succeeded in driving a hole through German lines allowing troops and tanks from the fourth Armored Division to rushan and relieve the town by this point Hitler no longer made any mention of onp instead bestone was to become his symbol of Victory and he wanted no effort spared in capturing it refusing to listen to the protestations of his commanders Hitler ordered the creation of army group litz out of the remains of his forces to crush the town's def Defenders the Germans launched attack after attack against Bastone but by the beginning of 1945 total Allied air superiority and Relentless American artillery salvos had caused massive casualties German resistance and poor weather slowed the advance and by the 11th of January there were unmistakable signs that the Germans were withdrawing at the end of the month the front line had been more or l less restored to its position before the offensive and the Germans had totally failed to reverse the course of the war and despite inflicting heavy casualties upon the Americans they had only succeeded in delaying the inevitable Japan's fighting Spirit remained tenacious with the Americans forced to contend with displays like that of General yoshitsugu saito's 4,300 man Bonsai charge during the Battle of sipan a ferocious assault which decimated the American 105th Infantry Regiment at the cost of nearly all of its attackers General yamashta defense of the occupied Philippines was crippled by another Naval defeat at the Battle of leate Gulf where the first organized use of kamakazi attacks did little to sway the tide in early February 1945 Roosevelt Churchill and Stalin met at Yalta crafting post-war peace aims and planning the Soviet Union's engagement against Japan as Europe's warfront neared its end the Pacific conflict intensified 1945 marked the final Turning Point as March saw the US launch a firebombing campaign across Tokyo devastating the city's industrial capacity and leaving a death toll of 880,000 to nearly 100,000 people the Allied Forces closing in Japan found itself using all means necessary to defend the home Islands meanwhile Japan's second fleet was thrown at the Allies in a suicidal attack known as operation Teno which promptly failed after having their Naval codes once again decrypted by us intelligence despite a barrage of kamakazi attacks the US fifth Fleet had sunk the Yamoto and five of the other nine ships present at the battle the Americans after a hard-fought victory at iojima turned their focus to okanawa a pivotal point for a potential invasion of the Mainland the Battle of okanawa however proved the deadliest Pacific encounter inflicting over 49,000 American casualties as this battle raged America mourned Roosevelt's death in April with Harry Truman stepping up to the enormous responsibility with Europe breathing relief after Germany's May surrender the Pacific remained a cauldron of conflict Truman was eager to end the war without Soviet involvement and was given the devastating power to do so thanks to the success of the Trinity test on July 16th that month the big three convened in potam the significant outcome was the potam Declaration an ultimatum to Japan surrender or unconditionally face prompt and utter destruction Japan's refusal led to the Fateful decision to drop a atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki compelling Japan to an unconditional surrender by mid August marking the final end of the second world war with the end of the war came the American occupation of Japan from August 1945 to May of 1952 a period of almost 7 years Japan functioned as a colony during this period with no military or political Independence all decisions of the Neutered Japanese government government had to be approved by the United States this was the world into which demobilized Japanese soldiers returned if they did at all the end of the war is usually associated with homecomings and happy reunions but for the Japanese soldier the end of the war meant uncertainty as he made his way back to a Homeland he no longer recognized while the conflict was ongoing the Japanese government made it extraordinarily difficult for captured soldiers to contact their families and propagandists in the military pushed the narrative that surrender was as dishonorable as it was impossible a Japanese soldier was expected to fight to the death and if for some reason he couldn't honor demanded he take his own life to surrender was not only to invite the greatest shame upon yourself but also to horribly dishonor your family and forfeit one's very identity as Japanese to spare their families the shame being ass associated with them returning Japanese PS would often not mention their capture to family and friends hiding what they were told was the most mortifying unforgivable sin they had ever committed in their lives the Western allies had no interest whatsoever in keeping Japanese PS on hand unlike their German counterparts the Japanese were not leas out to reconstruct shattered infrastructure or press ganged to clear minefields the rump Japanese government called for their repatriation and in concert with the Americans had made Provisions for getting the demobilized men home repatriation began in December of 1945 with the sick or wounded ethnic Taiwanese or Koreans and all Japanese soldiers in China pushed to the front of the line the returning soldiers were forced to exchange any foreign money they'd come into for the rapidly crashing Yen but were far more eager to exchange their prison clothes for old uni forms while they waited for their turn to head home they were housed in either old Barracks or warehouses at their ports of entry with basic furniture and no protection from the chill of the Japanese winter conditions were squalid to the point that one returning Soldier noted he wished he'd stay in the Philippines when it came time for the repatriates to complete their Journey they were given enough money for train fair and enough rations to see them through the arrival home was not always a happy one families of PS sometimes wrongly received notices of death an intentional distortion on the government's part so it's easy to imagine the emotional shock of seeing your dead husband brother or son walk through the front door the returning soldiers limped through the streets of their hometowns often still wearing Surplus uniforms given to them by their former captors and sometimes reduced to begging from American troops though many Japanese civili Ians privately supported their returning veterans the loss of the war and overnight restructuring of their society was too fresh of a wound and some soldiers were greeted with outright hostility by these same crowds that once cheered them as Heroes they came home quietly said toru Takaya a high school student at the time some of the soldiers told me that when they left to join the war everyone cheered and sent them off but when they came back there was nothing people looked at them them coldly regardless of how they were received it was all too common for returning soldiers to suffer a psychological collapse and many who made it back to their hometowns simply walked into their homes closed the door and were never seen again during the War years German soldiers were imprisoned in roughly 20 countries around the world including in the continental United States while State Side many German prisoners were were leased out to Farms or factories to serve as laborers providing additional hands to make up for the workers lost to the draft a hot bed of this leasing activity was the southern us where German PS befriended American citizens and watched Hollywood films during their off hours overall PS sent to the US were treated humanely and deaths of Germans in American custody were low at 491 the the war criminals of Nazi Germany from the highest echelons of military and civilian leadership to rank and file guards were arraigned on charges of crimes against humanity and prosecuted at a series of Trials most famously at nurenberg prosecutors from all Allied Nations presented a preponderance of evidence ranging from private Diaries to ledgers of concentration camps to military dispatches the prosecution's point was clear the milit was equally responsible for Hitler's Horrors as the SS and civilian leadership there was no distinction to be drawn between the independent and politically minded SS and the duly enlisted soldiers of the vermos while separate these two cogs in Hitler's machine of annihilation would often work in Sinister concert the vermos would take an area and the SS would Purge it of undesirables Military Officers such as kidle and High ministers like ribbon trop were hanged While others were sentenced to prison terms ranging from life to time served others such as Herman guring took their own lives rather than face the hangman there were even a few female defendants such as the sadistic hyena of aitz Emma CA Caza was ultimately hanged for her brutal treatment of concentration camp inmates unusual for a time when executing women was a stark Rarity but these people were still allowed a defense and theirs was simple we were just following orders the thrust of these arguments was that any Nazi Soldier officer official or Minister accused of crimes against humanity was simply following a directive from a higher authority some in fact falsified orders to show that they had no choice in the matter creating false Paper Trails to justify their own malice and cruelty toward Jews Roma lgbtq people and others the Nazi party declared undesirable many of these false stories were pushed by the defendants families who were tired of the war tired of the Reckoning and just wanted their sons daughters husbands or wives home whether they were a monster or not this attitude began to pervade German public Consciousness with unfortunate results in 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany was founded a new German state for a new German people people the first Chancellor of this new Germany Conrad adenau opened his tenure by announcing plans for a general amnesty for war criminals who had been sentenced by the occupying Powers the desire for Germany to be an ally against possible Soviet aggression trumped the desire for justice and spring of 1950 saw The Advisory board on clemency for war criminals established to review cases for leniency 105 cases were brought to the advis Advisory Board in August of 1950 as family and friends of convicted war criminals as well as representatives of the new German government presented all manner of mitigating evidence from medical history to the newly birthed clean vermos myth which stated emphatically that all Nazi crimes were the fault of the SS and Hitler's Inner Circle proponents of the clean vermos myth argue to this day that the common soldier of Nazi Germany was an honorable chalous man fighting for home and hear untainted by the atrocities of his peers and the hateful rhetoric of his leaders 84 of the 105 cases heard by The Advisory Board were dramatically lessened or outright commuted and the fairy tale myth of the clan verm spread through the German populace generations of Germans believed in a sharp divide between their ancestors who fought for Hitler and his crimes eager to compartmentalize the shame of their nation's atrocities and their own family histories War like history is never simple nor clean the solders of Germany captured on the battlefield rightfully expected to be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention and in many cases they were until the war's end the pragmatic and vindictive moves by the Allies to force German PS into rebuilding Europe do not excuse the crimes of Nazi Germany just as Nazi atrocities do not excuse Allied violations of the Geneva Convention it is imperative that we remember history is not entirely black and white but rather painted Shades of Gray with definite areas of clear morality and Humanity to simplify history into West versus East good versus evil or any dichotomy is to ignore the true lessons our history has to teach us and the most profound lessons are

after the state of Prussia led a triumphant victory over France they and their vast array of neighbors would be unified into the sprawling German Empire an Empire which made of a diverse collection of States as it was now saw the need to join its military under the banner of universal German uniforms the foundation of the newly christened Imperial Soldier was the venrock style dress of the Prussian infantry the Imperial uniform consisted of a refined vafin Rock Woolen coat now with colored cuffs and collar which signified the solders arm of service this was worn with the distinctive pickle Haba helmet now in its simplified and More costeffective m1867 Design The vafin Rock was produced in a number of colors ranging from light or dark blue to green depending on service in 8 1995 it came into its final design receiving smaller buttons as well as the addition of a red piped vent on the tunic's skirt which allowed the wearer access to two rear pockets in the skirts liner The vaen Rock would be replaced in 1907 by the Feld grow or field gray uniform this color was utilized specifically in the field with traditional dark blue uniforms used on all other occasions the heavy wool Feld grow was piped in regiment or service Branch colors with shoulder straps piped in core or unit facing colors two hooks above the Feld gr's rear skirt as well as two additional hooks on the hips were used to properly distribute the weight of the solders belt and equipment by the early 1800s Germany's missionaries and Traders had gained their home country sizable influence outside the borders of Europe coupled with bismar colonial policies of 1884 4 the German foothold in Africa and the Pacific soon bore fruit in the form of colonies and territories which themselves required the managing assistance

Vester hoot or Southwestern hat this was made of gray felt accented by a band in brim in the soldiers Colony color and pinned on the right by an imperial cockade in 1894 the solders Corduroy uniform was given a collar and Cuffs in Colony colors as well the soldier of the expeditionary Corp in China a core which built its ranks of only the best of volunteers also sported a unique uniform he wore a unique Straw Hat The stroo Hoot which resembled the sud Vester Hood the Hat was somewhat unpopular however and was replaced in 1900 first by a khaki board mza field cap then the Navy's 1895 pattern tropical khaki helmet the bortfeld the events of 1914 saw the German Army now nearly a million and a half soldiers strong mobilized across Europe as the bloody first world war came to a head to meet the needs of such an unprecedented war uniforms and equipment were produced and distributed on mass tested tried and constantly revised along the way the changes made to the German soldiers gear over the course of the first world war tell the story of an army which at every step learned to adapt to a harsh and dynamic Battlefield at the war's onset the Imperial Soldier wore the 1907 Feld grow and the newly introduced m1908 great coat he carried the gav 98 rifle alongside a bayonet and Bayonet knot strapped to his m98 short Spade throughout 1915 land were typically the last in line for new equipment but when their turn came around they were furnished with an m1915 a pointed steel headpiece mounted to a leather skull cap this unique helmet was the Forerunner of the m1916 helmet developed in response to the numerous head wounds encountered in trench warfare by 1918 knowledge gained in battle would bring further refinements to these solders headgear outfitting him with the m1918 steel helmet this helmet was given cutouts at the ears allowing for both improved hearing and reduced Echoes at this stage in the war the m191 1516 pattern uniform had become widespread throughout the ranks meanwhile in Germany's colonies sh trupin wore a pocketless uniform known as the T uniform light gray for most all soldiers aside from non-combat officials such as doctors pay masters and gunsmiths who wore versions of this uniform in colors unique to their role after the 1918 Armistice Germany's War torn soldiers returned to the reward of a deposed Kaiser in Exile the upheaval of this new post-war era led to the Imperial Army's disintegration and its replacement by revolutionary soldiers councils German officers responded by creating a force to lay down the law paramilitary units known as fry cor by 1919 many fry Corps members were integrated into the new reiches bringing with them the skills they had once used in quelling revolutionary fervor at this time the Feld Rock m1920 became the standard for all German soldiers and it would hold that distinction until the Nazis came to power the matching m1920 field cap would also be used until 1935 seeing only minor changes along the way this hat bore a golden oval emblazoned with the viar Republic Eagle though this was eventually replaced by the black white red Cade of the Third Reich as the Nazi party began adding their own insignias to the German soldiers dress as the Nazis transitioned the reiches fair into the Vermont their focus turned toward establishing their look so to speak most notably this period saw the creation of the infamous SS uniform this consisted of a black open collared m1932 Dino jacket embellished with its characteristic nsdap arm band on the left sleeve and a black and white Twisted cord epulet worn on the right shoulder this uniforms belt buckle featured an SS eagle and swastika as well as the text Mina era Heist trya or my honor is loyalty the rigid peaked hat was adorned with the ominous combination of a death's head badge and the SS eagle and swastika the verm soldier of 1936 in many ways resembled his reiches fair predecessor with his B Blues a tunic still bearing the field gray wool of the traditional uniform with only minor modifications in tow looking ahead to the mechanized Warfare these soldiers would be involved in Germany tailored the uniform with a shorter skirt and a more form-fitting design perfect for a soldier who would spend much of his time on the move the Feld blua tunic kept standard until the end of the second world war also featured an internal suspension system which allowed the soldier to hang his equipment belt on a series of exterior hooks connected to two straps inside the lining this spread out the weight of the equipment without the use of suspenders the solders helmet the m1935 stalh helm was also improved thanks to a new leather suspension and modifications to its construction this helmet was lighter safer and more comfortable for the individual Soldier the dawn of the second world war was marked by the Vermont's lightning quick strikes against the surrounding Nations allowing them them to plant their boots in new territories day by day this powerful opening round of the war was won by Germany's characteristic adaptations to new Battlefield conditions now a vital skill as the German war machine sent its soldiers everywhere from the scorching heat of North Africa to the snowstorms of Russia with this need to adapt came a number of functional and symbolic changes to the German solders uniform and equipment making their designs lighter more streamlined and even more tailored to the Contemporary Battlefield the m1940 uniform was the first update to the standard vermo soldiers outfit with the bottle Green Collar and straps being traded out for Fel gr more substantial changes came in 1943 as the m1943 Feld bla was often stripped of its internal suspension system as the war progressed the Vermont's uniforms began to be made of of Cheaper lower quality materials 1944 brought major cost cutting updates with the m44 pattern uniform the first serious departure from the typical German uniform since 1936 this uniform was characterized by its shortened skirt now coming only to the waist and by its unique color a drab greenish Brown known as Feld grow 44 this uniform was field tested by the elite Panzer Lair division before it was generally issued though at this late St age in the war it was really only seen on the greenest troops for assault operation support Germany employed paratroopers known as falam Jagger who added to the standard uniform a parachutist jump badge and m1938 fimer helmet and jump boots this Soldier initially wore a helmet designed to prevent its falling in his face and obscuring his vision during a jump however by the late War newer falam Jaggers had begun wearing stalh Helms covered by string Nets which allowed for the addition of silhouette breaking twigs and leaves to the helmet further late War changes were made to the falam Jagger's gear but the most notable of these was his adoption of the unique fg42 assault rifle in response to the hot weather of North African combat the Africa core wore M40 tropical tunics which differed from standard dress in that the collar and lapels were open and made of a mediumweight cotton twill this fabric was issued in olive drab but over the course of service faded to khaki this tunic could also be worn with a neck tie though soldiers often went without following its surrender in the second world war the now split Germany could finally begin a cautious remilitarization for Soviet aligned East Germany this meant establishing a military reminiscent police force know known as the folks poai in 1945 and for us aligned West Germany their own police force the buis Clenz came in 1951 these twin pushes toward reestablishing Germany's armed security serve as a valuable point of reference for both post-war politics in a divided Cold War Germany as well as the continuance of the nation's focus on putting their combat knowledge to work in the designs of their soldiers kit the adapting game was played again when Hitler invaded the USSR and the Germans were met with battle against Marshall mud and general winter while initially unprepared in the latter months of 1941 the Germans quickly sprang into action even on the home front as civilians donated fur coats and winter clothing until the Army could furnish their soldiers with the needed cold weather gear this would come in the form of hooded waterproof parkas white for the Eastern front and field gry for Mountain units weather resistant though very heavy this uniform is considered one of the first modern combat suits and is the standard worldwide today the vafin SS the military branch of the SS served first as Hitler's personal bodygard before entering active combat as they shifted into their new role their equipment and uniforms followed suit with aspects such as function and the desire for a look distinct from the Vermont shaping their dress their 1942 new to 1943 winter uniform especially showed signs of expert design consisting of a padded parka with a fur-lined hood and mittens with separate thumbs and trigger fingers in the last winters of the war their equipment took a number of hits due to the supply shortages with the soldiers leather shoulder braces being replaced by webbing and their magazines now made of lowquality synthetic materials all varying in color and finish in addition to the German SS units an array of foreign Legions joined with the vafin SS sometimes retaining SS Insignia but at other times adding aspects of their home country's uniforms to it the uniform of the British free Corps for example bore both a Nazi eagle and a Union Jack while some soldiers of the free Indian Legion wore headwear like the turban from the moment the territory of East Germany was secured by the Soviets they began forming their plan for secretly reestablishing an armed force in the country hoping to reap the benefits without worrying the Western allies this was the Genesis of the kasera folks poai otherwise known as the kvp the uniform of the kvp soldier mixed both the familiar and the new suited up in war Surplus such as the blue m1948 tunic or the green m954 but with added elements unique to their new Branch notably their m1943 style field caps marked with the kvp Insignia on the west German side of the aisle was the bundis cleans shortz or bgs early on this unit struggled to gain uniforms in its early days so like their Eastern counterparts repurposed uniforms became the standard in the early 1950s the bgs soldier wore the fur green fueld blouse of the vero's light infantry and armored troops as well as a likewise repurposed field cap now with a new Cade in 1952 this hat was replaced with a dark green oldstyle peaked cap Now emblazened with an eagle an oak leaf wreath and the federal Cade from its Beginnings the bundes fair also repurposed war uniforms utilizing both vermo camo and US M1 helmets their olive green uniform with its Black Tie was initially used for privates but was later expanded to the main field uniform for the force the bundes Lu Fafa soldier in particular was set apart by the distinguishing band around his arm and the wing badge on his [Music] cap continuing tradition the main service uniform of the naala folks Army held a strong family resemblance to the Vermont uniform in addition to his gray tunic the folks arm Soldier wore a jacket and trousers initially in the tar and muster camouflage but eventually updated to a strikar camouflage for headgear he wore either a field cap service cap or m56 steel helmet in the winter this uniform was topped with a quilted padded suit and greay knit gloves and the soldiers hat choices narrowed to a fur pile cap or a steel helmet on November 10th 1989 the Berlin Wall fell marking the long awaited reunification of Germany in the meantime however the Cold War had come and gone and the bundes faar's now outdated equipment was in dire need of an upgrade with the lifting of the arms restrictions which had previously styed the German military the nation was once again free to equip its soldiers for the modern era shaping them into a force soon to be worthy of the 21st century the bundes soldier of the newly reunited Germany wore the standard flectar camun Nick and trousers and in 1992 received his first piece of new gear in the gex helm M92 combat helmet he carried the gav 3 or G3 rifle which held the position of the bundes faar's main service rifle from 1959 to 1996 additional overhauls came in 1997 Furnishing the soldier with Bristol body armor and a Heckler and HK G36 the Commando spal CA operators or ksk was established in response to Germany's inability to help evacuate their citizens to safety during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide throughout the late 1990s the ksk engaged in anti-terror operations across Europe and Beyond soldiers of this unit carried the exclusive HK G8 machine gun as well as the HK MP5K submachine gun their uniforms mirrored those of the Contemporary bundes with the main identification points of a ksk soldier being his unique equipment at the turn of the Millennium the bundes uniform would go through further changes in 2005 its camouflage became noticeably muted and it would also be upgraded with a flak vest intended to protect the soldier from shrapnel and low velocity projectiles upon deployment to Afghanistan the soldier would wear tropical tropentarn camouflage wherever he fought he typically carried the hkg36 or the modern hkg36 A2 in 2021 the mailer Mast vest was adopted as the standard replacement over the long-running mailer St armored vest at the same time the balt skin Viper helmet was adopted at first as merely interim headgear but following the breakout of the war in Ukraine this helmet became standard as well replacing the HK G36 type rifles was the hk46 A7 assault rifle also known as the g95 K with its long history of modernization and adaptation in both combat and peace it comes as no surprise to see the German military of today continuing to mold its equipment to the shape of the modern era with each stitching each helmet and rifle we see that Innovation continues to shape The

Korean War provided lessons that would help them begin modernizing their army this process began with a reform program aimed at transforming the Army into a force capable of Defending China and its neighbor from what they saw as Western influence following the Soviet model these reforms included institutional changes command centralization improvements in technology strategy and even the formation of a nuclear program by the late 1960s China's alliance with the Soviet Union had fallen apart as the Soviets were viewed with increasing suspicion in regards to National Security as border clashes broke out between the two blocks other countries like India and Vietnam found themselves challenging Chinese territorial claims which in turn LED China to a rapid expansion of personnel numbers that ballooned over 6 million the highest point in its history existing strategies for China's defense at first relied on attrition and Guerilla Warfare against Invaders like the Soviet Union but by the 1980s the pla changed their strategy toward a more aggressive and mechanized approach this shift toward mechanization and high maneuverability in the field was given further support by military planners in the 1990s who had witnessed its potential in American demonstrations during the Gulf War and Taiwan straight crisis since its formation a key distinction of the people's Liberation Army compared to other military forces is its direct subordination to the Chinese Communist Party rather than the state in effect this makes the goals of the state and the party essentially the same the 2019 Chinese white paper highlights this distinction noting that the pla is entrusted with providing strategic support for consolidating the leadership of the CCP and the Socialist System since becoming president in 2012 XI Shing ping has pushed several pla reforms to assist the party in achieving what he calls the the Chinese dream hoping to transform China into a great power these changes haven't come without their problems however the last time China fought a war was in 1979 meaning that it lacks any real Modern Combat experience China may have significantly modernized and expanded its Arsenal since the 70s but it hasn't been able to reliably test any of these new weapons in the field leaving many of their capabilities technically unproven furthermore pla training and exercises have also been criticized for being overs scripted and failing to simulate realistic combat conditions more recent steps have been taken to improve training but only time will tell if these are effective still both the CCP and the military have a plan in place as per the most recent Chinese white paper the pla's defense strategy covers a range of priorities which include safeguarding National sovereignty containing independent movements and securing interests over Maritime rights cyber security and even outer space of these duties the most controversial is their opposition of Taiwanese Independence and the containment of the Taiwanese movement throughout the globe for the Communist party this is important as the Taiwanese question feeds directly into the protection of Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan and other territories throughout the South China Sea part of this requires China military to be capable of carrying out active defense a long-term strategy that is defensive at the Strategic level of War but often offensive at the operational and tactical levels the Chinese intervention in Korea against the US is an example of this defensive measure in action in more recent years the military buildup and aggressive presence in the South China Sea is another example of China exercising this active defense for the sake of national sovereignty China has undoubtedly made huge strides in enhancing its power projection capabilities nevertheless it's essential to acknowledge that it currently falls short of matching the power projection standards of global Giants such as the United States one key area where China faces limitations is in its strategic airlift and aerial refueling capabilities which significantly lag behind those of the US China's aircraft carrier Fleet is still in its developmental stages lacking the extensive operational experience and strength of its American counterparts economically China's influence continues to expand across regions like Central Asia Africa and Latin America but its military power limits China's reach only to its immediate vicinity making it predominantly a regional military player at this stage another distinction that makes the pla somewhat unique is in the name itself the people's Liberation Army although containing the word Army actually encompasses the entire Chinese military under this system each of the military's five main branches are designated as within the pla it's an approach that exemplifies China's commitment to a unified military strategy and helps reflect its principle of being the armed wing of the Chinese Communist Party first and foremost the oldest of these branches is the ground force equivalent to a traditional Army also known as the pl agf its basic operational structure starts with the group Army operating much like a core in other armies but with more flexibility and responsiveness in Mind Group armies are assigned to one of China's theater commands each controlling 12 Brigade sized organizations six being combined arms brigades and the other six being support brigades of the two the combined arms brigades make up the bulk of the pla agf's combat power as each Brigade utilizes roughly four to six battalions featuring integrated artillery air defense headquarters and Logistics units since the mechanization that began in the 1980s the once immense Personnel numbers of the ground force have shrunk by 55% leaving an active total of around 975,000 troops under current conditions the ground force is responsible for both domestic and Multinational security ensuring stability and engaging in rescue or disaster relief operations when called upon the plf possesses a large stockpile of military equipment which has been rapidly modernizing over the past several years they are estimated to maintain over 4,800 main battle tanks with the most common being the second generation type 96 and 96a supplemented by a number of the newest third generation type 99a tanks the ground force also operates around 7,700 type 04 and type 08 infantry fighting vehicles and a host of other equipment from apcs to assault guns and attack helicopters the people's Liberation Army Air Force or plaaf is China's Air Service branch responsible for the pla's combat air power originally tasked with interception and air defense the plaaf has expanded considerably in recent years transitioning into a Strategic Air Force C capable of defensive and offensive operations with both happening at increasing distances from the Chinese Mainland as time goes on these operations can be attributed to its overall size despite other branches such as the Naval Air arm or ground forces Fielding their own assortment of air assets it is the plaaf that constitutes the third largest Air Force in the world still even with these advances the Air Force's limited capabilities outside of Chinese airspace means that they are far less concerned with air dominance than the Americans for the plaaf simply denying airspace to an adversary is considered adequate to enforce their boundaries the Air Force operates a wide variety of aircraft totaling 2566 airframes these include a multitude of bombers Fighters multi-roll and specialized aircraft with the total strength of the plaf being estimated at around 395,000 Personnel while these statistics can be staggering it is important to note that the pla equipment numbers are constantly changing and can be subject to a fair amount of guesswork in some cases despite the resources available this is also the case for their operational reliability just because China maintains a certain number of systems on paper does not always mean that they can operate that many systems in the field equipment or vehicle Les sitting in unprotected storage may be accounted for but it hardly makes them operational the pla's third and arguably more relevant Branch due to their Maritime activities is the people's Liberation Army Navy or plan it comprises five distinct service arms including surface submarine coastal defense Naval Aviation and the Marine Corps this formidable Naval force is strategically organized into three fleets each assigned to the southern Eastern and Northern theater commands the naval surface combatants constitute a substantial chunk of the pl Arsenal totaling 92 primary vessels which include two aircraft carriers with a third in development seven Cruisers 42 destroyers and 41 frigs Additionally the Navy maintains a fleet of 142 Patrol and Coastal combat vessels along with 11 large amphibious assault ships and 109 Landing ships of varying sizes the Navy's submarine force is a formidable component with 59 submarines in operation 12 of which are nuclear powered while historically dominant recent modernization efforts have shifted focus elsewhere leaving submarine capabilities trailing behind their American counterparts in general the Navy has been constructing new ships at a rapid Pace making it the largest Navy in the world in terms of sheer numbers but possesses less than half of the tonnage of the US Navy on average this means that Chinese ships tend to be smaller than their American counterparts US Navy ships also carry more than twice as many offensive missiles however it should be noted that in any engagement close to Chinese Waters like Taiwan China could deploy significant numbers of groundbased anti-ship missiles to potentially narrow this Gap tasked with the defense of China's territorial Waters the plan has more recently put increasing emphasis on Blue Water capabilities further abroad such as in the Indian Ocean with anti-piracy patrols conducted in the Gulf of Aiden since 2008 and the more recent opening of its first overseas base in jibuti in 2017 assisting this strategy is the pl's expanded Personnel numbering around 260,000 Sailors complemented by 26,000 Naval Aviation experts and 35,000 dedicated Marines notably the Naval Aviation arm of the Navy remains relatively nent both in terms of capabilities and Doctrine these aviators mainly operate carrier-based j15 Fighters which are navalized aircraft based on Soviet designs an emerging strategy which is still evolving as the Navy comes to terms with their air arm potential beyond the three main branches two other services contribute equally important duties to the military one of these is the people's Liberation Army rocket force or pla RF which is responsible for overseeing China's groundbased ballistic missiles this includes responsibility over much of the nuclear Arsenal though the CCP maintains a no first-use nuclear policy which stresses the use of nuclear weapons only in self-defense and that they would not be used to instigate a nuclear conflict in general China does not publicly share the size of its nuclear Arsenal so it is impossible to know for sure the number of warheads it possesses many estimates put the size of the nuclear stockpile between 200 and 400 devices in terms of personnel the total strength of the rocket force is estimated to be over 120,000 alongside the plf the military's fifth Branch includes the Strategic support force or ssf which was established during the military reforms of Xi Jinping the exact role of the Strategic support Force has been kept vague by official Chinese sources an example of this is the ongoing debate on whether the ssf represents a full service branch of the pla or a subservice branch this also means that their exact role within the military is somewhat murky outside observers are confident that the ssf is primarily engaged in space and information operations including cyber electronic and psychological warfare operations the known assets of the ssf include just four hesen class cutter ships used mainly for missile and satellite tracking the total strength of ssf personnel is estimated to be around 175,000 lastly is a lesser known subservice of the military known as The Joint Logistics support force or jlsf this branch of the pla was also created during XI Shing Ping's most recent reforms and was tasked with unifying and facilitating the logistic challenges of the pla's numerous branches historically the pla has struggled with significant corruption throughout all of its military levels and it remains a problem which hinders the organization today while shiing Ping's reforms attempt to address these issues through branches like the jlsf the process of reorganization itself has led to its own problems the expediency and pressure of these reforms have led to significant disruption across all of the PLA and some experts fear that Growing Pains associated with reorganization will impact China's combat Readiness for some time nevertheless the jlf's main duties include reducing redundancies and generally increasing efficiency within the pla's immense bureaucracy while the jlsf does handle some logistics for all of the pla's branches this is mostly just at the theater level and Individual Services still remain in charge of their more localized logis itics given the size of the pla it's natural for many flaws and issues to surface in full view of China's opposition but as a military force the pla also boasts numerous strengths as of 2022 the pla's official budget was around $242 billion making it the second best funded military in the world however the official budget does not fully highlight the money being spent on defense their biggest Vantage comes in the level of purchasing power over Nations such as the us or Russia giving them more bang for their Buck on military spending the past several years have seen the pla carry out increasingly aggressive exercises and Maneuvers near Taiwan pla forces have also acted increasingly boldly around the entire indopacific region as China gains increasing confidence in their military forces these displays of Power are likely to increase perhaps more concerningly for the West China has also rapidly modernized and expanded its nuclear Arsenal if the pla continues at its current Pace China could soon possess as many as 1,500 Warheads the year 2027 marks a significant milestone for the pla as China aims to complete a pivotal phase in its modernization efforts this phase encompasses The crucial objectives of mechanization informationization and intelligentization within the pla's ranks as the ground force looks to complete its mechanization it will likely continue to get smaller but will grow increasingly flexible and mobile as motorized infantry and Tow artillery become fully mechanized also likely is that individual unit sizes will shrink the Navy will likely continue to grow despite concerns of ships aging and requiring more maintenance becoming increasingly capable of acting outside of China's territory torial Waters inure defense capabilities will also be maintained consisting of small attack boats and groundbased missiles to deter potential Invasion forces the Air Force will likely reduce the number of air superiority Fighters it possesses focusing instead on more multi-roll aircraft and bombers from its humble beginnings in the Chinese Civil War Ma's Red Army has transformed into a military Juggernaut making it not only the Lar lest in the world but also the fastest modernizing force today it's widely speculated that the pla considers this phase of modernization as vital potentially influencing any future actions related to Taiwan and the Pacific the final stages of modernization are set to conclude by 2049 thanks again to holar for sponsoring

       " \" the year is 1876 and Mexico has been in chaos for over 50 years after gaining its independence in 1821 the Mexican state had been embroiled in numerous Wars against the Spanish Americans and French and had seen a revolving door of leaders who often violently toppled their predecessors this half century of turmoil would leave Mexico in Ruins financially destitute and missing over half of its territory but by 187 6 Mexico was ready to rebuild with the Ascension of poerio Diaz to the presidency in the fall of that year Mexico would see its first stable ruler since Independence beginning an era that would reap much needed rewards for the baguer nation while also sowing the seeds of future conflict poerio Diaz was a Mexican General who in keeping with Mexican tradition violently overthrew the us-backed liberal government that preceded him even though Diaz had taken the presidency through Force of Arms he did legitimately win the subsequent election of 1877 promising to put an end to despotic rule in Mexico Diaz amended the Mexican constitution soon after taking office to ban the reelection of presidents in the country seemingly keeping his promise Diaz stepped down from the presidency in 1880 Mexico appeared to be taking its first steps toward legitimate democracy but not everything was as it seemed Manuel Gonzalez the man who succeeded Diaz as president turned out to be little more than a puppet for the former ruler who would return to power himself in 1884 breaking his own ban against reelection the media Scandal that followed may have proved problematic for lesser politicians but for Diaz the solution was simple enough he threw the press in jail and legalized Unlimited re-elections in the end poerio Diaz would rule Mexico for over 30 years while he stayed in power through unsavory means Diaz's presidency was not uniformly bad for Mexico under his rule Mexico's oil textile and Mining Industries blossomed and foreign investment poured into the country Mexican industry was further aided by explosive growth of the railroad which occurred under Diaz's supervision this extra economic activity allowed Diaz to pay off Mexico's external debt which had plagued the nation since its founding Diaz also oversaw the reconciliation of the Mexican state church and land owners whose distaste for each other had led to conflicts in the

it also curtailed the power of individual Mexican states displeasing many local Elites from the perspective of Everyday People Di's Reign also had issues as it saw the massive expansion of acendas large rural Estates that pushed Mexican peasants off their land and compelled them to work as unskilled laborers additionally even though the foreign investment that Diaz attracted helped Mexico grow economically it also meant that very little of Mexico's industry was actually owned by Mexicans one by one as these tensions mounted Mexico inched ever closer to a breaking point that Breaking Point finally came in 1910 after Diaz who had previously announced that he would be stepping down from the presidency promptly changed his mind and jailed the leader of the opposition Francisco Madero unfortunately for Diaz Madero a weal wealthy landowner and Son of a governor managed to escape to the United States temporarily out of Diaz's reach Madero called for the Mexican people to rise up on November 20th 1910 the day the Mexican Revolution had begun in the north of the country Madero joined forces with poncho via a former Bandit and horse thief and began fighting against federal troops in the South peasant revolutionary ailano zapada began his own Rebellion inspired by madero's Promises of land redistribution in this increasingly hostile environment Federal forces faced numerous defeats at the hands of Madero via and sapata motivating Diaz to step down to prevent further Bloodshed exiling himself to France in May of 1911 soon after Diaz's departure Madera was elected president of Mexico after less than a year of fighting the age of poerio Diaz had been brought to an end this bright new age of Mexican history ran into problems almost immediately while Madero and much of the middle class wanted electoral and economic reforms they did not want extreme Revolution however madero's hope for a limited revolution had become increasingly untenable as Decades of simmering discontent boiled over and the revolution began to slip out of his control in his call for Revolution in 1910 Madero had Promised Land redistribution to the poor but with armed Farmers now roaming much of the Mexican Countryside Madero demanded that the peasants disarm before any land distribution went forward this perceived betrayal was taken especially poorly by Amano Zapata Who Rose up against Madero in 1912 in response Madero would send one of his generals victoriano WEA to put down Zapata's Rebellion which would prove easier said than done by early 1913 with battles still raging against Zapata in the South and the chaos of the Revolution still uncontained support for Madero began to falter the United States began to worry that the instability in Mexico would be dangerous for their business interests in the country and began to wonder if their interests would be better served if someone else was in charge someone like victoriano wera as it turns out WEA didn't need much convincing in an agreement signed at the US Embassy in Mexico City the United States and WEA agreed that Madera would be deposed in a coup which ended up leading to the death of Mexico's first revolutionary Madera was gone and WEA now assumed the Mexican presidency all according to plan what was not according to plan was where Do's alcoholism and poor administrative skills this unfortunate combination of traits led to vocal opposition to his rule almost immediately Chief among these critics was venustiano coranza the governor of the state of Kila on March 26th 1913 coranza went from critic to Rebel when he called for the removal of weera and launched an armed Uprising from his base in the north of the country in this endeavor karanza was joined by Poncho via who had spent the previous years amassing a sizable force and newcomer Alvaro abreon Who was appointed by K a to lead his army in the north with the addition of Zapata's peasant Army in the South this new revolutionary Alliance sought to surround WEA and forcibly remove him from power in more bad news for WEA the United States despite backing his original coup less than a year prior switched sides and threw in their lot with kona's Alliance weera was slowly being backed into a corner but he wasn't defeated yet and fierce fighting continued into 1914 wera's situation soon grew untenable however as American troops occupied the port of verac Cruz following a diplomatic dispute and karanza Via aurion and zapada closed in on Mexico City under this immense pressure WEA would resign on June 15th 1914 and flee into Exile ironically into the United States with WEA gone the revolutionary leaders now had to decide how they would rule Mexico coranza as the instigator of the Rebellion took the risk of declaring himself president-elect but in order to reduce tensions also called for a meeting where via abrion zabata and him could all discuss their differences however this meeting was destined to fail via and zapada who came from poorer backgrounds than karanza and abrion wanted immediate social programs and agrarian reforms to Plate their largely peasant following on the other hand coranza and abon favored more long-term political reforms these differences proved impossible to reconcile and the alliance between the four men shattered with via and Zapata launching yet another Insurrection with the aim of toppling karanza and his ally abrion rapid advances by via and Zapata's rebelling forces press coranza and aurion to abandon Mexico's City and flee to verac Cruz which by this point had been vacated by the Americans by December 1st of 1914 Zapata and Via had entered Mexico City but neither of them felt qualified to govern the country and they wasted precious time deciding on a course of action which allowed coranza and aurion to regroup and take back the capital the following months would be characterized by brutal fighting in the center of the country although neither side managed to achieve a significant breakthrough this would change during the second half of 1915 in the South coranza sent forces to combat Zapata's peasant bands and slowly began pushing Zapata back to his home state of Morelos on the Northern front abrion warded off an offensive by via near the town of salaya abrion a skilled General was well prepared for via's now famous frontal Cavalry attacks and fortified his positions with barbed wire and machine gun nests tactics reminiscent of the then ongoing first world war auberon would then go on to defeat V in two more battles forcing the horse thief turned revolutionary to retreat to his home turf in northern Mexico his army shattered via blamed his predicament on the Americans who had been backing caransa and aurion for some time in retaliation via LED an expedition against the US attacking the Border Town of Columbus New Mexico after a short Skirmish both via and the now enraged Americans claimed Victory a day after the raid American president presid woodro Wilson dispatched General John persing to hunt down Poncho via despite the superiority of the American forces via LED persing on a wild goose chase across northern Mexico and evaded capture eventually forcing the Americans to return home empty-handed despite this apparent Victory via was no longer the force he used to be and soon took a back seat in the conflict leaving his iance with zapada and containing himself in his home state of Chihuahua with his power seeming increasingly secure coranza drafted a new Mexican constitution in 1917 the first in the world to set out social rights such as the 8-hour work day maternity leave and the right to strike coranza scored a further victory in 1919 when he successfully assassinated Amano zapada bringing an end to his Reb rebellion in the South though small scale fighting was still ongoing throughout Mexico coranza appeared to be nearing total Victory however as coranza was securing notable political victories and consolidating his power he also began to alienate his closest Ally alvero abreon abreon had been put off by many of Coran's reforms and felt like he was being gradually pushed to the sidelines of Mexican Politics the final straw came in 1920 when coranza chose to nominate an obscure Diplomat as his chosen successor instead of aurion this slight proved too much for aurion who promptly launched what proved to be the final coup of the Mexican Revolution with the Army at his back aurion stormed Mexico City forcing coranza to flee to verac Cruz once again however arrian's former Ally would never reach his destination somewhere along the road to verac Cruz coranza was shot the exact circumstances of his death are still debated today Alo abrian would rule Mexico from 1920 to 1924 before turning over power to a trusted Ally just as he wished coranza had done during his rule abrian would pass numerous reforms and provide the country with much needed stability after years of Bloodshed rumors spread that he was behind the assassination of a retired rancher in northern Mexico by the name of Poncho via of the four revolutionaries of 19 13 only aurion remained this dubious honor was not to last however as aurion himself would be assassinated just a few years later by a disgruntled Catholic fanatic a violent end to a violent revolution in the decade of Bloodshed more than a million Mexicans had lost their lives the immense human tragedy of the Revolution also drove countless Mexicans to flee to the United States in search of safety and a better life political developments of the Mexican Revolution would also continue to reverberate into the modern era after his assassination in 1928 Alvaro abon's allies would form a political party that would come to be known as The Pri ruling Mexico until the year 2000 perhaps most importantly though Coran's constitution of 1917 not only served as inspiration for both viar Germany and the Soviet Union's own documents but it continues to be used in Mexico to this day so with every politician sworn in every law passed and every vote counted the legacy of the Mexican Revolution lives on\",\n",
       " \" as the ongoing war in Ukraine has shown drones have become an inescapable part of modern warfare and it has become impossible to imagine a future conflict without them throughout history humans have launched all manner of objects into the skies above but some of the first attempts at doing so in a controlled manner occurred during the first world war hoping to break the stalemate on the front lines through long-ranged aerial bombardment the United stes Army worked on a device known as the ketering bug an unmanned aerial torpedo considered to be the Forerunner of the modern cruise missile various militaries would continue experimenting with unmanned aerial vehicles or uavs throughout the first half of the 20th century notably the British and American Air Forces developed several radiocontrol drones that were used as targets to train anti-aircraft Gunners Nazi Germany and fascist Italy also made use of several radi guided vehicles with the Germans in particular introducing Vehicles like the Argos 292 into active service by the Cold War unmanned uavs were increasingly used to conduct reconnaissance missions over hostile territory the desire to use drones for such missions increased dramatically after the Downing of a man You2 spy plane over the Soviet Union in 1960 during the Vietnam war drones such as the Ryan model 147 lightning bug were used extensively for reconnaissance and as decoys that Drew attention away from manned aircraft overall it's estimated that drones conducted over 3,000 flights throughout the Vietnam War Israel also made extensive use of uavs during their numerous conflicts throughout the 1960s and 1970s with drone reconnaissance playing a pivotal role in their success against Egypt and Syria the latter half of the 20th century saw drones such as the AI rq2 Pioneer used for reconnaissance by the US during the Gulf War notably the golf War marked the first instance of human soldiers surrendering to an unmanned platform drones were also used during the air campaign over Iraq as decoys tricking Iraqi air defenses into switching on their Radars which were then locked onto by radar seeking missiles launched from coal aircraft soon however drones no longer needed crude aircraft for lethal assistance on February 16th 2001 the US Air Force successfully launched its first drone-mounted Hellfire missile over a bombing range in Nevada this marked the first time that a reusable UAV was offensively armed and marked a turning point in drone Warfare the us-led war on terror marked the start of modern drone drone Warfare drones went from doing recon to providing close air support in missions across Afghanistan and Iraq it was during the war on terror that the Drone also gained a measure of infamy thanks to its extensive use in Precision strikes on specific targets believed to be of strategic significance the lack of any pilots on board effectively removed the human risk factor which in turn greatly reduced the Diplomatic risk of a mission these two advantages worked together to allow Global actors such as the United States to use drones much more brazenly than Mann aircraft from the 2000s to the 2010s drones were usually used by stronger conventional powers on much weaker opponents however in the second negoro carabat war of 2020 showed how uavs could be used in a war between opponents of more equal power in this conflict both Armenia and aeran had uavs but aeran stood out by using their drones more aggressively especially the Turkish barakar tb2 these drones were used very effectively against Armenian armor and artillery helping further tip the conflict's balance in azer Ban's favor importantly azan's success in this war proved that uavs could be successfully deployed against opponents with relatively modern air defenses however even though drones were highly effective the conflict in negoro carabat did not prove that they were capable of winning conventional Wars by themselves asan's Superior military meant that drones only reinforced existing advantages Armenian air defense strategy was arguably poor and could have performed better under different leadership and most importantly the use of drones did not eliminate the need for ground combat as azerai forces still took relatively heavy losses big thanks to the sponsor of today's video War Thunder the most

neither Armenia or aeran could be considered Global superpowers but when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 the world was exposed to the full force of modern drone Warfare once again drones showed their effectiveness against modern air defenses during the Russian push to keev Ukraine released video footage of tb2 drones destroying Russian armor and even surfac to- a missile launchers however like the Armenians poor Russian strategy during the opening weeks played a key role in Ukrainian successes in fact as the war dragged on Russian air defenses changed their tactics leading to the almost complete withdrawal of tb2 from close air support missions now large Ukrainian drones such as the tb2 are used primarily for reconnaissance missions and kept out of range of Russian air defenses the tb2 and other large drones are hardly the only uavs available to Russia and Ukraine although small commercially available drones have been converted into weapons of War as early as 2016 the war in Ukraine has seen these cheap drones used on a scale never before seen compact uavs are often used to provide reconnaissance at a tactical level as well as for limited offensive actions like having grenades attached to them for use as an improvised bomber these drones size and profile make them hard to detect with traditional air defense Radars programmed to track larger targets their quantity and ease of production also mean that these drones are easily replaced with the Munitions used to shoot down these drones sometimes being more expensive than the Drone itself of the methods to combat small drones the most effective so far has been electronic warfare which can scramble the GPS of the Drone or cut it off from its operator in Ukraine electronic warfare along with other techniques leads to the loss of up to 10,000 Ukrainian drones per month however these drones are so cheap that Ukraine just buys more the war in Ukraine has seen the use of drones on a previously unheard of scale thousands of metallic Warriors struggle in the skies and seas of the embattled nation and it seems like every day brings a new story of the creative use of uavs but the war in Ukraine groundbreaking as it is only scratches the surface of drones potential in future conflicts on the sea 2o drones have made themselves increasingly present on the Ukrainian Battlefield Ukrainian sea drones have conducted numerous attacks on Russian warships and ports and are alleged to have been behind the most recent damaging of the Kirch straight bridge between Russia and Crimea with the tragic ending of the Black Sea grain initiative Seaborn drones will likely become an even bigger fixture in this ongoing conflict perhaps the most significant area of future drone development is artificial intelligence or AI when applied to Modern drones AI has proven capable of following basic commands but it is not as successful as adapting to new threats or considering larger strategic concerns the first truly autonomous drones will likely take on a surveillance role as this is far less risky and politically fraught than arming an autonomous drone with weapons and empowering it to carry out strike missions the first autonomous drones will likely not operate fully outside of human control the United States for example has committed to keeping humans involved in any decision to take life reassurances aside it might prove difficult to limit the use of AI in tomorrow's drones some experts have envisioned a not so distant future where quick-thinking AI powered drones could rapidly overwhelm a nation's nuclear launch capab abilities with humans being too slow to react some fear that Nations might Place their nuclear weapons in the hands of AI taking the destruction of humankind out of human hands this situation isn't necessarily likely but it illustrates some of the potential risks of unchecked artificial intelligence in drones deeply related to AI another direction of drone development is the concept of swarming modern drone swarms are nothing more than remote operated uavs acting in formations but a proper drone swarm could use artificial intelligence to allow individual drones to behave autonomously while also coordinating its actions with the larger group if used effectively these swarms could prove incredibly lethal a swarm of tiny drones could travel over a wide area making them almost impossible to detect then too quickly for anyone to react these undetected drones could converge at the last minute and overwhelm a Target through sheer numbers through their use of AI swarms would be able to react to threats without human intervention meaning that human operators would simply assign a Target and the Swarm would take care of the rest over 100 original videos can be found on our website ahtv use code drone 50 for 50% off your first month China is currently speculated to lead the world in swarming technology Chinese research and development has been able to field swarms of up to a thousand drones though only for non-combat aial shows experts believe that these swarms are being designed to overwhelm American command centers in the South China Sea potentially giving China a crucial advantage in the opening stages of any potential move on Taiwan despite future technological advances it's unlikely that a chat GPT controlled drone swarm will completely replace humans in future conflicts in fact drones and humans will likely work closer together than ever before the concept of manned unmanned pairing envisions a human pilot controlling both a crude aircraft and several drones that will function as extensions of the aircraft's capabilities the US military is currently experimenting with having Apache helicopter Pilots control Gray Eagle drones which could be used as an extension of the Apache weapon system and allow for the destruction of targets much further away than currently possible the US Air Force's next Generation air dominance fighter or ngad is likely to take this concept even further rather than a traditional fighter aircraft the ngad fighter might be closer in size to a modern bomber and act as a mobile drone control center with many of its offensive weapons carried by uavs surrounding the aircraft the larger size of the aircraft as well as its personal Squadron of drones will give the US's sixth generation Fighter the range necessary to effectively fight over the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea a region that the US increasingly sees as a future Battleground beneath future Skies drones are also expected to play larger roles on the sea and land on land specifically drones could find use as pack animals of sorts current products are either too noisy or not mobile enough enough but in the future these autonomous drones could accompany squads of infantry and greatly increase their carrying capacity since the Infantry of the future is expected to carry ever increasing loads this assistance could prove vitally important at CA drones will likely be used for mine clearance and submarine detection but may also serve more Sinister purposes already Russia has claimed that it has manufactured an unmanned nuclear torpedo that could allegedly be used to unleash radio active tidal waves on coastal cities though the effectiveness and even the existence of this weapon is disputed despite the inevitable advance of drone technology especially in the air the impact of drones on future conflicts is far from certain while tb2 have knocked out Russian air defenses and thousands of disposable drones swarm the battlefields of Ukraine it would be Hasty to assume that drones will fundamentally alter all future conflicts modern air combat is characterized by a sort of hide and seek between aircraft and air defenses with the aircraft trying to avoid enemy air defenses and air defenses trying to find enemy aircraft drones influential as they are do not radically alter this equation drones may be less vulnerable to certain air defenses at certain times but they're not Invincible as more and more States acquire drones more and more States will also acquire the means to counter them the hide andek seek of modern air combat will continue much as it did before additionally while cheap uavs can provide many benefits of a traditional Air Force they do not offer all of the capabilities that traditional more expensive aircraft can small short-range drones simply cannot compete on the same level as long range strategic aircraft which remain expensive and hard to acquire while drones will certainly lead to an increase in the number of aircraft in the sky and will will provide smaller nations with capabilities they didn't have before don't expect a fleet of Radio Shack uavs to shoot down the entire US Air Force One Way that drones will likely alter the future of War has to do with their implications for airspace sovereignty since many countries View using drones as less aggressive than the deployment of man aircraft formerly contested airspaces may become more aggressively challenged for example South Korea views man flights over the contested areas of the Korean Peninsula to be too risky but has suggested that it would be willing to conduct missions in the area using unmanned aircraft similarly India has already started using drones along the line of contact with Pakistan in cashmir this type of airspace contestation raises the question of whether we could walk the tight rope into a conflict that could have been avoided combat drones have a history that stretches back over 100 years but it is only in the 21st century that we've begun to see full-fledged drone Warfare come into its own despite the seemingly endless ways that drones have been utilized in modern conflicts such as the one in Ukraine drone Warfare will certainly become even more complex and even more deadly over our lifetimes nevertheless drones are not guaranteed to fundamentally alter the course of all future conflicts and significant risks remain in their unrestricted utilization so will drones be present in the future of War almost certainly but will drones be the future of War only time will tell thank you again to War Thunder for sponsoring today's video support our Channel and use our Link in the description to download the game get your exclusive

       " \" although the history of the United States as an independent nation begins with the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 its roots reach back at least 20 more years with the start of the 7 years war the fighting between its two main participants Great Britain and France spread across the globe reaching also their neighboring Colonial possessions in North America by the end of the war France had been beaten leaving the British Empire in control over much of the eastern half of the continent with its biggest competitor defeated Britain now ruled the Seas as well as a third of all European trade by all accounts this was a major win for the burgeoning Empire yet beneath the surface the saes of Victory were weighed down by the anchors of debt amounting to a total of 133 million the debt marked a a significant hit to the British economy and pushed Parliament to take drastic Financial measures the Royal Navy which had helped Britain to victory was to become one of the primary losers in a series of cuts which would see its budget plummet from 7 million in 1762 to 2.8 million in the aftermath of the war and dropping to as little as 1.5 million in 1769 these measures however only accounted for a sliver of the debt and British citizens would be forced to do most of the heavy lifting in the form of a series of new and higher taxes however the Empire would have little time to recuperate just as the Embers of the Seven Years War were dying out a new Wildfire erupted when a confederation of dissatisfied Native American nations in the Great Lakes region took up arms against the American colonists settling in their territory in response the British government issued the Proclamation of 1763 which banned American colonists with the exception of licensed fur Traders from settling west of the alagan fearing a reaction from the disgruntled frontiersmen Britain promptly reinforced its North American Military presence further increasing their

and other useful items like energy refills skill Toms and XP boosters King George III the British monarch now found himself in a critical juncture his Empire needed to find a way out of its increasing debt but with his people already heavily taxed and with the budget of critical institutions like the Royal Navy cut to the extreme the only natural recourse seemed to put a shared burden on his American subjects besides it was only fair that the Colonials pay for their way for the added protection they were receiving from the Army the colonists however had grown increasingly distant from their motherland and the Americans would prove unwilling to meekly bow down before the demands of some Far Away King the first signs of dissent came when Britain introduced the Sugar Act in 1764 which taxed sugar molasses as well as other imported products purchased at a cheaper rate from sources outside of the Empire the ACT also forced captains of merchant ships to post bonds and provide exhaustive cargo invoices while also allowing Royal Navy personnel to search and seiz vessels suspected of smuggling goods soon angry Tradesmen were were knocking on London's doors arguing that the Sugar Act was infringing on their right to free trade set out in a previous Charter with the British government many colonists were unaware that the Sugar Act was just the beginning of Taxation efforts in America the Stamp Act was soon introduced requiring citizens to pay taxes on a range of items by purchasing stamps a similar version of this act was already providing close to half of the budget of the government from the pockets of English citizens and would soon raise a large sum from its American subjects as well however these American subjects proved to be of a different mind as mass outrage erupted in the colonies ultimately leading to the ACT being repealed in 1766 the British Parliament worried about losing face and wanting to avoid being seen as losing authority over its American possessions made sure to exchange the Stamp Act with the decory act which stated that Parliament had full control over lawmaking in the American colonies soon another tax on imported items such as tea and glass was introduced under the town shend act further incensing the colonists and leading Samuel Adams to write a letter on behalf of the Massachusetts legislature calling for a boycott of English products until the taxes were repealed like many others Adams was outraged that the parliament believed it had the right to force Americans to pay for the government's expenses without having American representatives in Parliament soon the slogan no taxation without representation would become the battlecry for colonists protesting British attempts to tax the colonies back in Windsor Castle King George followed the developments from America with a remarkable sense of empathy for his dissatisfied subjects while discussing the Stamp Act he stated that it first deprived the Americans by restraining their trade from the means of acquiring wealth and then taxed them Britain's prime minister however Frederick North or Lord North saw things differently and remained a firm proponent of maintaining parliament's right of authority over the colonies which was seen as a vital component of British Liberty the matter of Taxation was now increasingly becoming a matter of power and hierarchy similarly American was soon to transform into allout Rebellion the city of Boston home of public agitator Samuel Adams was known as the Beating Heart of American unrest latent tensions against British rule would come to a head on March 5th 1770 when 400 bostonians harassed and assaulted Eight British soldiers who In the Heat of the Moment resorted to firing their muskets into the crowd injuring six and killing five news about the Boston Massacre as the colonists coined the incident spread like wildfire and only added to the unrest in the city about 4 years later the situation had escalated to the point that parlament felt forced to enact the coercive acts which included the reinforcement of the Boston Garrison by four additional regiments of regulars contrary to the belief that this added military presence would finally quell the rius ials the sight of the hated red coats in the streets and the fact that the British soldiers were to be quartered and supplied by colonists only further angered the American public by February 2nd 1775 the situation in Massachusetts had reached a boiling point as Lord North officially declared the colony to be in a state of rebellion the commander-in-chief of British forces in America General Thomas Gage was promptly ordered to nip the rebellion in the bud by capturing its leaders Gage first moved against a known Rebel ammunition store in the town of conquer in order to deprive his enemy of gunpowder however on April 19th Gage's advancing men walked into a gathering of colonial militia at Lexington Green tensions exploded when an unknown soldier from either side fired his musket prompting the British to fire in Force at the colonial militia word of the incident reached other militia groups in the area and soon the British found themselves ambushed by armed Colonials ultimately resulting in a total of 20% casualties including several key leaders not wishing to lose more of his men in Surprise attacks Gage ordered a retreat after reorganizing his men Gage was ordered to hold on to Boston which would allow the Royal Navy to land reinforcements as Colonial militias laid Siege to the city it was decided that British troops would make a stand at Dorchester Heights and Charlestown to the North of Boston which included The High Ground at Bunker and breeds Hill however the British were up for a bloody surprise when they discovered that the Americans had already set up a series of formidable defenses on breeds Hill casualties mounted as the Infantry assaulted the position and despite coming out on top when the musket fire finally fell silent British losses had been such that the Army would be put on the defensive for nearly a year even the previously empathetic King George had lost his patience lamenting Britain's relatively soft approach to the American colonies as having been a sign of weakness he now urged the might of the British power to Bear down on his rebellious subjects on August 23rd the proclamation of rebellion was officially released to the public at home American assets were frozen while American ships were banned from entering British ports moreover there was was a significant division within the communities of the British colonies many British loyalists who were sympathetic to the crown found themselves in precarious situations facing hostility and often being ostracized by their American neighbors many of them had to flee their homes relocating to Canada or returning to Britain this internal Division and the plight of the Loyalists was a testament to the multifaceted nature of the conflict in the meantime 20,000 regulars were dispatched to America additionally around 10,000 troops often mistakenly called mercenaries were sent from German states most notably the hessin contrary to Common belief these hessin were not individual soldiers For Hire but were part of organized units leased by German princes to the British crown their presence was not a mere commercial transaction but a complex web of political and diplomatic ties the rebels hearing of these reinforcements sent the Olive Branch Petition to London in hopes of preventing a formal war from being declared the petition restated the colonists appreciation for the union of Britain and the colonies and that they had merely taken up arms in response to the unfair measures taken against them as such the Colonials were allegedly more than ready to restore peace if these issues were to be addressed King George however decided decided to ignore the petition and responded to America's Declaration of Independence by accusing the power Hungary leaders in the colonies of having openly rejected the British government and with the ongoing hostilities being the only right response reactions from the British media were mixed with some newspapers praising the Americans bravery While others wrote mockingly about the Declaration supposed pretentious Pros the fighting around Boston continued during the following months until General George Washington finally managed to capture Dorchester Heights on March 4th 1776 forcing General William how who had succeeded Gage as commander-in-chief to evacuate the city having to come up with a new plan the British command decided to focus its efforts on New York in late June after landing his army at Sandy Hook New Jersey Hal called a March toward New York City where they were met by Washington's men during the fighting which took place in the present day Northwest Brooklyn Heights in heavy rain and fog how nearly managed to encircle the Colonials but rough winds on the East River prevented him from closing the Gap close to 10,000 men managed to escape as dense fog masked their Retreat despite having failed to crush the colonial army the Victorious British now felt confident that their military superiority over Washington's makeshift Army would ultimately and inevitably win them the war how in fact was so encouraged by his victory that he initially attempted to get the Americans to restore Peace by retracting the Declaration of Independence when this proposal predictably went nowhere the general moved to secure New York City and destroy the remaining Colonial troops by the end of the year Britain seemed to be poised to win the war their main stumbling block however would come from their arch nemesis the French as the British army failed to deliver the anticipated knockout blow throughout the winter and into the following year France decided to support the Rebellion back in Britain King George worried that the French were planning to make a move against the West Indies which were a key part of British global trade in response 5,000 troops stationed in Philadelphia were withdrawn to reinforce the islands in 1778 marking the start of a major diversion of resources away from the American Mainland to the Caribbean eventually leading to British commanders begging for more soldiers and even prisoners being sent to make up for the lack of Manpower meanwhile the escalating war was starting to wear down on the patience of British citizens who had to deal with ever higher taxes while neighboring Ireland in the meantime suffered in the face of a major recession due to the halt on American Trade yet despite these setbacks at home British forces continued to gain important victories on the battlefield in Spring of 1780 General Henry Clinton attacked Charleston South Carolina the northern theater had stalemated and it was hoped that a campaign in the southern colonies where British loyalists were more common would finally bring the Americans to their knees amidst the war in America the British were also fiercely defending the rock of jalter in Europe commencing in 1779 this great Siege of Gibralter a grueling conflict against Spain and France lasted for nearly 4 years and was the largest Battle of the entire War despite no actual Americans being present while outnumbered and facing Naval blockades the British showcased their military prowess employing Innovative tactics and Engineering Feats like the construction of the jalter galleries or tunnels their tenacious defense eventually led to victory in 1783 solidifying British control over the Strategic Peninsula back in the colonies British military prowess was also present Charleston fell to the British after a 6 week Siege capturing an entire colonial army of about 5,000 men in Bolden Clinton visualized a sweeping pincer strategy against the Americans he designated the southern operations to General Charles Cornwallis and moved North to Marshal the troops around New York the objective was a coordinated Advance with corn Wallace pushing the Americans through the Carolinas and Virginia and Clinton's Army converging from New York by February of 1781 corn Wallace was marching his men through North Carolina he hoped to force General Nathaniel Green's weaker American Army to face him in battle however time for Cornwallis was running out as supplies were wearing thin and his men began suffering from exhaustion on March 14th Green's men were finally located at Guilford courthouse once again British superiority on the Battlefield showed but their victory was bought at a considerable cost with 25% of cornwallis's men having become casualties during the fighting Green in the meantime had managed to escape the field of battle with the rest of his army having run out of patience Cornwallis made the decision to bypass the Carolinas and move straight toward Virginia after reorganizing his men the British ordered a March toward the Inland part of Yorktown here however the situation would take a turn for the worse in SE September a French Fleet managed to penetrate British defenses and block access to the Chesapeake during the Battle of The Capes cornwallis's men were now cut off from reinforcements and resupply and would be forced to dig in and await Relief by September 28th an American Army reinforced with French troops began to lay Siege to Yorktown up in New York General Clinton heading the northern Pinsir remained relatively calm writing about the situation he stated that Cornwallis is safe enough unless a superior Fleet shows itself in which case I despair of ever seeing peace restored to this miserable country his main concern was with Washington's Army whom he believed were preparing to advance on New York with the help of French ships at Staten Island further rumors about the French ships sailing up from the West Indies did little to soothe his concerns and persuaded him to remain cautious rather than hasten his Force to the aid of Cornwallis Washington however had had no intention of attacking New York and was in fact moving his men Southward toward the trapped British Army the situation in York town in the meantime was deteriorating by the day corn Wallace had already abandoned his outer lines but without supplies his men could only hold on for so long on October 19th the defense fell apart as the 8,000 remaining British soldiers laid down their arms although the disastrous defeat at Yorktown was an enormous blow to the British army King George urged his commanders to carry on the fight as if nothing had changed in reality it was clear that the Empire could not hope to reasonably sustain the costs in Manpower supplies and funds that were required to prolong its efforts and to Vanquish the Rebellion moreover the important American victory at Yorktown had likely only emboldened the colonial Spirits in Parliament the writing seemed to be on the wall America was here to stay and the sheer effort it would require to attempt to put the proverbial Eagle back into its cage was simply deemed not worth the cost a few more skirmishes unfolded before the peace negotiations began the Treaty of Paris finalized in 1783 brought an official end to the American war for independence in this pivotal agreement Britain made numerous significant concessions they recognized the United States as a Sovereign Nation and seeded vast territories east of the Mississippi River to the new Republic the Americans were also granted important fishing rights off the coast of New Finland the treaty defined the boundaries between British North America now Canada and the United States setting the Great Lakes region as the northern border of the US additionally Britain returned Florida to Spain having previously captured it and the Mediterranean island of Minorca which the British had held was seated back to Spain on November 25th the last of the British troops departed from New York while the treaty marked the end of the Revolutionary War the sting of losing the American colonies lingered with King George III and the British establishment it would necessitate several tumultuous decades punctuated by conflicts like the War of 1812 before the two Nations established the Dee rooted Alliance they share today thanks again to

       " \" at the start of 1519 the Aztec Empire was a dominant force in meso America although commonly seen as one people the Aztec empire actually began in 1428 as an alliance between the three city states of toosan texoco and tpan among these ostian would soon rise above the others gaining infamy in the eyes of their tributaries those unfortunate enough to fall under its yoke were forced to supply the Triple Alliance not only with raw materials but also with a steady flow of prisoners for Human Sacrifice although it is not entirely clear how many people were sacrificed in total It is believed that in times of drought thousands of human lives would be ritually killed over a matter of days Aztec warriors also embarked on what was known as flower wars to capture prisoners for sacrifice and some members of the Aztec aristocracy even cannibalized the bodies of some of the victims having said that life in tanos titit landan entailed more than just an endless stream of gruesome offerings and peculiar appetites the mexic as the cities inhabitants were called greatly valued scholarship and ttit land contained several large libraries with manuscripts on a wide range of topics ranging from religion and genealogies to government and geography the Fateful event that would radically alter the course of Mesoamerican history came in February 1519 when a group of several hundred conquistadors landed in the Gulf of Mexico in search of Glorious cities rumored to be filled with gold its leader nnan Cortez was following in the footsteps or rather the sales of two prior Expeditions which had ventured into the Gulf before him but unlike his predecessors Cortez expedition was Rife with controversy from the very start after having budded heads with the Cuban Governor Diego Velasquez Cortez had his expeditionary Charter revoked at the last moment not one to take no for an answer Cortez decided to ignore the order and in an open Act of mutiny set sail for meso

learned to speak Mayan was promptly brought aboard as Cortez personal translator a few weeks later agular would prove his usefulness during peace talks with the panin a Mayan city state that the Conquistadors had encountered a few weeks into their expedition as a peace offer the Mayans provided Cortez with 20 slaves among whom a woman who spoke both Mayan as well as the Aztec language naad together agilar and the slave woman who would become known as La Malin would form a crucial link for Cortez to communicate with the Aztec people armed with the power of language as well as of Steel and gunpowder the Spaniards set sail for their final destination upon arrival the Nifty Cortez declared the establishment of viaa De La verac Cruz marking the first Spanish colony in meso America however in reality verac Cruz was not much more than a name on a map and primarily served as a means for Cortez to take advantage of Spanish law in an attempt to escape the jurisdiction of Governor Velasquez Cortez arrival in the mean time had not gone unnoticed and his party was soon welcomed by representatives of the Aztec Emperor M Zuma despite their seeming lack of hostility Cortez knew that these formalities were unlikely to last and he was all too aware of the pressing need to address his glaring numerical inferiority fortunately for the Spaniards years of often brutal Aztec rule had left few friends among their tributaries and many like the totonac Confederacy were Rel relatively easily persuaded to turn against their hated overlords upon hearing of the news of the Spanish totonac Alliance mck Zuma sensed trouble and sent forth another score of polite ambassadors bearing gifts of gold and cloth in a doomed attempt to appease the Spaniards and perhaps to keep an eye on their movements but most of all to dissuade them from visiting ttit land Cortez however felt encouraged rather than dissuaded by the the lavish Gifts of gold and ordered a daring March toward the city it was all or nothing for the Spanish leader and to ensure the Loyalty of his own men he made sure to Scuttle his ships before setting off violence erupted when Tac Kalin Warriors began harrying the column as it passed through Tac Calen territory 2 weeks later the Bloodshed spread into September as the Spanish Camp was attacked by day while Cortez men raided toax Cala Villages by night after 18 days of brutal Warfare which had come at the cost of half of the Spanish Cavalry and a fifth of Cortez men peace finally returned to the territory Cortez had convinced the harassers that they had a common enemy in the Aztecs the tacons had reason to resent the Empire as it had conquered most of their territory during their yearly flower wars which had been going on for nearly a century seeing a golden opportunity for Retribution the TAC Kalin lowered their arms and joined the march to the city that being said the violence did not stop there before the Spanish went to tenos landan they marched alongside their Tac CA allies on the city of chalula and massacred its civilian population over the course of several days chalula an important religious Center had formerly been part of of the Tila Kalin sphere of influence before switching sides and allying with the Aztecs the exact reasons for the massacre are disputed but it may have been a mixture of the TAC Kalin wanting to get rid of a political rival and the Spanish wanting to send a message to rival cities while it is clear that many city states had a grudge with the Aztecs at chalula the Spanish clearly demonstrated what would happen if cities didn't Ally with them by the first week of November the surviving conquistadors finally laid eyes on tenos land home to over 300,000 inhabitants this massive City dwarfed almost all of its contemporary European counterparts the Vista of its many canals densely populated neighborhoods and imposing temples and palaces struck the approaching Spaniards with awe and prompted some to wonder whether they were in a dream having failed to dissuade him from visiting the city City M Zuma now felt obliged to invite Cortez into his Palace it was here that the Conquistadors discovered a secret room where the emperor kept his treasure the sight of numerous golden objects Jewels plates and ingots dumbfounded the Spaniards having located the rumored Treasure Trove Cortez began to pressure M Zuma by asking him to allow his men to erect a cross and an image of the Virgin Mary next to two large Aztec Idols naturally this provocative request was caused for considerable consternation among the mexicas causing an eruption of violence that cost the lives of seven Spaniards realizing the precarity of their situation Cortez retaliated by putting M Zuma under house arrest in the palace assuming personal control over the city with the emperor essentially taken hostage the Spaniards hoped to dissuade the Aztecs from further resistance mck Zuma on his part continued to stand firm behind his policy of diplomacy and peace after firmly refusing advice from his Chieftains to attack the Conquistadors he finally allowed Cortez men to build a Catholic Altar on the temple it was the first real sign that the once Mighty emperor of the great Aztec empire had been reduced to little more than a puppet of Cortez meanwhile off to the east another significant development was taking place while Cortez executed his Ceta 900 conquistadors under the command of Pono de narvas were landing on the orders of Governor Velasquez their objective to deal with Cortez hearing of the news Cortez assembled his best men and set off to face narvas in battle leaving Pedro de Alvarado and a small Garrison in charge of the city this would turn out to be a fateful decision as the the cruel and easily angered Alvarado had little patience and even less respect for the Aztec people and when on May 22nd 1520 mcde Zuma asked for permission to celebrate an Aztec Festival which included Human Sacrifice Alvarado and his men interrupted the festivities killing nearly all of the mostly unarmed Warriors and noblemen inside of the Great temple check out our library of over 100 exclusive videos on armchair history TV new videos come out every week and we create armchair historian Originals every single month Alvarado's men claimed to have merely acted to prevent Human Sacrifice while survivors retorted that the Spaniards had grown wild at the sight of gold jewelry that those in attendance were wearing hearing of the massacre mck Zuma again urged for cooler heads to Prevail and ordered his people to stand down the Aztecs have however had had enough and Rose up in Revolt due east Cortez had managed to sneak up on NIS at seala and ordered his men to attack at nightfall his mixed group of 250 Spaniards and 200 natives soundly defeated nv's numerically Superior Force which included Horsemen and artillery in an ultimate slap to the face to Governor Velasquez the survivors were then convinced to join Cortez with promises of boundless Aztec riches arriving back at tonos land Cortez found Alvarado's men under siege in the palace acting quickly Cortez ordered M Zuma to address his people in a final doomed attempt to restore peace and allow the Spaniards to peacefully withdraw from the city however this desperate gesture merely stoped the PES of Fury cheers Rose from the crowd as M Zuma faced a rain of stones and darts his people had had enough of their emperor and had in fact already chosen to elect his successor qu laak the tragic mck Zuma would not survive the assault though the Aztecs would later claim that he was killed by the Spaniards after his usefulness to them had expired with their bargaining chip gone and with supplies rapidly dwindling Cortez realized that time was running out he ordered his men to break out at night with his much gold and other treasure as they could carry the party headed west under the cover of a welcome rainstorm winding their way through the sleeping City however before long they were spotted and the alarm was sounded within no time a crowd of Aztecs emerged from their houses to attack the fleeing column while hundreds of men in canoes harassed Cortez men as they fought their way across the cway leading out of the city some soldiers lost their footing and drowned in the lake weighed down by all their equipment and the treasure that they had so desired Cortez himself was well ahead of the group leading a Vanguard of Horsemen leaving the rest of his men behind to fend for themselves upon reaching safety at the Village of takuba the Spanish leader had a change of heart and turned around to come to the aid of those still fighting their way out along the way he found a badly wounded Alvarado with a group of Spaniards and Tac CeX according to Conquistador Diaz del Castillo it was at this point that Cortez broke down in tears during the bloody breakout attempt an estimated 4 to 800 Spaniards had been killed drowned or captured while around 1,000 TX calex had suffered the same fate in terms of equipment all of the artillery and most of the horses had been lost and the exhausted and mostly wounded survivors were left to make do with whatever they had managed to carry along Cortez alleged sorrow at the sight of this tragedy Sol Sol ified it in Spanish and Mexican history as the night of Sorrows despite their apparent weakness ctez men were far from defeated about a week later the Aztec struck again at otumba in an attempt to deliver the killing blow but their victory during the night of Sorrows had made the Aztecs overconfident and the Spaniard skillful use of Cavalry and targeting known leaders ultimately sent their army into disarray having fought off his pursuers Cor withdrew his remaining men to the relative safety of tacala to rest and reorganize though defeated on the field of battle the Aztecs had retaken control over their Capital this Victory however would be shortlived as soon a far more lethal and Insidious enemy would arrive in the form of small poox having no prior contact with this disease the vulnerable Aztecs were at its Mercy thousands perished in short succession among them the new emperor quid laak and by the end of the year 1520 it is estimated that the disease had killed some 8 million people in the area now known as Mexico having licked their wounds from the night of Sorrows and the Battle of otumba Cortez men were reinforced by more native allies from teex ccoo and once again set off for ttit landan in early 1521 well aware of the weakened state of the Aztec empire the Spanish leaders undoubtedly expected a switch Victory however to their surprise the stubborn Defenders of the city refused to yield frustrated the Spaniards ordered tox Cala laborers to construct Cannon mounted Brigantine to take control of the lake portable water to the city was cut off on May 10th yet by the end of June its Defenders still stood firm various attempts to end the siege through diplomacy failed having run out of patience Cortez ordered a massive assault on the city to take the market of tat lco but his men were forced to retreat in the face of heavy resistance Cortez himself was captured during the fighting and was fortunate to escape with his life when his men came to the rescue brutal Urban combat and sustained fanatical resistance persisted until the remaining Defenders made their last stand at Plaza mayor where they finally surrendered on August 13th the reign of quok the last Aztec Emperor ended when he was captured trying to flee the city in a canoe but the catastrophe that had befallen ttit land would not end there the Victorious Spaniards and their native allies mercilessly sacked the city in search of gold and revenge Cortez on his part would be rewarded for the astounding success of his Valiant Expedition by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles I by being named captain general of the vice royalty of New Spain in October of 1522 Cortez lethal gamble had paid off the mutinous soldier had become the new hero of Spain within just two short years Eran Cortez relatively small group of conquistadors had managed to Vanquish an Empire the scale of the Aztec Expedition alongside its capture in Treasure would not be matched until the 1532 conquest of the Incan Empire in modern-day Peru however as we've seen Cortez Conquest was far from a straightforward military Affair besides the spaniard's technological and tactical superiority it was the vital support of large numbers of native allies the overcaution and inaction of M Zuma as well as the brutal effects of the smallpox epidemic that all played a part in the rapid toppling of the Aztec empire its fall marked the start of further Spanish conquests in the region ultimately leading to the Spanish control over the entirety of meso America Conquest in turn was followed by the mass conversion of the indigenous people to Catholicism and

the Russian government now more than ever mercenaries have become sought after for their services across the globe in a myriad of conflicts but where did they come from the idea of a soldier For Hire is nothing new since the ancient period mercenaries were popularly used to supplement and sometimes replace regular armies out on campaign or in the field however in the mid 19th century Nations shifted their focus away from mercenaries and toward developing their own regular forces only in recent decades has there been a new demand for Soldiers of Fortune though concerns about their dubious ethics and profit-driven motives have led to questions about their legality this resulted in the United Nations adopting the International Convention against the recruitment use financing and training of mercenaries treaty in December of 1989 with the primary gain of suppressing access to mercenary services this treaty entered into force on October 2001 and defined a mercenary as any person who is recruited locally or abroad to take on a combat role does so for the sake of private gain is not a resident National or military personnel of the parties to the conflict and has not been sent on official state military duty in order to circumvent these rules many enterprising professionals would go on to form private military companies or pmc's which differ just enough from the mercenary definition to maintain legality where mercenaries engage in combat pmc's claim to act in self-defense where mercenaries get deployed pmc's conduct routine security often working as International firms pmc's provide militaries and political entities services such as combat assistance military training risk assessment Logistics intelligence and security many of these companies are useful to world powers as the discrete connections between a PMC and its client allow for a client's involvement by proxy into conflicts as unofficial belligerent permitting them to exercise geopolitical and Military

today this flexibility and discretion have made pmc's a staple of modern conflicts for example in 2007 over 180,000 private contractors across more than 20 companies were operating in Iraq with around 25% of these engaged in combat operations American pmc's have also been involved in attempts to overthrow entire governments like silver Corp USA who participated in the failed operation aimed at deposing Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in the 1990s the South African people MC executive outcomes had over 3,000 troops and 500 Military Officers operating across 10 countries in Africa many from the SAS and South African Special Forces while South Africa shut down executive outcomes through anti- mercenary legislation in 1998 the company was reestablished in 2020 and still operates today one of the earliest examples of the modern PMC can be traced back to the km M LTD better known as the Keen meeni Services founded in 1975 by four British War veterans and staffed by exas Personnel Keen meeni started out protecting British diplomats in Buenos Ares then in 1976 expanded to training the Sultan of oman's Special Forces a unit set up and commanded by Keeny meeni contractors directly information on KMS is shadowy numerous investigations turned up dead ends as Prospect Ive interviewees refused to discuss KMS the British foreign office claimed to know very little about KMS however this was far from the case KMS was heavily involved in the Sri Lankan Civil War which occurred between 1983 and 2009 it was a conflict fought primarily between the sinh heles Sri Lankan government and tamell separatists namely The Liberation Tigers of Tamal ilam who were frustrated by discrimination and wished to carve out their own ethnic State amid this fighting the SRI Lankin police decided they wanted to be able to engage the rebels directly in Special Forces operations kinim mini arrived in Sri Lanka in 1984 and was tasked with training and equipping a force of 600 men soon to be known as the Sri Lankan police special task force or stf KMS promised 120 new stf Personnel members every 12 weeks to engage the Rebels on September 1st 198 4 the stf Convoy near Point Pedro was hit by a rebel landmine four stf members were killed and the stf responded by burning buildings shops a college and the point Pedro Library killing several civilians the regular Sri Lankan Army was known to retaliate against civilians after ambushes but with the stf things were different as a fresh unit trained only by KMS and its professional soldiers there was shock as to why the stf would act in this way rather than pull KMS back the British reasoned that if their people didn't train the Sri Lankans they might be desperate enough to seek out mercenaries from America France or Belgium who they believed would only worsen the situation at the end of 1984 the British approved Keen Mei to train the Sri Lankan Army as well Britain had few economic interests in Sri Lanka but it did have billions of pounds in India India supported the Tamil side of the conflict and KMS report of the Sri Lankan government looked bad on Britain whose concerns over other nations getting involved in Keeny mei's Place convinced them to let the mercenaries continue utilizing the KMS mercenaries allowed the foreign office to get involved without officially doing so avoiding some degree of backlash meanwhile KMS contractors continued serving with the stf well into the war with some even operating as Pilots for gunships that that terrorized to Mill Villages all the while Britain stood by worrying that their intervention would provoke backlash from both India and the International Community while KMS closed down in the 1990s a new contractor would find its Beginnings in America Blackwater founded in 1995 by former US Navy SEAL Eric Prince Blackwater at first offered typical PMC services such as domestic security and military training by by 1998 Blackwater received its first contracts for expanded military training spending its early years working with small military units and law enforcement things changed after the attacks on September 11th when the US government became extremely concerned with security and terrorist activity Blackwater was shortly contracted and asked to provide emergency assistance during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan during the war in Iraq the American Diplomat Paul Brammer was sent to Baghdad to serve as director of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance as well as heading the Coalition provisional Authority which looked to transition the Iraqi government away from the previous baist party under Saddam Hussein as the deao leader of Iraq and representative of the American occupiers Bremer wasn't the most popular among native Iraqis meaning his presence was immediately met with threats and condemnation in response Blackwater was sent to protect Bremer with this contract Blackwater gained a foothold in the war on terror and with the American government during this period on December 6th 2003 Blackwater first proved its value to the US government Bremer and his Aid Brian McCormack were traveling in an armored SUV as part of a convoy protected by two Bell helicopters each containing two Blackwater snipers suddenly the Convoy's lead vehicle hit an IED resulting in an explosion quickly followed by AK-47 f from resistance Fighters blackwater's protection of Bremer in this assassination attempt in which all escaped uninjured made it clear to America and the world what the PMC was capable of blackwater's Effectiveness was countered by its callous behavior and general trigger happy aggressiveness with the PMC instigating around 163 out of 195 shooting incidents since 2005 eventually blackwater's recklessness would be their undoing in the esur Square incident in Iraq on September 16th 2007 four Blackwater members opened fire in a crowded Bagdad intersection resulting in the death of 17 unarmed civilians and severe injury of 14 others the incident caused outrage among the Iraqi populace and in response us officials quickly removed Blackwater Agents from the country get access to over a 100 exclusive history videos on our website armchair history TV use code mercenary 50 for half off your first month three of the Blackwater members were found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and the fourth of first-degree murder throughout the hearings Eric Prince defended Blackwater and the members involved in the incident eventually Prince would leave the company and Blackwater would change its name to XE Services then to academi before finally merging with its rival group triple canopy to form canellis Holdings under constellis many pmc's still operate across the Middle East as for Prince he would go on to serve as the head of Frontier Services Group a PMC heavily invested in by China and positioned throughout Africa while these groups would host the attention of many analysts throughout the 2010s it's safe to say that the Limelight has shifted back towards Russia thanks to the recent conflicts in Syria and Ukraine both of which Enlisted the the influential and now Infamous Vagner group established in 2014 by Demitri utkin a veteran of the chin Wars Vagner was owned and funded by yeni progan a Russian oligarch nicknamed Putin's Chef due to his catering services provided to the Kremlin vogner's Personnel typically consist of Russian ex-military operatives though more controversial elements include units ranging from foreign volunteers such as the Scandinavian nidhog unit and the Serb unit to specialized volunteers with connections to farri circles like the rusich unit as one of Russia's biggest PMC groups Vagner has been instrumental in Russia's quest to gain geopolitical footholds and influence around the world all without the need of sending actual troops into International conflicts Vagner has gained Russia's sizable influence in Africa including access to Diamonds oil and warm water ports through Vagner Russia has been able to establish an overseas presence with little risk only making use of the Russian military to step in once situations have stabilized Vagner was first deployed in Ukraine in 2014 where it assisted Russia in its annexation of Crimea they then provided support to separatist forces in the luhansk People's Republic with their work including assassinations and participation in the Battle of dealva in 2015 at a state dinner in December 2016 notably attended by utkin other members of Vagner and Russian President Vladimir Putin utkin was given a state medal for courage on the battlefield which caused some wonder if Vagner was allowing Russia to get involved in combat situations without officially sending their military during the Syrian Civil War the Syrian Army's Manpower fell from 250,000 at the beginning of the conflict in 2011 to only 125,000 by 2015 in need of soldiers to fight Isis and other Syrian rebels Syria requested help Russia extended its hand providing logistical support along with the deployment of troops in 2015 followed shortly by the Vagner group The PMC was first tasked with protecting military bases and other infrastructure but before long had been shifted to a combat role in late 2016 the Syrian government reached an agreement with pran's company evop which made it responsible for retaking Syrian oil fields within Isis territory protecting and transporting their products and in return receiving a quarter of the profits conveniently Vagner group was used as the muscle to complete this goal by February 2018 Syrian soldiers special ops forces and Vagner contractors converged on an outpost around Dar Azor located nearby an oil refinery The Outpost housed American special ops and Syrian Democratic forces es engaged in operations against Isis confused by the larger number of groups engaged in the region US military command contacted Russia to determine whether they had soldiers present Around The Outpost the answer was no and the US called ground and air strikes resulting in up to 200 casualties including dozens of Vagner Personnel when asked about the incident Russia denied involvement and even when it became clear that they were there they still refused used to acknowledge vogner's participation in the attack with Russia's oil and gas economy hampered by us sanctions Vagner began moving their focus toward Africa entering into multi-million dollar agreements with African States in need of energy and electricity Vagner deployed to several of these nations with one notable example being the Central African Republic which had recently been embroiled in a civil war the un's peacekeeping force in the region was left ineffective by its low numbers and by 2017 Russia offered to help the Central African Republic and that help came in the form of Vagner in return for this assistance Russian mining companies were given access to these Central African gold and diamond deposits both heavily guarded by Vagner Personnel Russia's connection to the Central African Republic has given them political influence in the country with Vagner investing in radio stations that broadcast pro-russian propaganda and build boards promoting Russia's good intentions similar situations unfolded in Libya and Sudan where vogner's support of the highest bidder has gained Russia access to substantial oil reserves in Libya and Sudanese borders for use in smuggling out their newly mined diamonds from central Africa skirting us sanctions expectedly Russia has also deployed Vagner soldiers in Ukraine exact numbers on Vagner casualties thus far are unclear though president volodimir zalinsky claimed Ukrainian forces have killed 21,000 Vagner Personnel in just eastern Ukraine alone throughout this conflict prian wasn't shy about letting the Russian government know when he was unhappy with them he had complained about a lack of ammunition High casualties and poor strategy in Ukraine even foreshadowing the possibility of Revolution in Russia if the government didn't put more effort into the war on June 23rd 2023 pran accused Russia of falsely just defying the war in Ukraine and expressed deep frustration with the military leaders running the operation he also accused Russia of staging an attack on Vagner an allegation which was denied regardless prashan ordered an armored Convoy of Vagner troops to drive on Moscow stating that he and those with him were going to find out why there is such chaos in the country President Putin's response was to call the action treasonous to which pran objected arguing that he was not betraying Russia or challenging Putin's leaders ERS ship according to pan himself the Convoy came within 200 km of Moscow without any Vagner blood spilled though by the end of June 24th prosan suddenly ordered his soldiers to end the March and return to base the official reason for calling off this move came from the Bellar Russian President Alexander lucenko who brokered a settlement with prosan who in turn agreed to end the Rebellion by August 23rd prosan was killed in a plane crash while over Russia while the use of mercenaries can be seen as lucrative and discreet it is clear that these contracts are not without their problems no matter the country of origin the enterprising nature of private military companies means that they will value the bottom line of their own company and employees over the concerns of any client or setting that they're working in a factor made worse by the nature of their dangerous work as soldiers for H though volatile and self serving mercenaries remain popular instruments of Modern Warfare no doubt we will see them in conflicts to come thank you

later Republic instead the Roman King om was a place marked by poverty filth and violence in the early days it is likely that the Roman way of Waging War was not significantly different from that of other italic peoples local Wars and raids often had several Clans acting cooperatively Within These War bands were the clan Warriors the concept of a uniform was non-existent the quality and quantity of weapons and equipment was would vary widely Clan warriors were without armor and their typical War gear consisted of a shield and two Spears one to be thrown as a missile weapon while the other was retained for stabbing during this period a clan Warrior who gained enough power and Prestige would inevitably find himself in the position of Chieftain the chieftain acted as the leader and kept the Restless Clans together his other equ important function was to carefully divide the loot a chieftain's Prestige was judged by the plunder he could afford to his clan this also extended to his own equipment Chieftains were often resplendant in shining bronze helmets pectorals and Greaves their swords also bronze were designed mainly for cutting but also could be used to thrust or jab it was

cpos a bull-shaped shield in this new style of Spear and shield Warfare the weapon of wealthy citizens was the long thrusting spear first class citizen soldiers also carried a sword but in contrast to Prior Clan Leaders The Sword was now very much a secondary weapon men of the second class were equipped similarly to those of the first but were not expected to provide a full breastplate they also did not use the cpeo shield and were instead equipped with the oblong scutum Shield which was cheaper and offered better protection to the Torso and legs Furthermore with the scutum a soldier could be both defensive and offensive parrying but also punching with its metallic boss plate the less well-off citizens would have had nothing so elaborate as the bronze or linen breast plates that wealthier citizens wore but those who could supplied themselves with with a small bronze breastplate to compensate for their lack of armor these soldiers used the oval scutum instead of the round cpos the fourth and fifth classes marked the lowest rung of the cian system soldiers fighting in these classes were armed as skirmishers and little else fourth class soldiers were expected to be equipped with an oblong Shield spear Javelin and sword while fifth class soldiers were most often left with nothing but slings and stones with the occasional soldiers scraping up enough funds to equip himself with a javelin the end of the monarchy ushered in the Roman Republic under this Republic the old servian system would be developed further into a society whose citizens were obligated to defend their property by contributing to the military in terms of equipment the Roman soldier in this period was still heavily influenced by Greek standards with bronze helmets breastplates and Greaves their arms were most commonly Spears swords and daggers the 4th Century gave the Romans a lesson in humiliation their defeat by the GS at aliia in 390 BC led to the city's sacking and possible destruction if not for the legendary Marcos Fus chameleos later defeats to the samnites forced Rome to rethink their strategy after the disaster of Cina Forks in 321 BC the Roman army instituted the chameleon reforms dropping their rigid fanks in favor of a maniple system splitting the legion into several blocks spaced out for maneuverability the new legionary like his hoplight counterpart excelled At Close Quarters combat but the legion had greater freedom of movement and flexibility in the new Legion the first line contained maniples of haadi these were soldiers of few means who were unarmored except for a bronze helmet and a pictoral plate They Carried a scotum and two throwing P spear one heavy and one lightweight plus a short thrusting sword the second line was made up of maniples of pry pays these were men in the prime of their lives they were fairly wealthy and were able to afford decent equipment they were armed with two heavy Pila and a sword which was used after the spear had been thrown they usually carried a scutum either in the oval or rectangular style and wore bronze helmets often with feathers fixed onto the top to increase stature pipes wore heavy armor most commonly chain mail which offered good protection without hindering movement the third line was made up of the oldest and most mature men consisting of maniples of triari many triari were battle hardened veterans they sometimes wore a distinct at trusco Corinthian helmet which was usually adorned with upright feathers and a horse hair Crest they equipped themselves with a long iron male shirt and an italic strap on bronze geve on their left leg though many Tre would equip themselves with a hair they also carried a scotum and a long thrusting spear or hasta with a large socketed iron spearhead and a bronze butt Spike key to their kit were the gladios a short thrusting sword and a knife the pujo despite the early successes of the manipular system the middle Republic saw Rome's Legions brutalized in the Punic Wars tactical weakness and eventual Manpower shortages highlighted the need for a new pool of recruits to draw from short of the desperation in conscripting slaves the next best thing was the lower class of Rome's citizenry the proletar these younger and poorer citizens made up the bulk of skirmisher infantry the Vitas these skirmishing troops had been around since Rome's earliest days but became a staple of Roman armies by the early middle and late Republican periods characterized by their helmets wolf skin cover which was used to be distinguished from at a distance Vitas were armed with the gladios and a bundle of javelins in 107 BC a general and Statesman by the name of gaos Marios implemented a new system of reforms aimed at revitalizing the Roman army which had struggled to keep up with the new demands of an expanding Empire the Marian reforms established a professional standing army repl placing the property based system with standard pay and entitlement for full citizenship and land ownership upon completed service the Army's structure shifted from maniples to cohorts enhancing flexibility and cohesion more importantly it standardized equipment and dress leading to the conception of the soldier we know today as the typical Roman legionary the legionary was equipped with many carryovers from the Prem Marian troops such as the Pila scutum pujo and gladios in addition to this they wore armor pieces like the Monty fortino helmet and chain mail armor these were not the only pieces available to a legionary but would have been the most common an important addition to the legionaries kit was the kig or hob nail boots these were heavy sold open toed military sandals built for durability protecting the feet while while also allowing flexibility and ease of movement following the Civil Wars of the late Republic gaos Octavius emerged as kaisar Augustus the first emperor of Rome Augustus cut down the bloated and opportunistic Legions of the Civil War period remodeling the Army into a permanent force of 28 Legions and instigating the greatest period of Roman expansion he was the first leader to lay clear terms of service rates of pay and pensions the legions were no longer a citizen militia no one but Augustus had the right to raise new Legions which now owed their loyalty to him alone in this period of military reform equipment was once again further centralized an important development in the early prip Pate era was the clear distinction in military identity through military belts the balos and kig which identified a man as a Soldier many cohorts were still equipped with the chain mail common to the Troops of the late Republic however the Monte fortino type and kulus type helmets were beginning to be phased out as legionaries were equipped with more elaborate GIC and italic style designs these helmets featured ear guards and hinged cheek guards covering the largest possible part of the face without restricting the solders breathing sight and shouting R the first century saw the legionary equipped in what is now their most well-known look this included the adoption of segmented plate armor made of circular bands of metal fastened to internal leather straps known today as lorica segmentata this armor was virtually impenetrable to ancient weapons in addition the legionary scutum had evolved from The Oblong ovals of the Republican era into a smaller more lighter rectangular shield underneath the armor soldiers wore a short sleeved knee length tunic in cold weather long sleeved tunics trousers socks and laced boots were commonly worn by the time of Emperor hadrien Roman territory spanned almost all of Europe the Mediterranean Anatolia and the lant having reached its farthest extent the Empire began to shift towards a defensive posture using its Legions as garrisons given the distance between provinces it was natural that local cultures would influence the dress and uniform of legionaries in their region soldiers serving on the British Frontier would look different from those in Italy Greece or the Eastern provinces after the collapse of the seiran Dynasty in 235 ad the empire was plunged into 50 years of chaos and Civil Wars it was also during this period that the dress and Equipment again changed as the streamlined process of the early prip Pate had buckled under the constant need for new troops by the 3rd Century the traditional italic and g style helmet was gone in its place legionaries wore a heavier helmet of single Bowl construction these offered excellent protection for the head and neck but the cheek pieces obscured peripheral vision and did not include ear holes the solders male now had sleeves extending down to the elbows notably the legionaries would wear full trousers socks and shoes known as caratini legionaries used a weighted pilum a pujo and a scutum while the gladios was replaced by a spata which was still used for thrusting but could also be used for slashing later legionaries carried a slightly dished oval Shield that began replacing the scutum during the 3rd Century they were of plank construction and had reinforcing bars and stitched on Raw Hide edging soldiers carried a pum and their massive swords despite their length were still a cut and thrust weapon despite the change of Sword these legionaries still carried a pujo their short male shirt was worn over a padded arming garment the iron helmet a far simpler piece was composed of many small sections riveted to together such helmets became the norm as they were cheaper and easier to produce since the 2 Century ad an important class of people had established themselves within Roman society The Barbarians these were people who existed outside the Roman perception of Civility and culture they were tribal people originating from the regions of Europe and outside of the Empire since the early pranky Pate many barbarians had served the Empire at as auxiliaries but following the crisis of the 3rd Century they began to settle in the Empire more permanently transforming their role in the Roman military to relieve recruitment issues many barbarians began to be conscripted directly into the army and served under Roman officers yian soldiers formed the core of the Roman armies in the chaotic 3rd Century they wore Bron scale armor and were armed with a Luna a fairly light spear that could be thrown just before contact or retained for hand-to-hand fighting their Shield was a large dished oval constructed of wood planks covered and bound with leather it also had a hollow iron boss which covered the center hand grip under Emperor deian the crisis of the 3rd Century finally ended to stabilize the Empire deian instituted a wide array of reforms among these was the reintroduction of systematic annual conscription of r Roman citizens not seen since the Roman Republic and a restructuring of the military that split the Army into two divisions Frontier guards or limitan and mobile forces or comensis soldiers would be equipped specifically for the duties required of their division though the practice of uniform standardization would be superseded by the issuing of a clothing allowance meaning soldiers had to organize their own dress accordingly responsible for man the defensive outposts and garrisons of the Empire's Borderlands the limitan varied from young conscripts to old veterans they were lightly equipped compared to their mobile counterparts wearing a be Kosovo style helmet with little else in the form of armor They Carried an oval Shield a spear a small hunting knife and a peum comitatenses were generally better armed and drilled than the limitan serving as rapid responders to any external threats to the Empire they wore a ridge helmet with cheek guards but without nose or neck guards the helmet also bore a red plume made of stiffened horse hair they wore male with elbow length sleeves and a hem reaching down to protect the thighs underneath they wore a long sleeved tunic and leather shoes They Carried a sword and their primary weapon the Luna a spear which was light enough to be thrown just before contact palatini were the elites of the late Roman army while they acted similarly to the commit a tenses these Elite troops outranked both them and the limitan the palatini expertise made them sought after by Roman military commanders they wore a plumed version of The Ridge helmet these plumes were usually stiffened horsehair and they matched Shield colors to help unit identification like the comitatenses They Carried both a spear and sword although Rome would fall in the 4th Century the evolution of Roman units would continue for almost a th000 years under the byzantines\",\n",

by an Asian one and it was a huge blow to Russian Prestige this and the substantial amount of casualties that the Russians suffered contributed to Growing domestic unrest which culminated in the 1905 Russian Revolution while the Revolution was unsuccessful ful in stopping Zar Nicholas it severely damaged the reputation of the Russian autocracy as a result when the austr Hungarian Arch Duke France Ferdinand was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb in June of 1914 the Russians were quick to act though Austria Hungary couldn't find evidence that the Serbian state had sponsored the assassination it issued an ultimatum the Russians who had declared themselves Protectors of Christian in the Balkans for centuries now were afraid of austr Hungarian domination in the region this alongside pans Slavic sentiment convinced the Russians to back Serbia even if they had no formal treaty obligation France who had an alliance with Russia also reassured their support if War sparked tensions boiled over and

Manpower its resources were not fully exploited the reforms they had enacted after the Russo Japanese war had not been enough to completely revamp their military industrial complex which was still weak most notably in the state of their railroads Russia's vast territory presented logistical challenges making it difficult to maintain a continuous supply of men and resources to the front lines poor Transportation infrastructure hindered effective mobilization and troop movements the Russian army was IL prepared for Modern Warfare relying on outdated strategies and Equipment the rigid hierarchical structure and lack of proper training and Leadership further hampered the military's performance nonetheless Russia launched offensives into East Prussia and Austria Hungary initially the Russians were successful with the first and second armies advancing into East Prussia and even achieving victory at the Battle of gumin on August 20th although the Russians wanted to threaten coxburg the Russian second Army would be annihilated at the Battle of taner with the Germans capturing over 100,000 prisoners in the conflict's aftermath the Russian army would be defeated once again at the Battle of missan lakes being kicked out of East Prussia for good after their successes in East Prussia the Germans aimed to take Warsaw and fought the Russians at the Battle of the Vistula River but were repelled building on this defensive success the Russians attacked Silesia aiming to take the city of breau but were repulsed and retreated to Wood which would fall by the end of November the first 4 months of the war had taken its toll not only on the morale of the Russians but also on material as they were already low on guns and ammunition against the austr hungarians Russia started with defeats first with the Battle of kashik and later kamarov however at Gila Lipa they drove away the Ostro hun hungarians and captured Lamberg the Russian push into Gala was quite successful taking much land and capturing tens of thousands of austr Hungarian prisoners many of them were austr Hungarian Slavs Czechs slovaks croats and bosnians and Russia portrayed itself as a liberator of subjugated people soon after the Russians laid Siege to The Fortress of pishu which they captured along with more than 100,000 prisoners in March of 1915 Russia's third adversary the Ottoman Empire would join the war in October of 1914 after bombarding Russian Black Sea ports the initial Russian casis belli had been defending their fellow slaves but as the dead mounted this wasn't an especially sellable cause to the Russian public the involvement of the Ottoman Empire which historically had been akin to an arch rival to the Russians made the war more logical to public perception furthermore Russian officials managed to extract a commitment from Britain and France that Russia would take Constantinople at the end of the war formerly the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire which Russia claimed to be the successor of the city would also give Russia access to the Mediterranean the fighting between the Ottomans and Russians would mostly take place in the Caucasus a region rif with ethnic and religious tension both sides would exploit these tensions with the Russians vaguely promising Independence for the Armenians in exchange for assistance against the Ottoman Empire the ottoman Sultan would also use his religious position to leverage support for the war proclaiming a Jihad against the anant in December the Ottomans crossed into Russian Georgia and captured ardahan murdering many Christians in response when the Russians retook it in early 1950 they retaliated killing many in the Muslim Community later the Russians alongside their Armenian allies would achieve a massive victory at sari kames in January of 1915 in response the ottoman violence against the Armenians began to spiral out of control eventually leading to The Armenian genocide in April of 1915 the Germans and austr hungarians launched the gorita tarnoff offensive achiev aing a major breakthrough reversing the Russian gains in Gala and capturing over 140,000 Men by June both pishu and lenberg were in the hands of the Central Powers again the Germans would continue to build on their success seizing Warsaw rest lovk and vus the Russians had suffered heavily as a result of these offensives in July assistant minister of War General Mikel bov pleaded with the French Ambassador for help and revealed that in some infantry regiments one man in three had no rifle the poor fellows wait patiently under the hail of shrapnel for their comrades to fall so they can collect their weapons faced with insurmountable pressure the Russians began the great retreat in which they relinquished over 100,000 square km to the Central Powers while the withdrawal did shorten their front lines and allow for a much needed respit it was a huge blow to morale disillusioned with the constant military struggles Zar Nicholas decided to make himself the supreme commander of the Russian forces tying his regime to success in the war while a large part of Russia's involvement in the war had been due to its role as the preeminent Slavic power the Russian Empire was incredibly diverse large minorities of poles ukrainians Germans Baltic and Central Asian people lived within the Russian borders while the Russians retreated the Germans continued to advance capturing the fortresses at kovno and Novo geores that being said the Germans would be routed at The Fortress of oves in an action that would later be immortalized as the attack of the dead men after their initial bombardment and assault was repelled by the Russians the Germans would surround the Fortress for months on August 6th the Germans decided to use poison gas to root the maskless Russians out the gas proved deadly leading to extremely heavy casualties on the Russian side as the Germans Advanced to take the Russian positions in what they expected to be an unimpeded assault the surviving Russians bloody with chemical burns wrapped up in rags and spitting out blood counterattacked in a bayonet charge shocked by the sight of what appeared to be dead men charging against them the Germans retreated the newspaper would later call this Counterattack the attack of the dead men nonetheless this heroic action would be in vain as the Russians would later abandon the Fortress to the Germans as the war continued its impact on Russia's society and economy was profound and destabilizing the cost of financing the war effort strained the economy leading to inflation scarcity of goods and food shortages the hardships faced by the Russian people during the war fueled discontent and social unrest strikes protest test and bread riots became more prevalent as the war dragged on further weakening the government's ability to maintain control the harsh living conditions and lack of faith in the ruling class created an environment ripe for revolutionary sentiments among the most notorious figures in the Russian court at the time was gregori Rasputin a Mystic holy man who had befriended the royal family and acted as a faith healer for Zar Nicholas's only son Al who suffered from hemophilia many in the court saw him as little more than a religious charlatan that discredited the Zar as Russian military defeats mounted on both the royal family and Ras Putin continued to become increasingly unpopular and eventually Rasputin was assassinated by a group of conservative Russian noblemen who opposed his influence over the Imperial family nonetheless Rasputin's association with the royal family left its mark discrediting the government in the eyes of many in March 1916 the Russians initiated the disastrous Lake narch offensive in the vus area during which the Germans suffered only 1th as many casualties as the Russians many of the Russian casualties would come at the hand of the cold with thousands of soldiers succumbing to hypothermia due to Dreadful Supply conditions the offensive had taken place at the west of France who had hoped it would force the Germans to transfer more units to the East and relieve some pressure from the Battle of Verdan the Germans and austr hungarians fell into complacency after repelling the Russian attacks with the austr Hungarian leadership transferring units from both the Balkan and Russian front to the Italian one many of the experienced divisions on the Eastern Front were withdrawn and sent to the Alps and replaced by formations largely composed of new inexperienced recruits this reshuffling presented an opportunity to the Russians at a war council held with senior commanders and thear in April of 1916 General Alexi bruil presented a plan to the Russian high command proposing a massive offensive against the austr Hungarian forces in Galicia bruff's plan aimed to take some of the pressure off the French and British armies in France and the Italian Army along the isanzo his plan had a mixed reception with some commanders favoring a more defensive strategy but the Zar would nonetheless approve the plan although he did deny brail's request for supporting offensives on June 4th 1916 the Russians opened the offensive with heavy artillery fire brusilov's troops made quick work of the austr hungarians within 4 days of the offensive the austr Hungarian fourth Army had its strength fall from 11 17,800 men to just 35,000 a fall of nearly 70% braila used smaller specialized units to attack weak points in the austr Hungarian trench lines and blow open holes for the rest of the army to advance into these tactics were a remarkable departure from the human wave tactics that had dominated the strategy of all major armies until that point in the first world war soon the Germans began sending reinforcements to prevent the austr hungarians from collapsing and the Russian Advance was slowed but not stopped while the Russians still outnumbered their Germanic opponents their Advance became more and more costly until they were ultimately stopped in the outskirts of the Galician town of Koval attacks continued until the Autumn rains turned the roads to Mud but other than adding to the already terrible casualty list nothing substantial was achieved the damage the brila offensive inflicted meant that the austr Hungarian Army increasing ly had to rely on the support of the Germans it also achieved its original goal disrupting Germany's attack on Verdun and having them transfer forces to the east the early success of the offensive also convinced Romania to join the war on the side of the anant but they would soon be defeated and occupied by the Central Powers the units commanded by brila directly performed very well but the overall campaign was tremendously costly for the Imperial Army with more than half a million men becoming casualties continuing the war was an especially costly Affair for the Russian Empire as a result Zar Nicholas declared a draft of Central Asian men which was unprecedented the Muslim Central Asians had not heeded the ottoman call for Jihad but the draft alongside the rampant Corruption of the Russian regime was too much to bear soon the Kix and kgis were up in arms and thousands of Russian troops were dispatched to put them down the suppression of the Revolt was brutal and led to over 100,000 deaths due to violence disease and the famine that followed hundreds of thousands of central Asians fled into China and the Russian Empire never managed to fully restore order to the region the mounting discontent and frustration with the government's handling of the war culminated in a revolution in February 1917 the February Revolution led to the abdication of Zar Nicholas II and the establishment of a provincial government led by liberal politicians who aimed to continue the war effort and Implement Democratic reforms however the provisional government shared power with the petrograd Soviet a body representing workers and soldiers this Arrangement led to a state of dual power and political instability as the two bodies had conflicting interests and goals while the provisional government's decision to continue the war was unpopular it was the catastrophic kinsky offensive in July 197 that destroyed any morale left in the Russian army along with the image of the provisional government the Army by now was plagued with desertion and Disobedience with many soldiers alluding ignoring officers orders or even outright attacking them amid the chaos and disillusionment the Bolshevik party led by Vladimir Lenin capitalized I ized on popular discontent and actively promoted slogans of Peace land and bread the Bolsheviks aimed to end Russia's involvement in the war redistribute land to The Peasants and provide food to the starving population the October revolution of 1917 spearheaded by the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government and established a communist one keeping to their word the Bolsheviks would end Russia's participation in the war negotiating with Germany and signing the Treaty of breast Lov ending the fighting on December 16th 1917 the price for peace was a heavy one not only did Russia have to concede vast swaths of land to the Central Powers but they also lost millions of men in combat and decimated their economy unfortunately peace with these Central Powers did not mean an end to Russian suffering as soon after the country would devolve into Civil War Russia's participation in the first world war had profound consequences that transformed the country's political and social landscape the war exposed Russia's weaknesses exacerbated internal divisions and led to the downfall of the Imperial regime ultimately Paving the way for the rise of Communism the Russian experience during the war serves as a stark reminder of the human cost and complexity of global conflicts leaving an enduring impact on the nation's history the tragic transformation of Russia during the first world war and the subsequent Russian Revolution left an indelible mark on the 20th century and significantly shaped the course of the world's political and social developments\",\n",
       " \" it is May 4th 1980. President Joseph Bros Tito has died a man whose iron rule was feared and respected throughout the Balkans Tito's death leaves Yugoslavia to descend into a bout of stagnation and rampant nationalism the die was cast as the unity of the federal republic fractured yugoslavia's various peoples could only wonder who would make the first move across the Yugoslav constituent republics nationalists Drew from ethnic and religious tensions whose histories ran deep in the region historically the nation of Yugoslavia was seen as a union of differing ethnic groups formed in the aftermath of the first world war as the kingdom of Serbia merged with the remnant provinces of the austro-hungarian Empire and with it the diverse populations that lived there of these groups the most influential were the serbs who had a larger population demographic and whose territory also hosted the Yugoslav government throughout all of its iterations even under Tito a self-identified croat the Serbian city of Belgrade remained the Yugoslav capital from Belgrade the federal government aimed to keep the country together over the tenuous years following Tito's death but tensions eventually reached a boiling point as many non-serbs felt that they no longer had a place within the Yugoslav State and fighting broke out in Croatia in August 1990 anticipating escalation the Yugoslav military disarmed the territorial units of Slovenia and Croatia the Serb minority living in Croatia opposed the croat push for Independence fearing that their sovereignty would be curbed in the new Croatian State the Croatian serves rose up in arms to resist the Croatian government escalation to this conflict occurred in May 1991 as croatians served paramilitaries clashed with Croatian police in the village of borovocello on June 25th both Slovenia and Croatia would carry out their intentions to secede from the crumbling Yugoslav State and declared independence in response the Yugoslav Army was dispatched

defense blockaded barracks and Rhodes leading to a series of standoffs and limited skirmishes that would be known as the 10-day War after several dozen casualties the conflict ended through negotiation on the 7th of July 1991 when Slovenia and Croatia agreed to a three-month moratorium on secession the federal army withdrew on October 26th granting Slovenia full Independence Macedonia also declared independence and would be the only Yugoslav Republic to secede peacefully Croatia would not be as lucky over the summer of 1991 much of the conflict between Croatian Serb militias and the Croatian government had escalated into all-out war for Croatia the disarmament of their territorial units was aggravated by an arms embargo over Yugoslavia imposed by the United Nations this severe weapons shortage crippled vicroat response to insurrections by Serb minorities and new fronts began to form around these Breakaway Croatian Serb States on the other hand these Serb minority states were not hindered by the federal government this was thanks to assistance from the Yugoslav Army which was becoming increasingly pro-serve as other minorities drifted away from federal service this was helped in part thanks to figures like Serbian president Slobodan milosevic Slobodan milosevic whose nationalist sympathies were protected by the remaining Yugoslav Authority leaving Serbia and Montenegro as the core constituents of the federal republic it was here that milosevic and other Serb nationalists working within Yugoslavia pushed to further their own ethnic influence with a 1994 report by the U.N even claiming that the serbs did not aim to restore Yugoslavia but instead hoped to create a greater Serbia from parts of Croatia and Bosnia following the war while the Croatian government struggled with the Rogue Serb provinces they also clashed with Federal forces August of 1991 saw the Battle of bukovar where intense fighting took place between croat and Yugoslav army forces as the croat attempted to block Federal advances into slavonia meanwhile the city of Dubrovnik would come under siege in October becoming a highlight for the international press who focused on the damage to dubrovnik's architectural Heritage over the destruction of vucavar left devastated by the end of October as a result of land shelling and Air bombardment other cities like karlovats and osiak would also sustain extensive damage during Yugoslav offensives control over Central Croatia was seized by Croatian Serb Rebels who were assisted by Yugoslav forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina led by ratko maladich these gains led to the advanced plan in January 1992 which placed the new Croatian Serb territories under U.N control and brought an end to major military operations until 1995. by March of 1992 the fervor of secession had spread to Bosnia and Herzegovina who declared independence following their own referendum like Croatia the Serb minority living in Bosnia also resisted Independence rising up to assist the Yugoslav Army in suppressing the new bosniak government led by Ultra nationalist Radha van karadich the Bosnian serbs promised to split off from the bosniaks and maintain their own Breakaway State just as the Croatian serbs had done perhaps more confusingly the Bosnian croat minority also rose up to establish its own quasi-state though they remained on Cooperative terms with the bosniaks the Bosnian croats also received support from president franio tajman of Croatia as they fought off the Bosnian serbs supported by president milosevic the war would come quickly to Bosnia with the capital of Sarajevo being put under siege in April by the Yugoslav People's Army who continued to surround the city until early June when they evacuated handing the remainder of the siege over to the Bosnian serbs under Carnage later that year Federal forces would Retreat from Bosnia but left their weapons to the Bosnian serbs who pressed their assaults on many cities throughout the rest of Bosnia during October ethnic tensions between Bosnia and croats and bosniaks turned violent leading to the collapse of their Alliance soon after both factions were facing each other in open conflict leading Bosnia into a three-way War by early 1993 attempting to regain control over Croatian territory the bosnians would launch operation niritzvah in September of that year advancing along a 200 kilometer long front from gornivakov to the south of mastar the offensive yielded little success and eventually settled in a stalemate the croat bosniak war would be fully resolved in March 1994 when the two sides brokered a new piece and turned their focus back to combating Bosnian serbs during this chaos the city of Sarajevo had remained Under Siege by Bosnian serbs for almost two years the city suffered two especially devastating shellings on February 5th 1994 oath targeting the Markley Marketplace in the historic core of Sarajevo which led to the deaths of 68 people a day after the first massacre U.N Secretary General butrus boutrosgali formally requested NATO to confirm that airstrikes would be carried out against the procedures International pressure had forced Yugoslavia to suspend all financial and Military Support for the Bosnian serbs though this did little to quell their own offensives overall the siege of Sarajevo would last for a total of almost four years making it one of the longest sieges in modern warfare three times longer than the Battle of Stalingrad and a year longer than they see age of Leningrad if you would like to see this topic explored in further detail please consider subscribing to armchair history TV beyond the horrific war crimes on display much of the Yugoslav conflicts were noted for the level of involvement from the International Community the European community and the US helped facilitate treaties and peace negotiations wherever possible as conditions worsened in the region International involvement also took on more direct roles starting with the establishment of un-controlled demilitarized zones aimed at protecting ethnic minority enclaves or Areas with heavy civilian presence much criticism has since been levied against the UN who did little to enforce International rules or protect victims who were often subject to attempts at ethnic cleansing from paramilitary groups or forced to move on as refugees as the war continued the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would become involved in the war helping the UN enforce no-fly zones over critical areas like Bosnia and later Kosovo during the Banya Luca incident NATO Fighters shot down four Bosnian Serb Fighters for violating a no-fly zone making it the first combat operation in NATO history escalations between International forces and paramilitary groups also occurred like in April 1994 when U.S airstrikes against the Bosnian Serb command near garage day resulted in the retaliatory capture of over 150 U.N personnel as many as 400 NATO aircraft participated in the air campaign with a total of over 3 500 sorties flown and over 1020 bombs dropped on Bosnian served targets located across 48 complexes NATO aircraft struck 97 of their targets and seriously damaged more than 80 percent of them a factor that forced the Bosnian serbs to lift the siege of Sarajevo once and for all the war in Croatia would end in 1995 following operation flash and operation storm with Croatia reclaiming all of its territory back from the Croatian serbs except the East portion of slavonia that bordered Serbia most of the Serb population in the reclaimed areas fled and became refugees while the areas of sector East unaffected by the Croatian military operations came under U.N Administration and were reintegrated into Croatia in 1998 under the terms of the erdot agreement in Bosnia combined bosniak croak ground advances and NATO airstrikes forced the Bosnian serbs to lift their Siege and eventually come to the negotiating table the war ended with the signing of the Dayton agreement on the 14th of December 1995 with the formation of the Republica serbska as an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina Yugoslavia would also recognize Croatia's Independence along with Bosnia and herzegovina's in 1996. [Music] as the conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia were drawing to a close a new crisis opened up in the autonomous region of Serbia known as Kosovo historically Kosovo was populated by a majority of ethnic albanians though it also has shared a sizable Serb minority since 1989 Kosovo albanians had been attempting to resist repressive political actions from the Serbian president beginning first as non-violent movements however by 1996 an ethnic Albanian paramilitary group known as the Kosovo Liberation Army or KLA would attack Serbian police forces in retaliation for the abuse and murder of Albanian civilians as negotiations for peace failed violence continued to escalate Yugoslav forces soon began a massive campaign of repression and expulsions of Kosovo albanians provoking a response from NATO air sorties which eventually forced the Yugoslav Army to pull out of the region in 1999. while Kosovo officially remained a part of Yugoslavia it was independent in all but name the kosovans would eventually declare independence in 2008 but only achieved limited recognition with around 100 U.N members recognizing their state the end of the Kosovo War would also Mark the end of milosevic who would be overthrown in the bulldozer Revolution on October 5th 2000. Albanian troubles would not end in Kosovo soldiers from the recently disbanded KLA would go on to join other ethnic Albanian paramilitaries such as the Liberation Army of procival medveta and boyanovich who fought against Federal forces in the proshavo valley between 1991 and 2001. former KLA members also joined the Macedonian Insurgency that erupted in 2001 with fighters of the Albanian National Liberation Army attacking these Security Forces belonging to the Republic of Macedonia this conflict lasted throughout most of the year and overall casualties remained limited to several dozen individuals on either side conflict was ended by the orid agreement which was brokered by NATO giving greater political rights to Macedonian albanians which to this day make up about a quarter of North macedonia's population towards the mid to late 2000s repercussions for the crimes committed throughout the wars began to take effect through the international criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia since its establishment in 1993 over 161 persons have been indicted with many fugitives passing final judgment among the most notable cases were radhavan kardich ramush haradinai and Slobodan prayak with the latter famously committing suicide in the courtroom upon rejecting his verdict the last fugitive of the conflict Goran hajich was arrested in 2011. however despite these convictions many problems still persist in the region millions of weapons are estimated to be in circulation among the civilian population with many making their way onto the black arms markets more disturbingly some of these weapons have been connected to crimes committed in other parts of Europe such as the 2015 attacks in Paris and Gothenburg drug trafficking remains a constant problem especially among elements of the KLA and organized crime that took advantage of the chaos during the wars Infamous for the atrocities and destruction memories of the Yugoslav wars still cut deep for many left affected to this day estimates put the number of killed across each War at 140 000 with 2.4 million left as refugees and an additional 2 million internally displaced many post-jugoslav nations now strive for integration with the European Union hoping to move on from their dark past but challenges of unresolved crimes and ethnic divide remain ever present to this day foreign thank you\",\n",
       " \" the Battle of bakmut in Ukraine has gained notoriety for being the bloodiest and most destructive Urban battle since the second world war however not too long before bakmut there was another major Urban battle with thousands of combatants Untold destruction and many months of bitter fighting I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian and today we are going to take a closer look at the infamous battle of mosul in 2014 Iraq found itself in a period of immense upheaval as it licked its wounds from the american-led war within its borders that had started a little over a decade prior the Arab Spring of 2011 and the subsequent eruption of Civil War in neighboring Syria had severely destabilized the region and the two countries had become breeding grounds for radicalism in 2014 the situation exploded when the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria were Isis a large heavily armed group of radicals formerly aligned with Al-Qaeda seized the city of mosul triumphant its leader Abu Bakr al-baghdadi declared the beginning of a new caliphate within a matter of months Isis tentacles spread across large swaths of territory in both Iraq and Syria leaving a trail of terror destruction and death in their wake Isis abject barbarism and authoritarian rule decimated urban populations killing many and causing countless more to flee after only two years of subjugation mosul's population had dwindled from its original 2.5 to 1.5 million inhabitants before we continue I'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video Opera their latest browser Opera 1 improved my productivity by making

available the caliphate's rise did not go unchallenged the Iraqi government together with Allied militias Kurdish troops and international forces launched a sustained military effort to reclaim its lost territory by 2016 Isis had been systematically pushed back and was now forced to make a final stand in the city where its reign of terror had begun with over one hundred thousand Iraqi and Kurdish soldiers set to clash with around 10 000 of baghdadi's men the coming battle would be the final major Showdown with the extremist organization and would Mark the largest military operation since the US's 2003 invasion of Iraq anticipation Rose in the weeks leading up to the offensive as U.S led Coalition airstrikes paved the way for the upcoming ground assault leaflets were dropped on mosul encouraging young male residents to rise up against their oppressors when the battle began in response Isis fortified the city and its surrounding Villages by building an elaborate tunnel system and planting IEDs and landmines along the roads as Isis scrambled for what was to become its own Battle of Berlin the coalition's ground forces initiated its attack on October 16th from three separate fronts the initial push was a stunning success with 20 Villages claimed to have been liberated within the first 24 hours of fighting to the east Kurdish forces had Advanced with ease while Iraqi troops and militia coming up from the south faced somewhat tougher resistance the rapid Advance however was short-lived and soon the Coalition found itself slowed down by suicide bombers IEDs snipers and oil fires which hampered visibility to make matters worse to the Northeast efforts to retake the town of pasheka had to be delayed due to a lack of logistical support in the South however the Iraqi Army resumed its Advance on October 19th surrounding the town of karakash and reportedly advancing to within six kilometers of these City's outskirts signs of panic were observed in mosul as many Isis leaders were reported to be fleeing the city those that chose to stay behind were primarily expected to be foreign Fighters and others with little left to lose on October 20th the arrival of a large Convoy of Iraqi Special Forces known as the golden division marked an escalation in the fighting it's expertly trained veteran troops reinforced the Kurds to the East and reportedly eliminated around 200 Isis fighters in their subsequent capture of bartella foreign retaliation baghdadi's Furious Men set the almish rock sulfur plant on fire causing two deaths and nearly 1 000 hospitalizations due to fume inhalation in another feudal attempt to stem the coalition's advance Isis Fighters launched a failed diversionary attack on carecut but its forces were repelled the next day the coalition's advance remained Relentless by October 24th 800 Isis Fighters had been reported killed while 78 Villages had been liberated a day later elements of the golden division Advanced within two kilometers of the city where they paused to wait for reinforcements knowing that the assault on the city proper was imminent desperate Isis Fighters forced tens of thousands of civilians living in and around the city to serve as human Shields with reports that those who refused were executed with mosul's population being majority Sunni Muslims the Shia dominated Iraq government feared that tensions between the two groups could explode as such it was decided that only the Iraqi Army would operate in mosul proper while supporting militias would be ordered to remain within the city's outskirts Dawn on November 1st Coalition forces commenced their assault on the eastern part of the city air artillery tank and machine gun fire opened up on known Isis positions in the karma District as the extremists burned tires in hopes of reducing the enemy's visibility despite their best efforts Isis Fighters could do little to stem the coalition's advance by the next day resistance in the Eastern section of gojali was reduced to a few Pockets while Coalition troops managed to cut these supply lines from mosul to raqqa poor weather conditions however threw a wrench in the works and temporarily halted the assault moreover continued heavy resistance forced the Iraqi Army to temporarily withdraw from the Karam District a few days later still the offensive was stated to be ahead of schedule with the Iraqi Army's ninth Armored Division entering the neighborhood of al-antiasar on the third and six more districts being liberated on the fourth two days later Iraqi forces in the southwestern front reported that they had recaptured hamam al-alil and were now just four kilometers from mosul International Airport [Music] despite these successes few in the upper echelons of the coalition's leadership believed that their forces would be able to keep up at this pace of Advance the protection of civilian life and infrastructure had been given top priority which meant that their troops had to be extra careful as they moved deeper into the city regardless Coalition forces were determined to make their hated enemy pay for their misdeeds and on November 7th Kurdish horses backed by Coalition airstrikes renewed their three-pronged offensive to liberate the encircled town of pesheka most of the town was recaptured on the same day though a small contingent of the remaining 1 to 200 Isis Fighters defending basheka continued to resist until the end of the month similarly the golden Division and elements of the ninth division began clearing the recently liberated neighborhoods and screening fleeing residents for any suspected Isis members hiding among them by the end of the month it was assessed that Coalition forces had secured 19 neighborhoods or about 30 percent of Eastern mosul in the meantime the coalition's Air Force had initiated a concerted effort to destroy four out of the five bridges over the river Tigris in an effort to increasingly isolate remaining Isis fighters in eastern mosul from their compatriots on the other side of the river on December 6th Coalition forces with heavy air support launched an assault on the final strategic Old Bridge while Isis troops counter-attacked near al-salam though the counter-stroke failed to Halt the advance of Iraqi troops in the area a bitter fight for the al-salam hospital ended in a coalition defeat with 20 Iraqi Vehicles destroyed or disabled with about a quarter of the city now liberated the coalition's assault was beginning to run out of steam and on December 21st Iraqi forces entered a planned operational refit to repair Vehicles resupply ammunition and prepare for the next phase of the battle on December 27th Coalition warplanes finally bombed the old bridge effectively cutting off East from West mosul the second phase of the operation began two days later and it aimed to seize the remaining Isis controlled districts in eastern mosul heavy clashes erupted during the assaults at the Southeastern and Northern fronts and the advance was slowed down further due to difficulties in distinguishing between civilians and enemy forces as a consequence civilian casualties began to rise as Coalition forces cleared out the remaining districts on January 6th Iraqi troops entered mosul from the north when they crossed the AL kawasar River and stormed the al-butana district two days later Isis Fighters launched a counter-attack against Iraqi forces advancing toward the sukhar and belladiat but its forces were decimated in the face of heavy resistance and strong enemy air support in the meantime elements of the ninth Division and the federal police made a lunge for the Sumer and domes districts and in doing so were the first Coalition troops to reach the Eastern Bank of the Tigris River with Isis defenses showing signs of collapse the battle for Eastern mosul was now drawing to a close attention now shifted to the third and final objective of the offensive the capture of Western mosul many however were well aware that this assault on the caliphate's historical birthplace would be their toughest yet and the coalition's men would have to be prepared to face everything Isis could throw at them with the collapse of the Isis foothold on the eastern shore of the Tigris swaths of surviving Isis Fighters made a desperate attempt to cross the river under heavy fire in a flotilla of some 90 boats and three barges on February 19th Coalition forces were refitted and ready to embark on the final step of their offensive with the help of air support as well as the on-ground advisors the Iraqi and Kurdish forces Advanced into Western mosul the first major strategic point to fall was mosul International Airport which was seized by Iraqi forces on February 24th heavy fighting continued during the following week including an Isis chemical mortar attack in eastern mosul which injured 12 people bad weather also hampered the offensive but by March 7th the rapid response division reported that it had captured the Nineveh governorate complex as well as the mosul museum a central bank branch and Isis main Judicial Court in the process the following districts also had fallen under Iraqi control together making up around 60 percent of Western mosul the fate of the remaining Isis militants in the city would be sealed on March 12th when the U.S Envoy reported that Iraqi troops had cut all roads into Western mosul with these cities surrounded and with more and more major landmarks falling into the coalition's hands the fighting gradually moved into the ever tighter confines of the old city dozens of civilians were buried under Rubble during the ensuing fighting which rapidly transformed into a bitter block by block struggle bad weather grounding aircraft once again delayed the operation during the end of March but even with air support the going was tough Deliverance for trapped civilians came on April 18th in the form of a pontoon bridge over the Tigris close to half a million civilians would manage to escape the fighting during the next two weeks Isis fighters in the meantime continued to hold no such regard for humanitarian concerns as they fired a rocket containing a mustard agent at an Iraqi unit accompanied by American and Australian advisors injuring 25 soldiers by May 16th Coalition forces controlled close to 90 percent of Western mosul however the struggled to recapture the remainder of the city became tougher still as it seems that nearly every house and Street concealed suicide bombers or booby traps of some kind the remaining militants even began using women as suicide bombers hiding among civilians trying to flee the city leading to the deaths of dozens of non-combatants [Music] Iraqi forces launched their final assault on The Old City on June 18th where it was reported that Isis still held tens of thousands of civilians as human Shields three days later a great explosion echoed through the city the great Mosque of al-nori the place where al-baghdadi had declared the Isis caliphate in 2014 had been blown up although Isis tried to claim that the mosque had been destroyed by a U.S airstrike the blast indicated that explosives had been deliberately planted within its walls this Final Act of desperation marked the beginning of the end for the remaining Fighters Iraqi officials proclaimed Victory on July 10 but localized heavy fighting in the old city would not cease until the final pockets of isolated Fighters were eliminated two weeks later after the guns had fallen silent the Battle of mosul would enter the history books as the deadliest and the most destructive Urban battle since the second world war after some nine months of bitter fighting around 6 000 Iraqi Kurdish soldiers had become casualties on the coalition's side while around 10 000 Isis militants had perished in the fighting civilian casualties were worse still with over 12 000 civilians caught in a crossfire Isis however had been dealt a fatal Blow from which it would not be able to recover the caliphate's influence in the region waned and al-baghdadi himself would die during a U.S Special Forces raid two years later still the trauma and destruction which Isis had wrought left permanent scars on the region with entire cities like mosul left in Ruins and with thousands of families decimated and Scattered it will take many years for both Iraq and Syria to recover from this catastrophe\",\n",

through the shadows of occupied Europe these images all have one thing in common however their protagonists are universally Anglo-Saxon in reality the second world war was a clash of Empires Empires who called upon all of their people to take up arms and fight for the survival of their Dominion for the British Empire this included over 370 million people of India their largest colony and the much touted jewel in the Imperial Crown in today's episode we'll take a look at the Second World War from the perspective of the jewel rather than the head that wore it and how this conflict realized

stratified body with a white ruling class held above the Native Indians the caste system assisted in maintaining social control White's only businesses were common and Indian people were even prohibited from entering certain districts of cities in their own country despite these prohibitions a kind of Indian middle class developed professionals who managed to work within the system to find some measure of security and prosperity a young Gandhi belonged to this class as an up-and-coming lawyer however the vast majority of Indians were to put it mildly dissatisfied with the system perhaps sensing the rising tide of anti-colonial sentiment the Raj began a policy of indianization in the 1920s and 30s which saw more and more Native Indians placed in government and Military positions a particular note was the introduction of Indian officers to the local military forces which until this point had been under exclusively white command these native officers were often placed in charge of all Indian units while on their face these reforms were billed as steps towards self-rule and Indian success the reality was that they were token concessions to silence nationalist Rumblings a way for the British to simultaneously mollify their critics and maintain control Britannia rules the Indians as they rule the waves this was to the raja's mind a fact the second world war would put this fact to the test the fall of Poland in 1939 brought the infamous sitzkrieg and eight months of little change to the subcontinent this gave the people of India time to reflect time to begin seeing the war in Europe as a far-off matter a news item that wouldn't touch their Homeland like the United States India was thousands of miles from Europe protected by sea and desert mountain and plain being in India was like being in a grandstand watching some game or other according to British Civil Service Officer hey McDonald 's attitude was not a popular one however many of his compatriots were firmly fixed on joining the coming fight thus the British ordered the Indian army mobilized at the start of the war in 1939 with Viceroy of India Lord lindlethko believing wholeheartedly that the Indian people would sign on in droves to fight for democracy and freedom King and Country indeed one group of Native Indians came flocking to the Union Jack the wealthy maharajas of the princely states within the structure of the Raj roughly one-third of the native population was ruled over by Indian princes who administered fiefdoms in the Empire's name when Lynn Lithgow called the maharajas saw an opportunity to shore up their power in the face of the rising Indian independence movement the princes viewed Indian Nationalism as an existential threat and hoped that by eagerly and vigorously supporting the British crown their survival would be guaranteed in an independent India revolutions even peaceful ones are often unkind to the crowned heads the princes raised battalions of infantry and artillery or funneled their wealth into the British war chest scores of princes writing six-figure checks to the British Air Ministry and other departments with their men and their money these old Royals hoped to preserve their preeminence in Indian Society be it under British rule or in a free Indian state average Indians were equally interested in the conflict and public opinion was surprisingly varied over who was in the right India at this time included a variety of ethnic and religious groups groups that did not always coexist peacefully the cause of Indian independence sometimes ran along these religious and ethnic lines and Hitler's idea of racial Purity found willing adoptees in the militant wings of the Indian independence movement such hitlerians included the rashtriya swayam Seva sank Hindu nationalist group who openly celebrated Adolf Hitler and his desire for racial Purity as well as his methods in obtaining it meanwhile those Indians who favored the Allies found themselves increasingly frustrated with the British who should have been their compatriots while Indian politicians were anxious to defend their homes and promote their people's Prosperity the British showed interest in India solely as a well of Manpower from which to draw Colonial troops hopes of a new cooperation came in 1940 when the British and Indian governments reached an astonishing agreement London would pay for the entirety of India's War expenses and flood The Colony with investment the British would foot the bill for Recruitment and transport of Indian soldiers and bankroll sweeping infrastructure improvements but London's generosity proved Hollow the British paid their debts with Sterling credits essentially government ious that forced India to front the actual money devastating the Indian economy when the British government enacted the defense of India act granting government officials unlimited power to crack down on any sentiment speech or action they considered disloyal the Imperial government's priorities were spelled out focus on the war and keep India under political and economic controlled while the British worked to consolidate control on the home front Indian soldiers found their life in the field surprisingly varied these social dynamics of some units were perfect mirrors of the Raj with white officers enforcing a kind of de facto segregation disputes broke out over paid discrepancies between white and Indian officers of equal rank the content of ration tins and even whether radios should be tuned to Western or Indian musical stations while this form of petty racially driven office politics was the rule in some units others turned out to be surprisingly Progressive for the era a common rule for these units was the Prohibition of speaking in derogatory terms in the presence of Indian officers about their political leaders Customs Traditions or music While others accepted their Indian peers of their own accord once they'd proven their medal and competence in the field this attitude began to work its way up to the lines with the Infantry committee pending a report Midway through the war identifying segregation within units as a critical issue the most strenuous efforts must be made to ensure that no discrimination of any nature is permitted by the end of the war 2.5 million Indians would fight for the British Empire providing a critical component of the Allied Forces that defeated the Axis powers powers that succeeded in bringing the war to India's doorstep Imperial Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor was like a bucket of icy water dumped onto India's head up till now the people of India thought the second world war would play out much like the first with Indian troops sent to far-off lands and the subcontinent spared of actual fighting the Japanese were all too happy to disabuse India of this notion and Pearl Harbor was followed by an East Asian Blitzkrieg that toppled colonial government after colonial government the Japanese carved a beachhead into India's neighbor Burma and seized Hong Kong Singapore and British Malaya India therefore became a crucial staging ground for the Allies in the Pacific and refugees fled the Japanese advance for the perceived safety of the Raj a flow which only intensified after the Japanese captured the Burmese capital in March by the end of the month the Japanese had captured all of Burma and cut the critical Overland Supply route from India to China Burma's fall opened India up to a direct Japanese invasion with Bengal first on the Block Panic swept through this province in this desperate hour as their Imperial subjects were racked with fear the British Welsh stepped in to restore calm by enacting a scorched Earth policy that devastated the civilian population food stockpiles were seized by government forces Bridges were destroyed civilian watercraft confiscated or sunk waterways sabotaged if the Japanese invaded Bengal they would inherit a ruin however the Japanese had reached the end of their supply lines in Burma and were unable to advance in India so they bombed it as British soldiers sacked what they should have been defending and Japanese ordinance fell from the sky the people of Bengal found themselves straddling a tightrope over the bottomless Chasm of starvation fishermen had no craft with which to ply their trade Farmers had no crops Norway to get them to Market if they did in 1942 the ravening claws of hunger would snare India in their clutches the Bengal famine had begun the famine was a tragedy within a tragedy an epidemic of hunger and disease that saw between two to three million people die while the dominant narrative for some time has been that extreme weather was a leading cause of the tragedy more modern research seems to indicate British policies in India as the chief cause of the famine Indian American scientist and journalist madushri Mukherjee posits that over exploitation of Indian Resources by British leadership directly caused the famine with London continuing to pull tons of rice from India even as leaders of the Raj begged for emergency food Aid [Music] hordes of refugees from Burma poured into India increasing demand for what food was available fungus devastated rice crops severely limiting edible produce British industrialists and landowners intervened engaging in profiteering during the crisis freak weather devastated farmland and wiped out Villages and lastly though not exhaustively the Raj made great efforts to keep the famine out of the press which prevented the possibility of international Aid that could have saved lives what is beyond debate is the devastating impact the famine had on the people of Bengal the British inquiry into the famine noted a breakdown of family units as husbands deserted wives and wives husbands elderly dependents were left behind in villages babies and young children were sometimes abandoned historian Dr Janam Mukherjee describes the hellscape that Bengal became corpses lay scattered over several thousand square miles of devastated land 7 400 Villages were partly were wholly destroyed by the storm cholera dysentery and other waterborne diseases flourished as the Japanese postured and people starved in the streets social pressures began to mount politics in India did not stop with the declaration of war and Indian Nationalism only intensified as British administrators fumbled and fumbled again the discussion was dominated by Mahatma Gandhi's Indian National Congress drawn from the Hindu majority of Indians and Muhammad Ali jinnah's Muslim League who feared becoming second-class citizens in an independent India As Time wore on the Inc began to emphasize Hinduism as a critical component to Indian Society leading to the Muslim League's Lahore resolution calling for separate Muslim and Hindu States this marked the effective end of cooperation between the two and Indian nationalists were driven into the arms of militant extremist leaders these included pro-axis forces such as the Indian national Army led by subhas Chandra Bose Bose grew the Ina to 43 000 members at its peak rallying the disaffected Indians with his promise give me blood and I will give you Freedom the Ina would go on to fight in Burma against the British collaborating with the Japanese until the wars end other Indians chose less drastic methods of expressing their displeasure with the British as numbers of British and American troops in India swelled cultural clashes and outright crime ensued American troops began slaughtering cattle held sacred in Hinduism while allegations of sexual assault scandalized the Indian population Gandhi and the Inc responded by issuing the quit India resolution in August of 1942 a largely symbolic call for India to seize cooperation with the British until they guaranteed Independence the British responded by arresting Gandhi and many Inc leaders who they would hold for three years Gandhi even from prison exhorted his followers to peaceful protest instead the Indian independence movement chose violence protests in Bombay saw 33 people killed by police in the four days following the Inc leadership's arrest and a wave of attacks on government buildings ensued the British cracked down hard and 2 500 Indians were killed the Raj ultimately succeeded in putting down the Insurrection and Indian independence would have to wait until the war was won while the British fought the Indian people the Japanese fought the Indian army Indian troops managed to reclaim some of Burma in December of 1942 and the Japanese responded by bombing Calcutta for several days most of 1943 in India would be dedicated to reorganization and rearming of the Indian army as the Japanese had taught the Raj a bloody lesson they were not ready to face the Japanese in open battle while troops in the subcontinent readied to defend their home Indians abroad helped liberate North Africa before participating in operation husky seeing action throughout Sicily as 1943 Drew to a close the reinvigorated Indian army prepared to March against the Japanese the Japanese watched the Indian revitalization with concern and decided they needed to once again launch a surprise attack to keep the initiative in March of 1944 they enacted their plan dubbed operation Hugo which saw intense fighting on the Burmese border the Indians stood against the Japanese at the border towns of imphal and kohima the determined Indians stood their ground against the Japanese invasion and come July their foe had no choice but to break off the attack the Indian national Army under Bose fought in the Japanese attack and along with civilian collaborators rendered Aid and comfort to the retreating Japanese allies gave Chase to the Japanese and encountered these collaborators they chose honey over vinegar sending doctors and Food Supplies to the isolated Villages that had helped the Japanese in this way they hoped to win the locals back to the Allied side rather than punish them for collaborating August brought an ally Drive deep into Burma and the Bloody and brutal campaign to liberate the country merits its own video regardless May of 1945 saw the Indian army successfully capture the Burmese capital for India the war was over and at the end could not have come soon enough food shortages were rampant even after the official end of the Bengal famine in 1944 and basic necessities like cloth were in equally short supply demobilization meant an epidemic of unemployment as War workers were unceremoniously laid off members of the Ina were arrested and interrogated but public outcry saw many of them spared prosecution some Indians saw the Ina as a legitimate member of the independence movement rather than Japanese quizlings speaking of Independence the British agreed to discussions with Indian leaders regarding the possibility of Indian statehood and released political prisoners as an opening gesture including Gandhi Independence soon became an inevitability and Indian statehood talks opened tensions between Hindus and Muslims were a key issue of the negotiations leading to an agreement to partition the colonial territory into the Hindu state of India and the Muslim states of Pakistan and East Pakistan now known as Bangladesh the results of these negotiations are outside the scope of our discussion today but suffice to say the liberated Colony would experience some Growing Pains India would go into the second world war as a colony and emerge a pair of Nations [Music] in terms of military dead India lost 87 000 soldiers in the fight against the axis but accounting for civilian dead in the Bengal famine and other incidents the death toll Rises to a staggering 2.2 million at a minimum the Indian economy was devastated by the war despite being on the winning side and the country remains economically troubled into the modern day nevertheless India was able to throw off the shackles of colonialism kicking off a wave of decolonization in the aftermath of the second world war it is no hyperbole to say that Indian troops and material were a substantial contribution to the total Allied war effort a contribution paid for in the spilled blood and empty stomachs of those living on the subcontinent Western history says that the Second World War Began on September 1st 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany but the Republic of China had fought Imperial Japanese aggression for a full eight years before the first panzers rolled into Poland and China would spend the war Riven with internal strife even as they beat back the Japanese Imperial Japan first brought conflict to China with the 1931 invasion of Manchuria but this Conquest did not satiate their colonial Ambitions and the Empire thus began rattling the metaphorical Katana around Shanghai in 1932 before invading The jehol Province the following year 1936 would see the Japanese and Nazi Germany signed the anti-common turn pact and Chinese dictator Chiang Kai-shek began courting German support for his internal struggle against the Chinese Communist party or CCP who were quickly winning the hearts and Minds that his Chinese nationalist movement or cuomintang could not but ideological agreement did not bring peace as the Japanese moved on the soyuan province even as the Chinese and Germans traded anti-communist messages open War in China would break out following the Marco Polo Bridge incident in 1937 where Chinese and Japanese forces on the outskirts of pay King exchanged fire after Japanese troops crossed into Chinese territory in a naked provocation a full-scale invasion of the Republic of China ensued the Chinese were horribly outmatched the Republic of China fielded expansive numbers of infantry with precious few tanks or artillery to support them and scarcely a Navy or Air Force journalist Doo Zhong Yuan chronicled the struggles of Chinese troops each day they only got one meal because the supply transport Corps were so often bombed by enemy aircraft but what I felt saddest about was that when our side withdrew a lot of our seriously wounded Brothers had no one to look after them please tell me what are we fighting for finding both their backs to the wall the kuomintang and CCP would put aside their differences to form the second united front Mao Zedong himself declared all political parties and groups in the united front must help each other and make Mutual concessions for the sake of long-term cooperation but the newly christened war of Liberation against Japan would prove costly and the United Chinese were driven into a desperate fighting Retreat that lost the cities of Shanghai Hangzhou and Nan king among others the Japanese were brutal in their conquests and Nanking in particular would devolve into a carnival of depravity as Japanese soldiers committed crimes against humanity including the assault of Chinese women Slaughter of infants and other Horrors beyond comprehension the Japanese campaign of atrocities and Nanking is well known but the situation was Grim even before Japanese forces breached the Nationalist Capital Nan King was swollen with refugees who competed with locals for what scarce resources were available the situation became so dire that in the Nanking safety zone food Aid began to only be doled out for payment of a token fee though the poorest refugees were given Red tags to mark them as in need of free food [Music] thank you sanitation was non-existent with waste littering the city and building up inside houses with their soldiers marking up defeat after defeat and hope draining by the instant the literal stench of War hung over Nanking [Music] a Survivor who was 22 at the time recounted the Japanese crimes soldiers came to round people up after detaining us the Japanese soldiers took the three of us to a Riverside the moment we reached the Riverside the other two were hacked to death with swords [Music] one of them struck me with a sword at the back of my neck causing me to fall to the ground instantly still conscious I bit hard at the collar of the shabby Overcoat I was wearing to hold my breath in order to feign being hacked to death besides the wholesale Slaughter of General civilians it is estimated that over 20 000 women were victimized by the Japanese within the first month after Nan King's fall obtaining an exact number is Complicated by twin tragedies many women were killed following their assault while still others remained silent about their ordeal until their last days twenty thousand men were executed on false charges of being Chinese soldiers while thirty thousand actual Chinese troops were executed after capture in flagrant violation of international law but as the shattered brutalized city of Nanking settled into the rhythms of occupation in the Guangzhou newspaper an article on April 1st 1938 read after occupying the government organizations they spread out to conduct searches wantingly slaughtering our civilians civilians with shaved heads or other resemblance to a soldier were tied up without exception the situation appeared Bleak as Regional warlord turned nationalist General Han fuku ignored orders from Central Command and retreated from jianan to preserve his forces this led to the Japanese capturing of qingdao in January 1938 resulting in Han's execution on January 24th by a now Furious Chiang Kai-shek with Japanese forces occupying the north of Shandong in March the Yellow River defense line collapsed still the Chinese put up a stubborn resistance with reinforcements from Lee zongren's Army managing to humiliate the Japanese in the battle of terjong thank you meanwhile Japanese atrocities had driven many Chinese into joining the fight with the Communists under Mao Zedong seeing a significant boost in volunteers for his Red Army which Grew From 50 000 to 500 000 over 1937 to 1938 by August the Red Army were able to form the new fourth Army and eighth route Army which were incorporated into the second united front commanded by Chiang Kai-shek but Japanese victories in 1938 saw the Chinese pushed to their limits resulting in a desperate scorched Earth maneuver infamously known as the yellow river floods in June 1938 nationalist saboteurs intentionally destroyed the Yellow River dikes in order to slow down the Japanese invasion the resulting flood waters displaced millions of people and caused massive destruction of homes crops and infrastructure tens of thousands of people died as a result of the floods and the economic impact was felt for years to come the flood also had significant military consequences as it slowed down the Japanese advance and enabled the Chinese forces to regroup and strengthen their defenses ultimately however it only held off the Japanese for a time as they eventually captured these cities Amoy fuchau kaifang and Wuhan by the time nationalist forces had retreated to chonching in November prompted by Japanese brutalities U.S president Roosevelt gave the Chinese a liberty loan of 25 million dollars to help with recovery efforts British Burma also became a Chinese Supply Depot with the legendary Burma Road providing Overland transport of desperately needed supplies and materiel Chiang Kai-shek accepted foreign support with suspicion and sought to exploit his Western backers for his own ends despite their stance against Japanese aggression the kuomintang was far from a model of decency and throughout the war nationalist officials were notorious for embezzlement ineptitude and outright corruption deficits that would drive the Chinese people into the Open Arms of Mao Zedong 1939 would see the Chinese continue to lose territory and in 1940 the Japanese Consolidated their gains into a puppet state under ultra-conservative and anti-communist Wang Jin Wei who began pressuring the British to close the Burma Road that same year the U.S applied soft pressure to the Japanese embarking on limited iron and fuel embargoes that made their support of Chang's Republic inescapably clear but as it gained support from without the Republic found itself facing an old Enemy Within the second united front was an uneasy Alliance and the CCP grew increasingly impatient with having to take orders from the kuomintang who were aggravated in turn by highly successful CCP recruiting efforts in free China Chang's goal was to unite the people together under his flag alone 1941 would see the second united front collapse as the Communist new fourth Army fought kuomintang troops in what both sides claimed to be a traitorous ambush of their forces by the other side regardless of who ambushed whom 1941 would also see the Chinese begin to retake territory and turn the Japanese back in a defensive victory at the Second Battle of Changsha the empire was dealt another blow when the U.S Netherlands and Britain ended their trade in oil cutting Japan off from the world oil Market enraged and economically cornered the Japanese expanded their war of aggression bombing Pearl Harbor and launching their East Asian Blitzkrieg the sino-japanese war was now truly part of the second World War January 1942 saw the Japanese finally succeed in conquering Changsha and the Chinese defense became a scorched Earth one as the kuomintang and CCP withdrew they burned Bridges and stripped factories with many workers carrying off equipment in hopes of setting up shop in free China some Chinese troops withdrew to British India While others moved to reinforce defensive positions elsewhere in the country the Japanese would end the year capturing the city of Ley show which cut the Burma Road definitively Japan's attack on the United States and invasion of East Asia topped off a major crisis within the Chinese resistance despite the resistance once again fracturing along party lines both Nationalist and Communist forces continued to engage in Frontline actions guerrilla warfare sabotage and propaganda campaigns against the Japanese Invaders komentang leadership attempted to resupply and reorganize troops with the help of American and British allies although corruption within the Nationalist upper circles led to friction with the West American funds that had been intended for use against Japan were instead directed toward fighting Communist forces who were gaining influence throughout Southern China thanks to the Guerrilla efforts of the rebuilt new fourth Army under Commander Chan Yi as 1943 dawned the nationalists began rebuilding their forces in India but not without struggle sixty to seventy percent of inductees did not finish basic training with the majority deserting while a full 20 percent starved to death behind Allied lines over 100 million dollars in material and Aid given to them by the U.S was siphoned off to prepare for an eventual conflict with the CCP after the war despite their travails four divisions were successfully reformed in India and flown back to China where 16 000 Chinese defeated 60 000 Japanese at the Battle of chengda in the Hunan Province progress was also made in Burma with Chinese forces advancing in North Burma In late 1943 to besiege Japanese troops in mayakina 1944 would see Chang Lobby for a joint offensive to reopen the Burma Road growing tired of the need to fly in troops to India for every resupply effort as Allied Engineers pushed to build new supply lines across-friendly territory Chang's forces achieved numerous victories such as the capture of Mount song and Burma around June 1944 however efforts to reopen the Burma route were severely hampered by the launch of operation Ichigo a Japanese offensive designed to conclude the Chinese Theater once for all as the Japanese continued to press Ichigo the Chinese joined the multinational Burma campaign an epic series of battles and sieges that ended with the country liberated and the Burma Road opened once more the fighting in Burma would carry China through the end of the war and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki pan surrendered as the Soviets invaded Manchuria but the guns did not fall silent in the Middle Kingdom the corpse of Japanese imperialism was hardly cold before the equoman tang and CCP were once again at each other's throats [Music] thank you after the first world war Japan gained preeminence in the asia-pacific region winning support through their former Anton allies yet during the second world war Japan found itself fighting many of these nations while this situation was often chalked down to Imperial aggression the subject of Japan's expansion is a complex and often overlooked Story one that we will explore today for Japan the inter-war period was fraught with the same anxieties felt by countries all over the world the Great Depression had effectively crippled the economy with the collapse of World Trade and ineffective countermeasures sparking criticism from those who opposed the liberal capitalist system this led to Rising influence within Japan's far-right circles most importantly the military who by 1931 had instigated the mukden incident a false flag event that enabled Japan's quantong Army under General Shigeru Hangzhou to seize all of Manchuria establishing the puppet state of manchukwo which provided resources for the home islands and acted as a bolt work against the Soviet Far East which loomed ominously on the northern border shocked by the military's insubordination Japan's civilian government felt powerless to challenge the rapid victories gained from their Conquest which only empowered the military further by 1936 a series of assassinations and coup d'etat plots had been carried out by extremist elements known as the young officers their reign of terror helped embolden the influence of military staff within the Japanese cabinet and ultimately gained support for further military actions in China Japan's signing of the anti-common turn pact in November also secured the nation for their eventual conflict with the Soviet Union and notably The Pact changed Germany's Far East Asian policy which dropped support for China in favor of Japan while border skirmishes tested the medal of communist sovereignty in the north a new front was opened further south in July 1937 following the Marco Polo Bridge incident as ground forces from Japan's China Garrison Army poured into the P King tiansen region of China this incursion would escalate full scale into the second sino-japanese war or in Japanese simply the China incident as Chinese cities were decimated and pillaged Japanese relations with the West worsened significantly the West broadly condemned the atrocities committed by the Japanese military on Chinese civilians in an occupation they had first deemed illegal since the invasion of Manchuria along with the rising embargoes from the West the Japanese Army also suffered a humiliating defeat at calcan goal in September 1939 when the invading Japanese sixth Army was defeated in a series of pitched Battles by the Soviet Red Army despite this loss Germany's invasion of Poland looked like an opportunity to establish a new order in East Asia for the Japanese a broadcast on June 29 1940 by foreign minister arita hachiro advocated for the inclusion of various South Seas areas later developing into the greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere as Germany conquered Europe Japan set about acquiring the territories necessary for their co-prosperity beyond their gains in China Japan Incorporated French Indochina with German consent on September 22nd 1940 occupying the former colonies until the Vichy French authorities bowed to the Japanese demands four days later the next day Japan signed The tripartite Pact concluding a defensive alliance with Germany and Italy against the United States who by this time had sought to Japan's war effort with harsh sanctions and embargoes on much-needed resources like Machine Tools aviation fuel and scrap metal the need for these resources coupled with fears of an eventual Oil Embargo drove Japan further toward establishing their co-prosperity sphere which was deemed vital for the ongoing War in China at home the Japanese public were galvanized into support of the Empire through intense repression and propaganda anti-subversion laws and controls over the Intelligentsia were implemented to discourage liberal Tendencies education on all levels was revoked to indoctrinate the youth shaping them as future assets for Japanese Supremacy over Asia and the Pacific Imperial propagandists Incorporated Shinto religious traditions in this effort forming a state-sanctioned cult which served the Empire's interest first and foremost above all this Hirohito reigned as the Divine figurehead Emperor showa it was under his name that Japanese Fighters dedicated their famous Banzai Battle Cry charging recklessly into the enemy with bayonets swords or in the cockpit of a diving aircraft militarily resources of the co-prosperity sphere would be secured under a national resource Zone which stretched from Burma to melanesia to protect this Zone the newly conquered territories would be defended by the Army while the Navy secured its ocean Lanes this daunting task of Naval superiority in the Pacific was made attainable thanks to Japan withdrawing from the Washington Naval limitation treaty in 1937 giving the Navy ample time to construct some of the largest battleships ever built like the Yamato and the Musashi at the same time senior staff held doubts about these super battleships urging those in government to shift Focus toward air power and submarines needed for the National Defense Zone of those senior staff the most notable was its commander-in-chief Admiral isaroku Yamamoto who was a longtime believer in Naval Aviation something which played a key role in his plans for operation Z the attack on Pearl Harbor operation Z envisioned a preemptive strike on the U.S Pacific Fleet and her aircraft carriers taking advantage of a delayed American response to quickly invade and occupy all of the plant Southern resource zones with these natural resources secured and the Americans so suddenly brutalized it was believed that the Allies would leave Japan dominant over the Pacific however inter-service tensions brood over priorities of the war the Army remained adamant on the Chinese Theater and pushed to seize natural resources in the areas north of Manchuria the Navy instead advocated for the new South Sea areas and with the Army's loss of favor after calcan Gaul the Navy was given their opportunity want to keep up with community events and discussions check out our Discord server today on December 7 1941 combined elements of Japan's first air fleet attacked without a declaration of war 350 aircraft attacked Pearl Harbor and military bases on Oahu with the U.S Navy losing four battleships 188 aircraft and 2400 Sailors over the next four hours the Japanese Navy only lost 29 aircraft and 55 Pilots soon after Japan invaded the Philippines Singapore and the rest of Southeast Asia with Little Resistance from the Allied Nations the surprise nature of these invasions succeeded thanks to the competence of Japanese commanders with examples like the Malay operation under General tomoyuki yamashta seeing the entire Peninsula captured by the 25th Army in a blitzkrieg assault that lasted only 70 days on the home front a mixture of excitement and anxiety lingered among the public no Lantern parades rang out like after the capture of Nan King instead the Japanese expressed resolve in the face of a waking Giant for Admiral Yamamoto there was a great concern for the U.S aircraft carriers which had avoided destruction at Pearl Harbor this fear proved to be well founded after the USS Hornet penetrated the Western Pacific without alerting Japanese patrols and successfully launched a carrier strike over Tokyo in what became known as the Doolittle Raid in response the Army launched operation Sego ravaging the jejung zhangji region in China in search of the American Airmen who had taken shelter there after the raid a month later the Port Moresby operation was foiled after a strategic withdrawal following the Battle of the Coral Sea which marked the first time Japan's Navy had been stopped in its tracks Yamamoto was well aware of America's potential for total retaliation and sought to turn the tide by establishing a new base of operations to renew their attacks on U.S bases in Hawaii for this the Admiral first wished to trap the U.S Navy's remaining Pacific Fleet carriers and battleships at Midway atoll then established bases in the Aleutian Islands to prevent the U.S from conducting strategic bombing raids across the Northern Pacific the resources required to capture the Illusions diverted assets away from the attack at Midway with the surprise element becoming undone by U.S intelligence who broke Japanese Naval codes and hatched their own plans in preparation for the confrontation over the 4th to the 7th of June the Battle of Midway saw Japan's four premier aircraft carriers and a Heavy Cruiser destroyed along with the loss of 248 aircraft and the deaths of 3057 personnel from his Flagship Admiral matone ugaki recorded the tables had turned entirely and we are now forced to do our utmost to cope with the worst case this should be kept in mind as a lesson showing that war is not predictable despite the defeat at Midway inter-service rivalries once again reared its ugly head as the Army was misled about the battle's aftermath due to this the Army continued to believe for a short while that the fleet was in good condition for the enemy however these recent victories had given them the confidence and momentum needed to begin their island-hopping campaign Japanese military leadership were aware that their forces were not adjusting quickly enough to fit the new demands of combat attempts to update their Arsenal in 1942 were unsuccessful as the majority of weapons remain unchanged due to a lack of resources the Army's Focus shifted to securing occupied territories and controlling a widely dispersed military with the rush to produce equipment there was little time for quality control integration of improvements or improved Packaging the Japanese faced many material shortages which forced them to prioritize production for aircraft and ships at the cost of other much-needed armaments but even this was not enough in late 1942 allied Landings in Guadalcanal left the Japanese isolated into pockets of resistance allowing the Allies to bypass them for bigger targets over 1943 the Japanese defense of the occupied Gilbert and Marshall Islands was marked by Fierce fighting on both land and sea with the Japanese suffering heavy losses due to the superior Firepower of the Allied Forces by 1944 the Japanese Navy had lost Naval superiority after a crushing defeat in June during the battle of the Philippine Sea characterized as the largest carrier to carrier battle in history the lack of Japanese fire support was detrimental to their defense of the Mariana and Palau islands where the Japanese suffered heavy losses because of the Americans Superior Firepower and the Strategic bombing campaigns while the North China area Army under General akamura yatsutsuga thundered across China amid operation Ichigo General yamashta's defense of the occupied Philippines was crippled by another Naval defeat at the Battle of Leyte golf where the first organized use of Kamikaze attacks did little to sway the tide Japan's fighting Spirit remained tenacious with the Americans forced to contend with displays like that of General yoshitsugu saitos 4 300 man Bonsai charge during the Battle of Saipan a ferocious assault which decimated the American 105th Infantry Regiment at the cost of nearly all of its attackers despite their losses both the Army and Navy made it clear that the Americans would have to fight both tooth and nail for every island occupied by Japanese forces the rising failures of late 1944 to 1945 highlighted the military's desperate situation island hopping campaigns ground away Japanese garrisons leaving many abandoned to an honorable death like that of General tadamishi kiribayashi at the Battle of Iwo Jima offensive campaigns such as operation Hugo petered out before they were even began due to the severe lack of resources 1945 marked the final Turning Point as March saw the U.S launched a firebombing campaign across Tokyo devastating the city's industrial capacity and leaving a death toll of 80 000 to nearly 100 000 people with the Allied Forces closing in Japan found itself using all means necessary to defend the home Islands during the U.S invasion of Okinawa in June over 100 000 troops were stationed to defend the island inflicting some of the heaviest American casualties of the entire War which also came at a huge cost to the Japanese and Okinawan conscripts some estimates claim that up to half of the Island's population was killed forced to commit suicide or otherwise disappeared during the battle meanwhile Japan's second fleet was thrown at the Allies in a suicidal attack known as operation Tango which promptly failed after having their Naval codes once again decrypted by U.S intelligence despite a barrage of Kamikaze attacks the U.S fifth Fleet had sunk the Yamato and five of the other nine ships present at the battle the writing was on the wall Allied Forces called for the unconditional surrender of Japan at the Potsdam Conference on the 26th of July 1945 threatening refusal with prompt and utter disruption Japan's government ignored the Allies ultimatum leading to the decision by the United States with agreement from the United Kingdom to use the newly created atomic bombs against them the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki occurred on the 6th and 9th of August 1945 respectively leaving a collective death toll estimated to have killed hundreds of thousands both from the immediate detonation and radiation poisoning in the weeks and months after following the bombing of Hiroshima the Soviet Union declared war driving into Manchuria after the bombing of Nagasaki still Japan seemed poised to wager the lives of all of its people in the name of Empire only on August 15th after the unfamiliar voice of the emperor called out for peace did the War end\",\n",

the taliban's fall was Swift and brutal their fighting capability was obliterated by the Americans in a lightning war that decimated over 20 of its total forces by the end of 2002 and thoroughly destroyed the Emirate as a government entity despite this catastrophe the Taliban were eager to get back on their feet forming a number of committees in 2003 known as shiras these councils aimed to unite their scattered cadres still left Fighting by re-establishing a formal chain of command expanding Recruitment and strengthening Logistics a task made more difficult thanks to the new occupation of their country for the United Nations keeping stability in Afghanistan meant denying the Taliban any opportunity to exert their influence it was an Endeavor which required the assistance of all Allied nations in the Coalition it was because of this that the UN established the International Security assistance Force following the bond agreement in 2001. with NATO assuming Direct Control in August 2003 the isaf expanded gradually from its base in Kabul into the rest of the country provincial reconstruction teams were also created from multinational elements to Aid in stabilization development and most importantly extending the influence of Afghanistan's central government however the isaf soon began to stumble with several issues hindering their mission most critical of these was the lack of understanding when it came to ethnic tribal and political complexities cooperation with the post-taliban political order was also difficult due to rampant nepotism and tribal patronage in contrast the Taliban set about remobilizing their forces Taliban leaders traveled throughout their existing constituencies all across Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan inviting former members and others in their family to join the new Insurgency the prospect of nation building was not a welcome one for the Americans nor was the idea of staying there as a counter-insurgency force however the military recognized a need to consolidate gains through building local support as well as the necessity for counter-terrorism the mission was clear neutralize all militants associated with Al-Qaeda and find bin Laden U.S and Allied Special Forces now turned to counter-terrorism operations utilizing the same task forces involved in the initial Invasion while also establishing newer and more specialized groups to help find Targets across Afghanistan and Pakistan while effective these operations did have their downside U.S operators often mistakenly lumped Taliban leaders together with Al Qaeda despite any distinction or clear allegiances by their own admission Special Operations forces at the time neglected careful intelligence they were anxious to prosecute whatever leads came no matter how questionable the source analysts who warned that intelligence might be faulty were often overruled in the experience of one special forces team they recall a lot of operations ended with us capturing low-level leaders or people who were associated with the Taliban I don't think we ever caught anybody who was a confirmed Al-Qaeda member rather they were low-level Taliban operatives meanwhile the isaf was forced to contend with renewed offensives from the Taliban Insurgency who had grown more Brazen thanks to the motivation of their new recruits and jihadist militants spurred on by a fatwa issued by the Taliban in 2005 ordering the death of all infidels and others who supported the Afghan government between March and July insurgents targeted Canadian isaf soldiers throughout Kandahar and Mast near Kandahar City for a major attack British Asaf soldiers faced constant combat in Northern Helmand Province over the summer period however the Taliban were too self-assured and underestimated the isaf who fought back against many of these offensives and inflicted significant casualties despite isaf's success the increase of Taliban offensives raised issues of the coalition's lack of military footprint by 2006 their expansion into the south of Afghanistan confirmed fears that their budgetary focus on reconstruction and development had allowed a full-blown Insurgency to establish itself across sub-regions like pashmol in response NATO launched the first conventional Land Battle in its history on September 1st codenamed operation Medusa described by General David Julian Richards as a second world war style battle for Kandahar the two-week operation saw Canadian U.S and Afghan combat forces assaulting Taliban defensive positions with the assistance of British Danish Dutch and French combat support the operation was tactically successful with hundreds of insurgent casualties and no major Taliban operations that year however the Coalition forces were hampered by national governments representing their forces intervening on critical decisions and hindering necessary support which revealed direct limitations on the coalition's efficiency from 2006 to 2008 Coalition forces in Afghanistan Grew From 9000 to 51 000 troops with NATO using the success of operations like Medusa to adapt with the changing Conflict by 2008 the isaf footprint encompassed the whole country though a major shortfall in their operation was a continued National unwillingness to commit the full resources necessary for Success it was a concern that would continue to hamper the Americans even during their transition to the new Obama administration President Barack Obama quickly soured on The Afghan Mission being especially wary of the costs and uncertainty involved initially Obama opted to raise U.S troop levels in Afghanistan above the 100 000 mark for a limited period though he made it clear that U.S force levels from that high point would only go down strategy also changed as the increased use of remote drone missions took priority over the buildup of conventional land forces whereas the Bush Administration authorized 52 drone strikes outside the war theater in an eight-year period the Obama Administration authorized more than 10 times that number with 542 drone strikes killing almost 3 800 people from their kill or capture list suffice to say the change in approach was controversial with the use of signature strikes and other tactics garnering much criticism despite this Obama was convinced it was the right approach insisting this is a just War doing nothing is not an option as the larger Coalition built up in the region resurgent Taliban attacks led to the isaf launching a number of key operations all involving NATO and Afghan Security Forces throughout 2010 onwards the most prominent among these included operation moshtaric a 15 000 strong force tasked with pacifying sub-regions of helmandt Province operation hamkari aimed at securing Kandahar City and connecting its key districts and the more famous Operation Neptune Spear a controversial cia-led mission to capture Osama bin Laden this daring helicopter raid occurred on May 2nd 2011 when U.S Navy Seals entered Bin Laden's about a bad compound in Pakistan eliminating him almost as soon as they gained entry despite criticisms of Obama's policy up to this point few Americans objected to Bin Laden's death which ended a decade-long Manhunt following his escape from torabora back in 2001. in July 2011 the president affirmed his withdrawal of troops marking 2014 as the year of transition and 2016 as the deadline by which all U.S forces would be withdrawn in 2015 just over 9 800 troops were present yet this introduced a problem as the performance of Afghan Security Forces showed that they were not ready to pick up the slack from the departing U.S troops as International forces left the Taliban regained the initiative having expanded dramatically since 2003 despite their setbacks Military Intelligence estimated the number of Taliban fighters inside Afghanistan to be around 30 000 insurgents throughout 2010 to 2012. by 2015 their Manpower had reached over 200 000 men just a year after the isaf had been disbanded when the Taliban seized the city of condos in September Obama was forced to scrap plans to withdraw all U.S troops by the end of his term meanwhile the death of Mula Omar back in 2013 also led to the rise of succeeding commanders like akhtar Muhammad Mansour who was able to consolidate power and take control of the Taliban though his stint was brief having been killed in a drone strike authorized by the president this led to hiptola akunsada succeeding as the leader of the Taliban in May 2016. one month after the initiation of their own spring offensive codenamed operation Omari operation Omari involved capturing and holding major cities across Afghanistan despite successfully breaching the Frontline defense of the Afghan National Security forces and controlling a significant number of districts their offensive was blunted thanks to U.S air power and Special Operation Forces attempts to further seize strategic Afghan cities were thwarted by the combined U.S and Afghan Security Forces resulting in high Taliban casualties although operation Omari revealed severe weaknesses in the Afghan Armed Forces they did not bring the Taliban any closer to winning the war American counter-attacks and support prevented the Taliban from achieving their objectives and highlighted the limitations of their frontal assaults by January 2017 the direction of U.S strategy in Afghanistan would once again change as Donald Trump assumed presidency Trump was profoundly skeptical of foreign interventions though he was committed to decisive action against terrorism having criticized Obama's methodical strategy to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria he vowed to crush terrorism while refocusing resources on the United States in September U.S defense secretary James Mattis acknowledged the challenges faced in Afghanistan with the Taliban controlling 40 percent of the country and a third of its population the Trump Administration conducted a review and developed a strategy aiming to compel the Taliban to negotiate for peace from early 2018 to 2020 a series of failed ceasefires and renewed fighting alternated behind official Arrangements between the U.S Afghan government and Taliban forces to negotiate peace in February 2020 a peace deal was signed in Qatar before a large audience of diplomats from across the world the president was satisfied with the taliban's commitment though he wasn't around to see its completion following his defeat in the 2020 elections with Joe Biden assuming presidency in January 2021 the national mood had soured on Military intervention thanks to domestic issues such as the coronavirus pandemic and its subsequent economic downturn on July 8 2021 the president announced the full withdrawal of military forces from Afghanistan intending to honor the U.S Taliban agreement set by his predecessor inadvertently this commitment gave Taliban commanders an opportunity to seize on culminating in a rapid strategy of coercion and persuasion which saw many Afghan Security Forces surrendering to the Taliban as they Advanced on the capital with these surrender deals the last remnants of the U.S backed central government had effectively handed over entire provincial commands to their adversaries and put the militants back into Power two decades after they were defeated by the United States and its allies on August 14 2021 the Taliban entered the capital of Kabul with barely a shot fired a total of 122 000 people were evacuated from Afghanistan in one of the largest airlifts in history U.S casualties in the war included 2500 killed and over 20 000 wounded Taliban casualties were greater with roughly 100 000 killed and 150 000 wounded finally the civilian toll was more than 120 000 killed and wounded with many more becoming displaced as a result of the war after almost 20 years of conflict the

what we now call Taiwan is officially the Republic of China or Roc and is a direct result of the Chinese Civil War The ROC had been fighting Communists and other Warlords as far back as 1927. only briefly stopping to deal with the Japanese invasion that came a decade later this uneasy truce would collapse once the Japanese were defeated and the country would devolve into brutal fighting between the last surviving factions of the Civil War the nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists under Mao zadong's People's Republic of China or PRC eventually largely due to Soviet Aid the Communists would get the upper hand and by the end of 1949 the Nationalist front had collapsed in an effort to prevent being completely wiped out the nationalists would evacuate to Taiwan which had been under their control since Japan's defeat in 1940 35. besides Taiwan itself The ROC also retained control over several islands in the Taiwan Strait The kinman panghu and Matsu Islands seeking to continue their military successes in 1949 the Communists would try to invade kinmen this invasion is known as the Battle of guineto and was one of the earliest military confrontations between China and Taiwan after the Civil War's conclusion on the mainland the Communists launched a series of further attacks on kinman but the Taiwanese forces with the support of the United States were able to successfully defend the island this however did little to stop the Communists from shelling the island relentlessly for decades afterwards attacking it with ships fighter planes and frogsmen at one point in 1958 the fighting over kinman became so intense that the Americans deployed atomic bombs to an air base in southern Taiwan just in case the people's Liberation Army ever tried to invade in full force as evidenced in kenman U.S support is a crucial part of taiwan's defense strategy while initially taiwan's government was internationally recognized as the government of mainland China slowly but surely countries began switching to recognize the PRC and eventually a 1971 U.N resolution determined that the PRC would represent China worldwide even while the U.S eventually switched to recognize the PRC it still remained a staunch Taiwanese Ally something ever more crucial given taiwan's worsening diplomatic isolation from the perspective of Beijing the Chinese Civil War never ended so the two governments have no official relationship and are still ideologically and militarily hostile the PRC has long sought to Annex Taiwan under its One China principle which views taiwan's de facto Independence and democratic system of government as posing a threat to the ccp's right to rule China effectively Taiwan is portrayed as a renegade province in Taipei there is a shared sentiment regarding what they see as the Communists exercising a tyrannical grip over the mainland the situation is viewed as a zero-sum game because only one side can win meaning the other side must be vanquished while the U.S does not have a defense treaty with Taiwan the two countries enjoy a high level of military cooperation the U.S has been providing arms and Military Support to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act enacted in 1979 which has helped Taiwan protect its territorial interests throughout the late 20th century since 2004 the U.S military has had senior staff working as liaison Affair officers in the country and starting in 2017 Taiwanese Marines have trained with the U.S in Hawaii and U.S Marines have likewise been sent to train in Taiwan the recent increase in China's aggression toward Taiwan has also prompted more collaboration with NATO who have begun further engagement through educational institutions like the NATO defense college and NATO School oberamergow joint training exercises have also extended to Special Operation Forces with units like the U.S army first Special Forces Group having training exercises in Taiwan U.S support has also been more tangible as ongoing U.S Taiwan military cooperation resulted in Taiwanese access to U.S military sales some Acquisitions include p3c anti-submarine aircraft ah-64e attack helicopters and Perry class frigids in addition the U.S has also approved the sale of f-16s Abrams tanks and a variety of anti-tank and anti-air platforms besides the direct sale of equipment the U.S partnership has also allowed Taiwan to produce equipment on license development and systems management for the Taiwanese military is the responsibility of the National chongshan Institute of Science and Technology The Institute produces a combination of U.S licensed small arms and armored vehicles modified Small Arms platforms based on U.S designs and Indigenous weapons and armor systems one notable indigenous example would be the Thunderbolt 2000 mobile multiple launch rocket system designed to Target disembarking amphibious troops two other organizations under the ministry of National Defense participate in the manufacturing of small arms Munitions and armored vehicles the 205th Arsenal and the Ordnance Readiness Development Center given their partnership with the U.S and the West as a whole Taiwanese weapons today have taken a western approach in terms of style and look when it comes to their standard issue sidearm the Taiwanese are in the process of replacing their trusty m1911s with the t-75 which is based on the Beretta M92 furthermore the Taiwanese standard issue rifle the type 91 incorporates features that are fundamentally similar to the AR-15 platform while it is clear that the Taiwanese have managed to Garner a significant arsenal of reliable and efficient weapons none of this Hardware is of any use if it is not behind the hands of motivated and trained soldiers while the Civil War ended long ago Taiwan and China are still technically at War The Continuous threat of invasion has allowed Taiwan to mobilize its population gearing up for a confrontation against a much larger enemy while Taiwan implemented conscription for male citizens in the 1950s by the 1990s they began to transition from a large conscription-based Force to a smaller more professional one this change was driven by several factors including advances in military technology and a desire to increase the quality of recruits in 1999 Taiwan began reducing the length of compulsory military service reducing it by two months each year from 2004 to 2008 until the service period was finally settled at one year's service in 2013 it was further reduced to just four months of military training and three years of reserve duty in January 2023 the Taiwanese defense Ministry announced that it would allow women to volunteer for Reserve Force training citing efforts to address gender discrimination concerns as of 2021 women made up 15 percent of taiwan's military but served mostly in non-combat roles while the conscription length was reduced to just four months less than a decade ago in December of 2022 due to increasing military pressure from China president XI ingwen announced a reform known as the military force realignment plan that would resume one-year conscription from 2024 onwards another key feature of the reform was the division of the Armed Forces into four categories the categories include the main battle troops who would bear the primary burden of Frontline fighting the Garrison troops composed predominantly of conscripts serving in infrastructure protection and territorial defense roles and The Reserve System which is intended to replenish the main Battle Force with retired volunteer soldiers and the Garrison force with former conscripts the fourth and final category the civil defense system includes those deferred from combat service due to Medical conscientious or other reasons and is tasked with disaster relief medical services and with unspecified but presumably logistical Military Support operations traditionally given its role in the Civil War the Army had been the dominant service in the armed forces but that shifted as taiwan's military Doctrine became to keep any fighting as far from population centers as possible as a result the Army is only seen as relevant once the enemy lands on the island while the Navy and Air Force can operate in the strait the Republic of China Navy has transitioned from the most neglected arm of the Taiwanese military to the most important in 2014 the Navy had 26 large surface vessels all equipped with potent anti-ship capabilities at about ten thousand tons the largest ships in the fleet are the four key lung class guided missile destroyers formerly the U.S kid class destroyers the remaining large surface vessels are a mixture of American and French designs the Navy's utmost goal is to counter and deny a blockade or invasion and to maintain uninterrupted sea lines of communication to facilitate Homeland defense operations Taiwan security is threatened by China's increasing inventory of short medium and longer range ballistic missiles with improved accuracy and larger Warheads a relatively small number of these missiles could severely damage taiwan's ability to respond to an attack as a result the Republic of China Air Force plays a crucial role in any defense of the island the Air Force conducts combat air patrols to maintain security of airspace over the Taiwan Strait and carries out combat preparedness and training missions at roughly 19.3 billion dollars taiwan's 2023 defense budget represents roughly 2.44 of the GDP taiwan's Armed Forces number approximately 215 000 personnel plus around 2.3 million reservists this pales in contrast to China's Armed Forces which number over 2 million in active Personnel alone increasing political tensions between China and the West have led to an increase in Chinese military activity throughout the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea in April of 2023 China would even hold large-scale military exercises simulating a strike on key Targets in Taiwan in response to president Tsai ingwen's meeting with U.S House of Representative speaker Kevin McCarthy taiwan's foreign minister Joseph Wu has said that he is preparing for the possibility of a conflict with China in 2027 as U.S intelligence believes that Xi Jinping China's leader has ordered the country's military to be ready to Annex Taiwan by that year China has continued to encroach on Taiwan by sending fighter jets and navy vessels into Taiwanese Waters and air spaces on a near daily basis some U.S officials believe that a conflict may come soon but others say that predicting timelines for a conflict is guesswork while it is clear that Taiwan has managed to assemble a force prepared to meet an invasion let us hope that it is never tested\",\n",
       " \" the history of the German people is a Chronicle both complex as it is fascinating from the warring kingdoms of late Antiquity Germanic Lords converged under the Holy Roman Empire and its many banners yet the Germans remained distinct and fractured in a medley of independent cities thiefs and Petty kingdoms so how exactly did they arrive at the Modern Germany we see today I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian and today we will be looking at the evolution of German borders we begin in 1525 amidst the fervor of the Protestant Reformation following a conflict between the German Teutonic Knights and the kingdom of Poland the Treaty of Krakow was signed this treaty gave its Grand Master Albert of hohen zolern the autonomy to secularize the Teutonic order and transform its Prussian Holdings into a vassalized duchy under the Dominion of Poland as the first Duke of Prussia Albert established his capital in the city of koenigsberg fast forward to 1618 when the Prussian Hoenn solern Dynasty faced an upheaval in the male line as a result the Dougal title was passed on to the family's senior Branch based out of Brandenburg this Union solidified the connection between Brandenburg a thief of the Holy Roman Empire and dukul Prussia a Polish Thief more importantly the Brandenburg capital of Berlin became an integral part of Prussia over the 17th century Frederick William as duke of Prussia and Prince elector of Brandenburg sought to connect his disparate territories though his designs were Complicated by King Carl Gustav the 10th of Sweden who invaded Frederick's lands vassalizing the great elector in return for war support against the polls Gustav promised to cede his new vassal the provinces of helmno malborg Pomerania and varmia to which the prince elector agreed in 1657. in response to this threat King John Casimir II of Poland gave Frederick William a counter-offer promising him the territories of drachheim elbing laoenberg and Bhutto along with prussia's full Independence which Frederick William keenly accepted in 1657. with its independence secured Prussia was able to prosper later elevating from a duchy to a fully fledged Kingdom in 1701 with Frederick Williams grandson Frederick the first adopting the title King in Prussia from here the fledgling Kingdom began to establish itself among the empires of Europe during the Great Northern war the prussians secured the Swedish territory of Pomerania in 1720 with the prosperous Austrian province of Silesia becoming Incorporated in 1742 thanks to the Strategic prowess of Frederick II following the territorial deadlock of the Seven Years War King Frederick II wished to connect his territories much like his great-grandfather had wished over a century ago before we

teaming up with the austrians and Russians to cow the Polish into submission forcing them to cede further territory during the first partition of Poland this helped Frederick bridge the gap between East Prussia and Brandenburg from here Frederick could ratify his title fully and become the King of Prussia circumventing the legal loopholes imposed on his father by the Holy Roman Empire the beginning of the 19th century saw the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte and with it a brief pause on German fortunes it was during this period that Prussia would come to blows with the pint-sized potentate suffering the loss of more than half of its territory after the Treaty of tilsit in 1807 which mostly remained with the Russians even after Napoleon's defeat however not all was lost as the Congress of Vienna in 1814 gave Prussia the regions of yulik clavesberg and the lower Rhine following the French Empire's defeat which were more industrialized and thus more valuable the Congress also Consolidated Prussia and other German states into the wider German Confederation much like how the Holy Roman Empire did before it was dissolved by Napoleon despite efforts from European Statesmen to stabilize the post-napoleonic world much of Europe itself would succumb to a bout of nationalist fervor in 1848 various uprisings occurred all across Europe with many seeing the unification of German territories as inevitable nationalist politicians formed the Frankfurt Parliament and even offered the crown of Germany to King Frederick William IV of Prussia who rejected it in disgust for the conservative hoen zolern this title was a crown from the gutter a dog collar offered by Bakers and butchers and reeking with the stench of Revolution this sentiment was echoed by the aristocratic juncker class who berated the Democratic liberals for their attempts to erode the monarchy the question of United Germany gave rise to disagreements the Lesser Germany parties led by Prussia advocated for a smaller Germany that would exclude Austria on the other hand the greater Germany Advocates called for the inclusion of Austria aiming for a larger Empire that encompassed all german-speaking territories during these proceedings the great Statesman Otto von Bismarck emphasized the need for decisive action over liberal speeches and majority decisions for Bismarck the unification of Germany had to be achieved under the leadership of conservative and militaristic junkers in 1864 a conflict arose when Denmark claimed sovereignty over both schlesvik and Holstein causing Prussia and Austria to declare war and ultimately emerge Victorious as a result Prussia gained control of schlesvik while Austria acquired Holstein however tensions mounted as Austrian access to Holstein was throttled by Prussian bureaucracy leading to further conflicts in 1866 Prussian troops occupied Holstein sparking a war with Austria and the majority of the German Confederation who backed them the Italians also seeking to unify their own Peninsula joined the conflict by declaring war on Austria just five days later within a mere two months Prussia achieved a resounding victory over Austria annexing significant portions of Northern German territory and establishing the north German Confederation with the Iron Chancellor at the helm German expansion was all but inevitable an opportunity for such expansion presented itself in 1870 when the Spanish Crown was offered to a Hoenn solern while the hohen zolerance prince's candidacy was eventually withdrawn Bismarck released the M's dispatch a telegram sent by Wilhelm the first rejecting French demands that Prussia never again support a Hoenn solern candidacy this telegram made it appear as if the Prussian King Wilhelm the first had treated the French Envoy vasol Benedetti with much disrespect the French Emperor along with his people took it hook line and sinker expressing outrage at the incident which ultimately led to France declaring war on the prussians in response the Germans marched in and thoroughly trounced the French much to the humiliation of their adversary following their Victory the Germans unified into a new Empire and with it against the advice of Bismarck who feared French revanchism annexed ausas Lorraine in 1871. from here the new German State expanded its borders having brokered new territories in Africa during the Berlin Conference of 1884. Pacific colonies were purchased from Spain following the Spanish-American War while the North Sea Enclave of helicoland was ceded to Germany from the Brits within Asia the Germans were also able to gain a foothold in China following the Boxer Rebellion in the late 1890s by the turn of the 20th century Germany had arguably reached its zenith events following the first world war would see the German Empire dissolved and with it a score of territories including ausas Lorraine the Polish Corridor and schlesvik Beyond its European Holdings Germany was forced to cede all of its Colonial possessions which included German East Africa and Southwest Africa along with Pacific colonies such as nauru Western Samoa and Papua New Guinea in the place of the Empire an unstable Weimar Republic was left to pick up the pieces not lasting long before the rise of national socialism under Adolf Hitler the iridentist Nazis quickly sought to restore what they felt had been stolen reintegrating these are land from the League of Nations after a successful plebiscite in 1935. following their rapid re-militarization German troops marched into Austria and the Sudan land in 1938 annexing them into their vision of a greater Germany by March 1939 all of Czech had been absorbed into the Third Reich with Slovakia forming a puppet regime Poland's refusal to hand over the free city of Danzig in September then sparked the second world war plunging Germany into a Titanic conflict that eventually ended with them having less territory than when they started Germany lost a quarter of its pre-war territory to Poland and the Soviet Union with the remaining territory being divided into four occupation zones the British French Americans and Soviets each controlled a quadrant Berlin was also divided between the east and west Eastern Prussia and koenigsberg became kaliningrad part of the USSR to counter the Communist influence in the Cold War the Allied zones United to form the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 while the Soviet Union established the German Democratic Republic France maintained control over the Tsar land until another plebiscite in 1957 led to its reunification with Germany German borders would remain the same until 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell which led to the two germanies uniting in 1990 forming the modern German federal republic from the patchwork remnants of the Middle Ages through the Imperial Ambitions of the Hoenn solerns Germany slowly but surely converged into the nation-state that we see today while politics and diplomacy had their influence the concessions of War had as much to do with Germany's gains as it did with its losses the Iron Chancellor himself said it best when faced with the question of German unification not through speeches and majority decisions will the great questions of the day be decided but by Iron and blood\",\n",

the Forgotten storm That Shook the foundations of the East the sino-indian war of 1962. as many post-colonial border disputes normally do this one begins with the British the British and China's Qing Dynasty had disagreements about where exactly both of their dominions ended given that the Border was located on the incredibly hard to access Himalayan range it was hard to come to an agreement the disagreement was compounded by the fact that it was Tibet and not China proper which bordered British India and Tibet while de facto independent was a Chinese vassal the British would impose their border the ardag Johnson line on the Tibetans without negotiating with the Ching nonetheless the Ching accepted the borders for several decades things remained the same until the late 1800s when the great game between Russia and Britain was added to climax to prevent their Empires from stepping on each other's toes the British decided to draw a new line the McCartney McDonald line which would put the region of aksai chin under Qing rule the British would present the offer to pay King but the Qing never responded to it in the East decades later things would develop similarly with the British imposing yet another line the Mac Man line on the Tibetans once again the Chinese were not invited this deadlock would remain until India's independence the Indians would inherit their colonizers disputes with the independence of Pakistan further complicating things still while Pakistan and India never enjoyed good relations with each other the same could not be said for India and China India's prime minister and a major proponent of the cold Wars non-aligned movement wanted good relations with China hoping to establish an Asian axis to act as a counterbalance to the Soviet and American blocks in the west the Indians recognized the Johnson line as the Border as opposed to the Chinese who recognized the McDonald line furthermore in the East the Chinese rejected the McMahon line claiming most of the Indian state of arunachal Pradesh the Chinese took the position that the Tibetan government should not have been allowed to make such a treaty rejecting tibet's claims of independent rule things would deteriorate rapidly after the Chinese annexed Tibet eliminating the pseudo-buffer state between the two goliaths in 1956 to 1957 China constructed a road through aksai Chen connecting xinjiang and Tibet that ran south of the Johnson line in many places the Indians did not learn of this until the road was already completed and nehru was enraged while China was posturing abroad things were not as stable within Tibetan guerrillas continued to fight their Rule and soon they garnered support from the CIA this movement eventually ended in a massive Uprising in 1959 which the Chinese violently put down but the Dalai Lama managed to escape being offered asylum in India this offer of Asylum led to a series of violent border skirmishes between India and China but both Nations kept proposing diplomatic settlements from 1960 to 1962. although to no avail in response the Indians established the forward policy establishing Advanced posts in disputed areas the Indians also began requesting military aid from the West to counter the Chinese the request was denied as the U.S thought that the Indians were too soft on communism ironically enough this led the Indians to ask the Soviets for military aid who having recently fallen out with the Chinese agreed Studies have shown that a good night's rest improves mood memory engagement and performance important

and resumed previously banned forward patrols after April 30th 1962. Chairman Mao Zedong commented nehru wants to move forward and we won't let him originally we tried to guard against this but now it seems we cannot prevent it if he wants to advance we might as well adopt armed coexistence you wave a gun and I'll wave a gun wolf stand face to face and can each practice our courage various border conflicts between India and China flared up throughout the Summer and Autumn of 1962. in June a skirmish caused the death of a dozen Chinese troops on July 22nd the Ford policy was extended to allow Indian troops to push back Chinese troops already established in the disputed territory commanders were now given the discretion to open fire upon Chinese forces if threatened nonetheless the Indians were confident that a war would not be triggered and made little preparations India had only two divisions of troops in the region of the conflict even in September 1962 when Indian troops were ordered to expel the Chinese from thoglo Ridge Major General j s Dylan expressed that a few rounds fired at the Chinese would cause them to run away as a result when around a thousand Chinese surrounded a patrol of 50 Indians at yum Sola on October 10th the Indians were in no position to respond the patrol surprisingly managed to defeat the first Chinese Assault but were eventually defeated both sides suffered dozens of casualties but things could have been worse as the Chinese held their fire while Indians retreated and even buried the Indian Dead with military honors the attack was the heaviest fighting to this point and made it clear that the Chinese were preparing for an offensive but six days later the Cuban Missile Crisis kicked off and garnered the world's attention shielded by a distraction that would likely keep both the U.S and Soviet Union at Bay the Chinese decided to attack and on October 20th 1962 thousands of Chinese troops attacked Indian positions in both the East and Western borders in the East the people's Liberation Army sought to capture both Banks of namkachu River Indian forces were undermanned and ill-equipped with only an under strength Battalion to support them while the Chinese troops had three regiments positioned on the north side of the river the Indians expected Chinese forces to cross via one of five bridges over the river and defended those Crossings the pla bypassed The Defenders by fording the river which was shallow at that time of year instead the Chinese launched a surprise attack and overwhelmed the Indian troops which prompted their withdrawal from namkachu fearful of continued losses Indian troops retreated into Bhutan and the Chinese respected the border and did not pursue after four days of fierce fighting the Chinese succeeded in securing a substantial portion of the disputed territory in the west forty thousand Chinese had crossed into aksai chin where only several thousand Indian troops were garrisoned the Communists already controlled most of the disputed territory and late on October 19th launched several attacks on Indian positions by October 22nd all posts north of chuchul had been cleared after realizing the magnitude of the attack the Indian Western command withdrew many of the isolated outposts to the southeast by October 24th China had a strong diplomatic position with the majority of Chinese forces having Advanced almost 10 miles south of the control line before the conflict Chinese Premier Joe and Lai ordered the troops to stop advancing and attempted to negotiate with nehru as Indian forces retreated into more heavily fortified positions Joe's offer was that both sides would disengage and withdraw 12 miles from their current position that China and India not cross lines of present control in aksai chin and that China also Retreat north of the McMahon line in the east nehru replied three days later expressing interest in negotiation but was concerned about the mutual 12-mile withdrawal after China had Advanced dozens of miles in military aggression negotiations stalled once more and the Indian Parliament announced a National Emergency to kick the Invaders out a response that the United States and United Kingdom both supported as they began shipping military aid to India fighting resumed on November 14th with an Indian attack on wow long that inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese but did not manage to dislodge them in the west the Chinese launched an attack on the 18th of November near trucial this attack alongside another one in gurang Hill led to the Indians withdrawing from the area and also from the connecting spangor Gap having reached its claim lines the pla did not Advance further and on the 19th of November it declared a unilateral ceasefire the Chinese went with the offer nehru had rejected retreating to the actual control line and returning most of arunachal Pradesh they also only kept a third of what they had taken in aksai chin focusing on just keeping enough to protect the road they built from xinjiang to Tibet the ceasefire came just after the Indians had asked for American air support and soon after the U.S aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk was ordered back and American intervention avoided neither side declared war used their Air Force or fully broke off diplomatic relations but the conflict is still commonly referred to as a war while not necessarily a large one with only a couple thousand casualties on both sides it did have serious repercussions the loss pushed India to modernize its Army and be begin developing nuclear weapons the war also alienated Pakistan which while had traditionally been a U.S Ally saw the American Aid to India as a betrayal the end of the sino-indian war marked the end of India's forward policy and the de facto borders stabilized along the line of actual control where they remain to this day\",\n",
       " \" [Music] the end of the American Civil War marked a turning point in the history of the United States while the north emerged Victorious The South was left in Ruins and its people deeply divided for former Confederate soldiers the defeat meant grappling with a new reality their way of life and their cause were lost some chose to adapt to the new circumstances While others clung to the past or even left the country I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian and in today's video we'll discover what happened to Confederates after the American Civil War despite four years of brutal Bloodshed the end of the American Civil War was not a time of Vengeance and Punishment with Union troops lording over and abusing the erstwhile Rebels President Abraham Lincoln ordered that surrendering Confederates be offered the most liberal and honorable terms and order the Union's overall commander and future president General Ulysses S Grant followed when his Confederate counterpart General Robert E Lee formally surrendered at Appomattox on April 9 1865 Grant permitted all soldiers in Lee's army to keep their personal effects and horses when the Confederates formally handed over their battle flags and weaponry three days later Union Officers were ordered to show the utmost military respect including saluting as both officers and rank and files surrendered their arms and standards though other Confederate armies and formations would surrender in the upcoming months these ceremonies at Appomattox Mark the accepted end of the American Civil War the war had left the Southern United States devastated as scorched Earth campaigns by generals like William Tecumseh Sherman gutted infrastructure and the abolition of slavery collapsed its plantation-based economy the federal government was left debating how best to bring the rebels back into the fold with President Lincoln Desiring quick and amicable reintegration Lincoln proposed a general amnesty for any who had taken up the Confederate cause and that southern states be readmitted under the political control of these Southern whites once 10 percent of a given State's voters had sworn an oath of allegiance to the United States the state would be readmitted to the union and could re-establish its government and internal systems this plan was rejected outright by Radical Republicans a faction of Lincoln's party that sought to punish the South for slavery Insurrection or both radicals in Congress proposed their own plan requiring a full 50 of Southern voters to swear their loyalty to the union before their state could be readmitted a figure that could not be reached so close to the war and would have effectively prohibited the readmittance of Southern States but Lincoln capped to his hopes creating a legislative deadlock between him and The Radical Republicans a deadlock John Wilkes Booth broke at Ford's Theater the death of Lincoln marked a turn in the fortunes of the former Confederates as former slaveholder and Tennessean Andrew Johnson assumed the highest office in the land reconstruction the turbulent post-war period had begun Southern Devastation was economic and demographic 200 to 300 000 men died while wearing the Confederate gray a full quarter of the male population between 17 and 50. families were left without Fathers and Sons businesses without owners and workers and political offices vacant those men who survived the war returned to find their home States a smoking ruin with Union General Charles schurtz describing the site former Rebels returned to a broad black streak of Ruin and desolation the fences all gone Lonesome Smoke Stacks surrounded by dark heaps of ashes and Cinders marking spots where human habitation had stood the American Civil

for free using our Link in the description below this broad black streak teamed with destitute refugees masses of former slave owners average southern people and newly freed slaves left to contend with the physical and economic ruin a full two-thirds of the South's wealth had been consumed by the Civil War leaving what was once a hotbed of agrarian industry unable to even feed its population South Carolina the state where the war arguably started was forced to sell 300 000 or 5.5 million in today's dollars worth of bonds just to buy corn to feed its starving population the treasury Department did little to help these situation with treasury agents sweeping into the South to seize abandoned property including stocks of the South's last major resource cotton treasury agents decreed that this cotton was to be seized as War reparations but the men in charge of such dealings were far from honest a system emerged in which Southern cotton owners would avoid having their stocks seized by swearing that they had never been disloyal to the United States however these Arrangements often involved collusion between wealthy Southerners and treasury agents as a result a portion of the unseased cotton would be sold by the agents for personal profit although most returned to igaw a living in their ruined land not all were willing to abide by the South's new social order or risk persecution for their participation in the war a number of Confederate politicians fled to Europe such as Secretary of State Judah P Benjamin and Secretary of War John C Breckenridge who found shelter in Britain before dying in Paris and returning home on a pardon respectively Confederate President Jefferson Davis attempted a similar Escape but was captured by federal Cavalry Rank and file Confederates cast their eyes even further south with a number settling in Mexico these men reasoned that the United States would come to blows with Mexico again and they could once more March against the Yankees but Mexico was a nation without slavery an institution many ex-confederates still held close to their hearts and as luck would have it so did The Empire of Brazil sensing a New Economic Opportunity for his vast Nation Brazilian Emperor Dom Pedro II offered cheap farmland and Sanctuary to any Confederates who settled in Brazil intent on leveraging Southern expertise in farming cotton with local slave labor 20 000 Confederates took Pedro up on his offer establishing the town of Americana roughly 260 miles from the city of Sao Paulo the immigrants found Brazil to their liking with one transplant musing the war-worn soldier the bereaved parent the oppressed Patriot the homeless and despoiled can find Refuge from the trials which beset them and a home not haunted by the Eternal remembrance of harrowing scenes of sorrow and death the citizens of Americana continue to celebrate Confederate Memorial days and exhibit reverence for 19th century Southern Culture even as Brazil abolished slavery in 1888 and many prominent Rebels Jefferson Davis and Robert E Lee among them condemned the Americana project in their lifetimes it was these same prominent Rebels that found themselves squarely in President Johnson's sights while a general amnesty was declared for Rank and file Confederates an exception was made for those with property worth more than twenty thousand dollars or three hundred and seventy thousand dollars in modern times this placed wealthy Planters and Confederate leadership in the position of having to specifically and publicly apply for clemency supplicating themselves before Washington other exceptions included Confederate president Davis who was kept manacled under strict guard while the U.S decided what to charge him with the conditions of his imprisonment made Davis a martyr to Southerners and earned him sympathy from the Yankee public though Davis would never be tried for any crimes against the United States other high-ranking Confederates would be indicted for treason and one Confederate officer Henry Wertz was executed for war crimes in wurz's case for the deplorable and deadly conditions of the Andersonville prison yet even as his government made these shows a force Johnson followed many of Lincoln's ideas for reconstruction to the point of being more lenient in readmitting States Johnson declared that North Carolina could reapply for admission when its citizens had written a new state constitution and formed a government loyal to the United States eliminating the requirements for Oaths of Allegiance this set a precedent and the unrestored States rushed to meet these terms themselves in hopes of rejoining the Union without Federal interference and many former Confederate luminaries would use their State's readmission as a ticket back to political power all in all the former Vice President of the Confederacy four Confederate generals five Confederate Colonels six Confederate cabinet officers and 58 Confederate congressmen went to Washington thanks to the 1865 election across the South candidates for official positions often had late of the Confederacy printed on their tickets to solicit support for their election some of those elected proudly wore their uniforms to their State's legislative sessions however Southerners would join the government to promote unity and reconstruction such as noted confederate general James Longstreet Longstreet was initially indicted for treason but his case was dismissed at the insistence of Union general grant writing in a New Orleans paper regarding reconstruction he stated that the war was made upon Republican issues and it seems to me fair and just that the settlement should be made accordingly Longstreet would go on to join the Republican party promoting reconstruction and criticizing his former Commander Robert E Lee at any opportunity his position on reconstruction was deemed treacherous by most Southerners white Southerners regardless of their feelings on reconstruction could not tolerate the sight of their land being occupied by federal troops many of whom were black they bristled at this seeing the federals as Invaders and the presence of black soldiers as a calculated insult in reality the quick establishment of state governments under Johnson's presidency meant actual troop numbers in the South were small and they dwindled rapidly with each year of reconstruction but racism was not limited to being insulted at the presence of black troops slavery may have legally been over but the South sought to maintain white supremacy in every facet of Life while Southerners fear for their position was existential reconstruction meant voting rights for black people a prospect the former Confederates saw as little more than a ploy to create one-party Republican rule as states were reorganized legislators pushed to pass us Black Codes that granted black citizens basic rights on paper but in reality placed so many restrictions and caveats on them that black Southerners were reduced to near slave status black citizens were compelled to enter into paid labor contracts that put them into indentured servitude to whoever employed them with individuals empowered to arrest and return any black employee who left their job before their contract expired the federal government saw these acts as an attempt to revive slavery in all but name something unacceptable to the republican-controlled Congress in order to Stave off attempts at reintroducing slavery in a new guise the federal government had created the Freedmen's Bureau while this agency was set up shortly prior to the end of the war to assist refugees and displaced persons of all Races it was intended to assist recently freed slaves in particular the bureau set up schools and hospitals mediated labor negotiations but between businesses and emancipated workers and held confiscated land to be parceled out as 40 acres and a mule President Johnson however pressured the bureau to return confiscated lands to their original Confederate owners with freedmen receiving little land of their own the bureau was more successful in establishing schools and hospitals treating hundreds of thousands of patients and educating many first-generation students however these acts ran contrary to former Confederate values Anthony recently reconstituted state governments made it clear that the bureau had no real Authority in their borders former Confederates saw the bureau as virtually a foreign government forced upon them and supported by an army of occupation While others declared it an enemy of Southern sovereignty President Johnson soon came out as an enemy of the Freedmen's Bureau in 1866 vetoing an extension to its funding and essentially shutting the organization down former Confederates soon began enforcing the Black Codes through ad hoc violence with some of these Bandit gangs growing so powerful that federal troops had to meet them in pitched battle these protective societies enjoyed immense public support to the point that one such Collective the Ku Klux Klan became a national Scourge with the election of former Confederate Raider Nathan Bedford Forrest as its supreme leader the KKK determined that the ad hoc attacks were not enough Southern blacks had to be reminded of their place through Terror an epidemic of violence erupted with lynchings of black people and white Northerners voter intimidation and public displays of grim pageantry used to deliver a simple message we the white Southerners are still in charge and it will stay that way although the federal government passed laws targeting the KKK and sent troops into southern states to root them out former Confederate soldiers had succeeded in their goals of regaining political power and re-establishing the social mores of the Old South with the end of reconstruction and the withdrawal of federal troops they were able to rebuild their communities and institutions nearly as they had been before the war the impact of their efforts continued to Mark American social and political disputes to this day\",\n",
       " \" when the Russian army invaded Ukraine in late February of 2022 many assumed that the young nation's days were numbered yet over a year later the Ukrainian military still seems far from defeated and the outcome of the conflict still hangs in the balance I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian and today we're taking a closer look at the making of the modern Ukrainian military the fighting force that has surprised both friend and foe alike as the Soviet Union buckled under its own weight in 1991 Ukraine emerged as one of several newly independent nations from Eastern Europe with collapse came inheritance as Keith suddenly found itself in possession of a large chunk of the former Soviet military this Force included various armies approximately 6 500 tanks over 7 000 armored vehicles a significant Air Force of around 1500 combat aircraft and a naval presence in the form of over 95 vessels of all sizes with 780 000 Personnel the Armed Forces of Ukraine were among the largest militaries on the continent however sustaining a fighting force of that size would prove highly costly and impractical at a time where a major European conflict seemed out of the question as such the Ukrainian government opted to significantly reduce the size of its military over one hundred thousand soldiers were discharged in the wake of budget cuts part of the funds freed up from these reforms were instead diverted to the development of a national arms industry making a profit off of weapons of war was deemed more lucrative than sustaining an unnecessarily large fighting force competitively priced Ukrainian manufactured tanks apcs and aircraft soon made their way onto the international market by 2003 the military reforms were officially completed the size of the Armed Forces had shrunk to about 295 000 Personnel in 2010 this number would further be reduced to around two hundred thousand and would subsequently drop as low as 130 000 when conscription was ended in October of 2013. on the geopolitical front the new government in Kiev was among the first of former Soviet Bloc Nations to begin fostering closer relations with the NATO military Alliance in 1995 NATO aided Ukraine during the kharkiv drinking water disaster and two years later the NATO Ukraine commission was established by 2004 relations had progressed to the point that Keef approved policies aimed toward deepening its ties with NATO through political and economic reforms establishing a commission for cooperation with the alliance and opening the door to joint military exercises president Victor ushenko who led the country from 2005 to 2010 became the face of pro-western alignment and made it his official policy to push Ukraine towards total independence from Russia while actively seeking to have his country join NATO during the 2008 Bucharest Summit NATO declared Ukraine's permission for NATO membership welcoming them to join whenever they wanted so long as they met the criteria for accession outlined in article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty given Ukraine's tender position the requirements were considerable Not only would Ukraine have to secure political and public support for NATO they would also have to commit national resources to defense spending Regional cooperation and arms compatibility with other NATO members this latter requirement would be especially difficult given that the majority of Ukraine's military stockpile was Soviet Surplus while yushenko pushed on the government remained traditionally divided on the issue of joining NATO due to its economic dependence with Russia militarily Kiev maintained close relations with Russia until the Fateful events of 2014. after russian-backed separatist forces in the donbass region rose up in rebellion and Russian troops moved to Annex the Crimean Peninsula the Ukrainian military began a period of expansion that has continued up to the present day although the fighting up to 2022 was contained to the two separatist regions and officially only involved Ukrainian and separatist forces moscow's influence in the area was overt and the government in Kiev continued to fear an eventual full-scale Russian invasion investments into the depleted Armed Forces grew exponentially and by July 2022 close to half a year after the Russian invasion then Ukrainian defense minister Alexander resnikov stated that the Armed Forces now number over 700 000 Personnel amounting to two armored and 13 mechanized brigades two Mountain brigades Seven rocket and artillery brigades as well as 225 aircraft to sustain and further develop this fighting force Ukraine's defense budget has skyrocketed to 8.3 billion dollars in 2022 a number which is projected to increase even further this year these spectacular increase in defense spending has resulted in a similarly impressive influx of new weaponry and Equipment of all types however with fighting in the country ongoing it is difficult to accurately determine the quantities of operational equipment in use equipment and vehicle types that have made their way to the front are in constant flux due to the haphazard arrival of armaments deliveries from pro-western and NATO countries ranging from a wide variety of small arms to several artillery systems and even tanks before we continue I'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video raycon when I'm not using my

historian to get 15 off of your raycon purchase before the large-scale arrival of Western Equipment the standard gear of the Ukrainian Army mostly consisted of a selection of weapons from its own arms industry besides its stockpile of AK type assault rifles and light machine guns from the Soviet era the Ukrainian Army has relied on the tar-21 or Fort 221 Bullpup assault rifle as its service weapon of choice although initially only utilized by Special Forces and the Ukrainian Security Service the rifle has since made its way to regular divisions as well to bolster its long range capabilities Ukrainian infantry have relied on the VPR 308 sniper rifle which with its light frame and increased effective range has been an upgrade from the older and much more cumbersome Soviet SVD rifle in terms of explosive Firepower Ukrainian soldiers are equipped with the homemade uag-40 automatic grenade launcher its high level of portability and ease of use make it a desirable weapon in both open ground and urban settings finally for its anti-tank capabilities Ukrainian ground units use the stugna P anti-tank missile system fired from t-55 tanks and the mt-12 field gun the stugna's laser-guided system can hit moving targets with a range of up to 5 kilometers and penetrate armor with up to 800 millimeters in thickness the Ukrainian military command has also invested much into the Army's artillery capabilities including artillery locating Radars battery command and control systems to enhance the efficiency of its artillery core Ukrainian command has put special emphasis on the training and formation of new drone forward observation and fire coordination units the Turkish made by Rockstar tb2 armed drone has become such a crucial component of the Ukrainian armed forces that their plans underway to establish local production of these drones in the vicinity of Kiev in addition to ukrainian-made Weaponry the Armed Forces continue to be amply supplied with both American-made Javelin anti-tank missile systems as well as british-made and law rocket launchers the American Security assistance program alone has amounted to 2.7 billion dollars worth of weapons and equipment between 2014 and early 2022. the Ukrainian Air Force for its part has given priority to upgrading the nation's large existing air defense network with its wide array of soviet-era air defense systems the Navy similarly has primarily focused on purchasing small-sized vessels in accordance with its aptly named mosquito Doctrine which envisions rapid hit-and-run attacks against the larger Russian Navy with agile Patrol boats equipped with guided missiles as well as unmanned Kamikaze drones the nature of service and conscription within the military has also undergone many changes under the Soviet Union all able-bodied males were required to serve two years in the armed forces or three years in the Navy mandatory conscription was stopped briefly in October 2013 with the armed forces being made up of 40 conscripts and 60 contract soldiers however less than one year later acting President Alexander turchinoff reinstated conscription in May of 2014 with a modified Target of males between the ages of 20 to 27 over the previous 18 to 25. in 2017 over 14 000 individuals enlisted in the Ukrainian Armed Forces for contract Service however draft evasion had been an ongoing issue since its re-implementation in 2014. by 2022 President Vladimir zielenski announced the end of conscription by January 1st 2024 along with an increase in professional servicemen and improved compensation and housing however the Russian invasion disrupted these plans and popular mobilization occurred including the recruitment of prisoners with combat experience after the start of the war in the donbass region in 2014 Keef set to identify key weak points within its armed forces the review found that rampant corruption poor Logistics and Medical Care inefficient command and overall inability to combat cyber attacks all contributed to poor combat performance on the battlefield to remedy these shortcomings then president Petro proshenko directed sweeping reforms in all these areas amongst these changes was a vital initiative to radically change the culture surrounding lower level command structure which had previously insisted that lower level leaders wait for approval from higher headquarters for every desired move now the idea was that leaders on the ground would be encouraged to take initiative wherever applicable due to fears of a looming Russian invasion poroshenko's reforms were given absolute priority and set to be completed in just four years by the time the Russian forces moved into Ukraine's territory in 2022 the Ukrainian armed forces would prove a far more formidable foe than the one Russian troops had met eight years prior on February 24 2022 Ukraine's worst fears were confirmed as Russian forces crossed into Ukraine across multiple fronts targeting key centers such as Odessa kharkif and Kiev however Russia's plan for a swift Victory had been thwarted as the newly reformed Ukrainian armed forces were able to withstand the initial Invasion despite their tenuous position the defense of Ukraine's Capital Kiev was vital in denying Russia one of their most important strategic objectives while the displays of tenacity such as that in Mario poll showed the extremes to which many Ukrainian volunteers were willing to go since 2014 a key component of the Ukrainian defensive strategy has been the construction of trench lines which have helped consolidate and hold territory under their control since 2022 this strategy has remained with major trench lines becoming key factors toward the static war that has since developed ever since the Russian Advance began to slow down even as recently as the Battle of bakmut Ukrainian soldiers are hunkered down waiting for the attrition of their enemies to blunt any further offensives that may occur later down the line within a span of just 30 years the Ukrainian military has transformed itself from a bloated relic of its Soviet past into a modern fighting force seemingly capable of going toe-to-toe against one of these strongest militaries in the world its rekindling of ties to Nato and the West has arguably contributed much to this process over the years but unlike several other western-backed militaries around the world the Ukrainian armed forces have thus far surpassed all expectations and have managed to hold their own in what they believe to be a fight for their country his very existence\",\n",
       " \" [Music] the dawn of September 11 2001 signaled a Monumental shift in modern geopolitics when Al-Qaeda an extensive Global extremist Network carried out a devastating attack on the United States as a consequence the U.S initiated a comprehensive effort to disassemble the organization and motivate the replacement of the supporting Taliban regime who sheltered Al Qaeda in the war-torn region of Afghanistan I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian and today we will be delving into the American intervention in Afghanistan following the attacks on it was immediately clear to the United States who was behind it Osama Bin Laden founder and leading figurehead of al-Qaeda for President George W bush and his National Security advisors their immediate response was to open up channels to Bin Laden's Network in Afghanistan attempts were made by some U.S officials to arrange for the extradition of Bin Laden without resorting to war the most notable among these was Robert Grenier then CIA Chief in Pakistan on September 15th Grenier met with a Taliban Commander called akhtar Muhammad azmani and asked for his help in turning over Bin Laden to the Americans Osmani was convinced to ask the Taliban leader Muhammad Omar mujahid to surrender Bin Laden in order to avoid an American Invasion however as Grenier began opening this channel through to the Taliban President Bush issued an ultimatum in a speech before Congress on September 20th he called for the Taliban to surrender Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda or share their fate a bold demand but one empowered by Congress who had given Bush authority to use all necessary and appropriate Force against those behind the September 11th attacks this also included any supporters of the perpetrators Mala Omar refused Bush's ultimatum claiming Bin Laden had not committed the attacks as further justification Omar cited Bin Laden's oath of allegiance to him and the Afghan people's honorable commitment to protect their guests by this time it became clear that the Taliban were no longer willing to hand over Bin Laden and grenier's last proposals for negotiations were dismissed and his channels to Osmani dried up in order to tackle the war against al Qaeda and its Taliban supporters the Bush Administration developed six strategic objectives for the operations in Afghanistan with the key Focus being the elimination of al-Qaeda and the possible capture of Osama bin Laden the objectives would be incorporated into the wider operation enduring Freedom which was all but confirmed following the deadline

which in turn rallied the Taliban to Mala Omar and Bin Laden in order to avoid the worst of these strikes Bin Laden left his home in Kandahar and disappeared and had his top commanders sent out of the country Al-Qaeda was virtually dismantled except for loyal fighters who remained on the front lines outside Kabul While others retreated East into the mountains to await the U.S attack in the meantime other divisions within the CIA were busy enacting plans parallel to Robert grenier's overtures back in September under the cia's special activities division a paramilitary team led by senior intelligence Officer Gary schron flew to Tashkent Uzbekistan on September 20th aboard a CIA cargo plane six days later they boarded an old russian-made mi-17 helicopter and were inserted into the panchier valley north of Kabul they flew in with weapons secure satellite Communications gear GPS mapping equipment and 10 million dollars in boxed cash the sad operatives were welcomed by the Northern Alliance who were already engaged in their Insurgency against the Taliban led by Muhammad Fahim shron's agents went to work establishing the first of more than a dozen Ford operating bases across Afghanistan the sad worked alongside Afghan Warlords and rebel armies to send human intelligence back to Langley this included important data such as the locations of minefields and terrorist safe houses with the stroke of a computer key counter-terrorism center staff in America could keep a record of these locations and relay them to CIA paramilitary operators to assist them with field work operations were being driven 24 7 from inside the cia's Global Response Center which secured a direct line to the defense Department's joint intelligence operations center at Central Command in Florida the cia's paramilitary teams would be augmented with Special Operations forces from the military such as the Green Berets and Delta Force despite the evacuation of Bin Laden and his senior officers from Afghanistan the U.S military exhausted its list of fixed Taliban Targets in the first two nights of bombing in which more than 100 Afghans were reported killed by October 19th Special Forces had arrived with three 12-man teams initially deployed to the areas of takar panchier and Mazar e Sharif Moore arrived within the month the Northern Alliance had 15 to 20 000 men split between four commanders across five different locations the Kabul front line badakshan takar Central Afghanistan and harat throughout Afghanistan the Taliban had around 45 000 men plus 2700 Al Qaeda and other foreign Fighters the Taliban fighting forces were arrayed across the north organized as fronts consisting of Fighters under various commanders these fronts faced the Northern Alliance forces near Kabul adakshan and Mazar e Sharif once the air campaign began other cadres from the south and east were sent to reinforce their front line in Kabul additionally volunteers rushed in from Pakistan perhaps as many as 500 per day under the American Central Command in Afghanistan General Tommy Franks launched a ground offensive after October 19th shifting air assets to support the Northern Alliance in combat with this new close air support the CIA and Special Forces teams were working directly alongside Northern Alliance commanders from October 21st they began their attack on the Taliban front lines south of Missouri Sharif eventually leading to its capture on November 12th much of the success with the Northern Alliance and U.S Special Forces lay in their maneuverability making extensive use of horses to sweep across the difficult Afghan Terrain in a scene somewhat reminiscent of a historical epic Chief Warrant Officer Bob Pennington recalled their great ride toward Missouri Sharif I looked back looked South and then I just realized it was the most unbelievable shot I've ever seen it was a thousand Riders on Horseback it was peaceful yet magnificent victories by the Coalition and its allies had spread panic throughout Taliban forces in the capital of Kabul who began leaving the city in troves by November 13th the taliban's presence in Kabul had completely collapsed with words spreading South and undermining Taliban morale everywhere Taliban fighters outside of the city in the Eastern and Southern regions started laying down arms blending into their Villages heading to Pakistan or making for the mountains the sovereignty of their religious State crumbled leaving Authority up to localized tribal leaders after the fall of Kabul the issue of establishing a new government to replace the Taliban became a pressing concern instead of a formal Administration Warlords took control of the areas they had liberated causing problems in governance the U.N was pleased with the Allied Victory but dismayed at the lack of progress in forming a new government the Northern Alliance especially was reluctant to expand into the Pashto regions of jalalabad or Kandahar which led to the United States supporting local Pashto allies Hamid Karzai a skilled Diplomat and tribal leader was chosen to lead the new interim government to help solidify this progress the United States Pakistan India Russia and Iran worked together at the bond conference to establish a political settlement and to transition Afghanistan toward democracy this resulted in the bond agreement which outlined a series of steps toward establishing democracy including the formation of an interim Administration a grand assembly to choose a transitional government and national elections Karzai was elected leader of this new interim government and with U.S Special Forces protection moved out of Southern Afghanistan pressing onto Kandahar City even after an accidental U.S bombing had injured him and killed 10 members of his retinue along with three Special Forces Troopers assigned to him despite the victories throughout Afghanistan the hunt for Osama Bin Laden and other Al-Qaeda leaders was still ongoing in early December teams working under the CIA and task force sword had infiltrated the mountainous area of torabora confirming the presence of both Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters on December 5th task 4 sword and Northern Alliance militias Advanced on tour of Aura with U.S air support pushing deep into the mountain bunkers and caves additional Afghan Fighters with aged soviet-made tanks joined the operation as did German and British special forces units despite the heavy bombing and capture of jihadist Fighters Bin Laden was not found the operation ended in mid-December with estimates asserting that 1500 to 2000 Afghan Arab and Chechen Al-Qaeda Fighters occupied torabora before the attack of these perhaps two-thirds evacuated across the border into Pakistan other Taliban and Al-Qaeda Fighters crossed the border elsewhere along its 1200 mile length but mola Omar the Taliban leader and Osama Bin Laden successfully fled to Pakistan the evacuation of jihadists from torabora left only a short moment of respite in early 2002 American intelligence picked up indications of al-Qaeda Fighters concentrating in the Shah I caught Valley in Afghanistan the terrain of Shah akat was challenging making it difficult to reach the valley by helicopters launched from Bagram the 10th Mountain division commanded by the United States Central Command in Kuwait was moved to Bagram Airfield and became the main conventional land force in the country and was bolstered by troops of the 101st Airborne Division this was then designated cjtf Mountain led by U.S Army Major General Franklin hagenbach operation Anaconda was launched in March 2002 to deal with the al-Qaeda presence but soon ran into unexpected difficulties the Afghan militia led by U.S Special Operations forces were delayed by a traffic accident and then mistakenly attacked by an AC-130 Gunship U.S infantry were also subject to effective enemy fire from well-prepared fighting positions that were difficult to locate and air support proved more difficult to coordinate than anticipated lacking organic artillery large numbers of airstrikes and sorties by Attack Helicopters were needed to keep the American troops alive this unexpectedly heavy opposition caused the U.S infantry to withdraw from its exposed positions on March 4th U.S Special Operations forces attempted to establish observation posts to overlook the enemy in the process a U.S Navy SEAL was captured and killed by the enemy six more U.S troops were killed and a helicopter was shot down during the ensuing fighting this part of the battle became known as the Battle of Robert's Ridge and it took five more days for the ground forces to achieve control over the key Terrain many of the al-Qaeda and jihadist Defenders had been killed by intense American airstrikes yet U.S troops were astonished to find well-protected trenches bunkers and observation posts and supplies left intact none of these positions had been detected by drones air reconnaissance or satellites according to the United States Army reports the operations suffered from inadequate intelligence insufficient organic fire support and unrealistic expectations including an over-reliance on Warlord militias a major weakness was AirLand integration due to a mutual lack of understanding between the cjtf mountain headquarters at Bagram air base and the U.S air headquarters in Qatar despite this the Coalition did achieve Victory with Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters being forced to evacuate the valley while suffering heavy casualties with Al Qaeda booted out of Afghanistan and the Taliban government shattered into disparate cadres America had achieved a measure of Victory the establishment of the Afghan interim government also contributed towards the objectives laid out by the Bush Administration for Afghanistan yet all was not over for the Taliban they suffered a great loss but their struggle against the West had only just begun join us next time as we look into the prolonged occupation of Afghanistan as part of operation enduring freedom\",\n",

the inter-war period was fraught with the same anxieties felt by countries all over the world the Great Depression had effectively crippled the economy with the collapse of World Trade and ineffective countermeasures sparking criticism from those who opposed the liberal capitalist system this led to Rising influence within Japan's far right circles most importantly the military who by 1931 had instigated the mukden incident a false flag event that enabled Japan's quantong Army under General Shigeru Hangzhou to seize all of Manchuria establishing the puppet stay of manchukwo which provided resources for the home islands and acted as a bolt work against the Soviet Far East which loomed ominously on the northern border shot by the military's insubordination Japan's civilian government felt powerless to challenge the rapid victories gained from their Conquest which only empowered the military further by 1936 a series of assassinations and coup d'etat plots had been carried out by extremist elements known as the young officers their reign of terror helped embolden the influence of military staff within the Japanese cabinet and ultimately gained support for further military actions in China Japan's signing of the anti-common turn pact in November also secured the nation for their eventual conflict with the Soviet Union and notably The Pact changed Germany's Far East Asian policy which dropped support for China in favor of Japan while border skirmishes tested the medal of communist sovereignty in the north a new front was opened further south in July 1937 following the Marco Polo Bridge incident as ground forces from Japan's China Garrison Army poured into the Peking tiansin region of China this incursion would escalate full scale into the second sino-japanese war or in Japanese simply the China incident as Chinese cities were decimated and pillaged Japanese relations with the West worsened significantly the West broadly condemned the atrocities committed by the Japanese military on Chinese civilians in an occupation they had first deemed illegal since the invasion of Manchuria along with the rising embargoes from the West the Japanese Army also suffered a humiliating defeat at calcan goal in September 1939 when the invading Japanese sixth Army was defeated in a series of pitched Battles by the Soviet Red Army despite this loss Germany's invasion of Poland looked like an opportunity to establish a new order in East Asia for the Japanese a broadcast on June 29 1940 by foreign minister arita hachiro advocated for the inclusion of various South Seas areas later developing into the greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere as Germany conquered Europe Japan set about acquiring the territories necessary for their co-prosperity beyond their gains in China Japan Incorporated French Indochina with German consent on September 22nd 1940 occupying the former colonies until the Vichy French authorities bowed to the Japanese demands four days later the next day Japan signed The tripartite Pact concluding a defensive alliance with Germany and Italy against the United States who by this time had sought to Japan's war effort with harsh sanctions and embargoes on much-needed resources like Machine Tools aviation fuel and scrap metal the need for these resources coupled with fears of an eventual Oil Embargo drove Japan further toward establishing their co-prosperity sphere which was deemed vital for the ongoing War in China at home the Japanese public were galvanized into support of the Empire through intense repression and propaganda anti-subversion laws and controls over the Intelligentsia were implemented to discourage liberal Tendencies education on all levels was revoked to indoctrinate the youth shaping them as future assets for Japanese Supremacy over Asia and the Pacific Imperial propagandists Incorporated Shinto religious traditions in this effort forming a state-sanctioned cult which served the Empire's interest first and foremost above all this Hirohito reigned as the Divine figurehead Emperor showa it was under his name that Japanese Fighters dedicated their famous Banzai Battle Cry charging recklessly into the enemy with bayonets swords or in the cockpit of a diving aircraft militarily resources of the co-prosperity sphere would be secured under a national resource Zone which stretched from Burma to melanesia to protect this Zone the newly conquered territories would be defended by the Army while the Navy secured its ocean Lanes this daunting task of Naval superiority in the Pacific was made attainable thanks to Japan withdrawing from the Washington Naval limitation treaty in 1937 giving the Navy ample time to construct some of the largest battleships ever built like the Yamoto and the Musashi at the same time senior staff held doubts about these super battleships urging those in government to shift Focus toward air power and submarines needed for the National Defense Zone of those senior staff the most notable was its commander-in-chief Admiral isaroku Yamamoto who was a longtime believer in Naval Aviation something which played a key role in his plans for operation Z the attack on Pearl Harbor operation Z envisioned a preemptive strike on the U.S Pacific Fleet and her aircraft carriers taking advantage of a delayed American response to quickly invade and occupy all of the planned Southern resource zones with these natural resources secured and the Americans so suddenly brutalized it was believed that the Allies would leave Japan dominant over the Pacific however inter-service tensions brood over priorities of the war the Army remained adamant on the Chinese Theater and pushed to seize natural resources in the areas north of Manchuria the Navy instead advocated for the new South Sea areas and with the Army's loss of favor after calcane Gaul the Navy was given their opportunity want to keep up with community events and discussions check out our Discord server today on December 7th 1941 combined elements of Japan's first air fleet attacked without a declaration of war 350 aircraft attacked Pearl Harbor and military bases on Oahu with the U.S Navy losing four battleships 188 aircraft and 2400 Sailors over the next four hours the Japanese Navy only lost 29 aircraft and 55 Pilots soon after Japan invaded the Philippines Singapore and the rest of Southeast Asia with Little Resistance from the Allied Nations the surprise nature of these invasions succeeded thanks to the competence of Japanese commanders with examples like the Malay operation under General tomoyuki yamashta seeing the entire Peninsula captured by the 25th Army in a blitzkrieg assault that lasted only 70 days on the home front a mixture of excitement and anxiety lingered among the public no Lantern parades rang out like after the capture of Nan King instead the Japanese expressed resolve in the face of a waking Giant for Admiral Yamamoto there was a great concern for the U.S aircraft carriers which had avoided destruction at Pearl Harbor this fear proved to be well founded after the USS Hornet penetrated the Western Pacific without alerting Japanese patrols and successfully launched a carrier strike over Tokyo in what became known as the Doolittle Raid in response the Army launched operations Sego ravaging the jejung zhangji region in China in search of the American Airmen who had taken shelter there after the raid a month later the Port Moresby operation was foiled after a strategic withdrawal following the Battle of the Coral Sea which marked the first time Japan's Navy had been stopped in its tracks Yamamoto was well aware of America's potential for total retaliation and sought to turn the tide by establishing a new base of operations to renew their attacks on U.S bases in Hawaii for this the Admiral first wished to trap the U.S Navy's remaining Pacific Fleet carriers and battleships at Midway atoll then established bases in the Aleutian Islands to prevent the U.S from conducting strategic bombing raids across the Northern Pacific the resources required to capture the Illusions diverted assets away from the attack at Midway with the surprise element becoming undone by U.S intelligence who broke Japanese Naval codes and hatched their own plans in preparation for the confrontation over the fourth to the 7th of June the Battle of Midway saw Japan's four premier aircraft carriers and a Heavy Cruiser destroyed along with the loss of 248 aircraft and the deaths of 3057 personnel from his Flagship Admiral matone ugaki recorded the tables had turned entirely and we are now forced to do our utmost to cope with the worst case this should be kept in mind as a lesson showing that war is not predictable despite the defeat at Midway inter-service rivalries once again reared its ugly head as the Army was misled about the battle's aftermath due to this the Army continued to believe for a short while that the fleet was in good condition for the enemy however these recent victories had given them the confidence and momentum needed to begin their island-hopping campaign Japanese military leadership were aware that their forces were not adjusting quickly enough to fit the new demands of combat attempts to update their Arsenal in 1942 were unsuccessful as the majority of weapons remain unchanged due to a lack of resources the Army's Focus shifted to securing occupied territories and controlling a widely dispersed military with the rush to produce equipment there was little time for quality control integration of improvements or improved Packaging the Japanese faced many material shortages which forced them to prioritize production for aircraft and ships at the cost of other much-needed armaments but even this was not enough in late 1942 allied Landings in Guadalcanal left the Japanese isolated into pockets of resistance allowing the Allies to bypass them for bigger targets over 1943 the Japanese defense of the occupied Gilbert and Marshall Islands was marked by Fierce fighting on both land and sea with the Japanese suffering heavy losses due to the superior Firepower of the Allied Forces by 1944 the Japanese Navy had lost Naval superiority after a crushing defeat in June during the battle of the Philippine Sea characterized as the largest carrier to carrier battle in history the lack of Japanese fire support was detrimental to their defense of the Mariana and Palau islands where the Japanese suffered heavy losses because of the Americans Superior Firepower and the Strategic bombing campaigns while the North China area Army under General akamura yatsutsuga thundered across China amid operation Ichigo General yamashita's defense of the occupied Philippines was crippled by another Naval defeat at the Battle of Leyte golf where the first organized use of Kamikaze attacks did little to sway the tide Japan's fighting Spirit remained tenacious with the Americans forced to contend with displays like that of General yoshitsugu saitos 4 300 man Bonsai charge during the Battle of Saipan a ferocious assault which decimated the American 105th Infantry Regiment at the cost of nearly all of its attackers despite their losses both the Army and Navy made it clear that the Americans would have to fight both tooth and nail for every island occupied by Japanese forces the rising failures of late 1944 to 1945 highlighted the military's desperate situation island hopping campaigns ground away Japanese garrisons leaving many abandoned to an honorable death like that of General tadamishi kiribayashi at the Battle of Iwo Jima offensive campaigns such as operation Hugo petered out before they were even began due to the severe lack of resources 1945 marked the final Turning Point as March saw the U.S launch a firebombing campaign across Tokyo devastating the city's industrial capacity and leaving a death toll of 80 000 to nearly 100 000 people with the Allied Forces closing in Japan found itself using all means necessary to defend the home Islands during the U.S invasion of Okinawa in June over 100 000 troops were stationed to defend the island inflicting some of the heaviest American casualties of the entire War which also came at a huge cost to the Japanese and Okinawan conscripts some estimates claim that up to half of the Island's population was killed forced to commit suicide or otherwise disappeared during the battle meanwhile Japan's second fleet was thrown at the Allies in a suicidal attack known as operation Tango which promptly failed after having their Naval codes once again decrypted by U.S intelligence despite a barrage of Kamikaze attacks the U.S fifth Fleet had sunk the Yamoto and five of the other nine ships present at the battle the writing was on the wall Allied Forces called for the unconditional surrender of Japan at the Potsdam Conference on the 26th of July 1945 threatening refusal with prompt and utter disruption Japan's government ignored the Allies ultimatum leading to the decision by the United States with agreement from the United Kingdom to use the newly created atomic bombs against them the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki occurred on the 6th and 9th of August 1945 respectively leaving a collective death toll estimated to have killed hundreds of thousands both from the immediate detonation and radiation poisoning in the weeks and months after following the bombing of Hiroshima the Soviet Union declared war driving into Manchuria after the bombing of Nagasaki still Japan seemed poised to wager the lives of all of its people in the name of Empire only on August 15th after the unfamiliar voice of the emperor called out for peace did the

punishment that many Germans felt for their role in the Nazi regime high-profile fugitives in particular stood little chance to remain hidden in Europe as country is banded together to hunt down surviving war criminals many South American nations however had a history of welcoming German immigrants and held few grudges against them the authoritarian regimes ruling over some of these nations were sympathetic to Nazi ideology and were more than willing to provide Refuge to former Nazi officials and supporters moreover German expertise in fields like Administration the military construction and corporate firms could be put to good use at a time when Nations across the continent were experiencing rapid economic growth and industrialization this made immigration to South America an enticing option for German citizens struggling to survive in the post-war Devastation of their home country official immigration was often not an option for those attempting to avoid arrest with many enlisting the help of these so-called rat lines the rat lines were a system of Escape networks established by various organizations and individuals who sympathized with the Nazi cause controversially these networks also included members of both the British and American intelligence agencies who were eager to recruit xss intelligence agents and other former Nazi officials with anti-communist expertise in the Cold War against the Soviet Union starting in 1947 the U.S counterintelligence Corps recruited former SS members and helped them Escape Europe through Italy crucial in this endeavor was the help of sympathetic clergy men within the Catholic Church who opened up monasteries as safe havens and helped falsify travel documents for fleeing Nazis other organizations run by various neo-fascist and nationalist groups such as the Odessa Network similarly helped to facilitate the Escape of war criminals these Endeavors were costly and required not only the availability of shelter and food for the escapees but also necessitated the creation of fake documents the bribing of officials and the arrangement of overseas travel in order to finance these operations a variety of valuable items were utilized ranging from gold bars and diamonds to artwork and rare books that had been stolen from museums and private collections across Europe many of these resources were stored at churches and monasteries along the Escape Routes in Italy Austria Germany and Spain rumors of Nazi officials fleeing to South America spread almost as soon as the war ended the most famous among these theories was propagated by Joseph Stalin himself who for some time believed that Hitler managed to escape to Argentina through Spain however with the opening up of former Soviet archives and with advances in forensic evidence mainstream historians agree that such theories of his Escape are unlikely to be true however other high-ranking Nazi officials such as Adolf Eichmann Joseph Mengele and Klaus Barbie did manage to escape abroad Eichmann one of the architects of the Holocaust arranged to flee to Argentina under the false identity of Ricardo Clement where he worked in a Mercedes-Benz Factory protected by local Nazi sympathizers in the German community as well as the Catholic Church Eichmann lived a relatively normal life until he was finally captured in 1960 by Israeli agents he was brought to stand trial in Israel where he was found guilty of crimes against humanity and executed Joseph Mengele the feared SS physician who conducted sadistic medical experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz concentration camp similarly absconded to Argentina under the name of Helmut Gregor where he continued to work in an unlicensed medical practice during the following decade megala moved twice across South America to evade capture and finally died in 1979 in Brazil after having suffered a stroke while swimming in the ocean another Infamous fugitive was Klaus Barbie a high-ranking Gestapo officer known as The Butcher of Leon he had gained infamy for his role in torturing ants deporting French Resistance Fighters and Jews during the war after initially scraping a living on the black market in Germany Barbie was recruited by the U.S Army counter-intelligence Corps before he escaped to Argentina in 1951. the Bolivian government eventually hired him as a security advisor until he was finally extradited to France in 1983 where he was convicted of war crimes and died in prison in 1991. of all South American countries it was Argentina and its President Juan Perron in particular which actively sought to recruit German fugitives through his intelligence agency the s-i-d-e the authoritarian Perron sympathized with fascist ideology and wanted to utilize the valuable skills of former Nazi officials for Argentina's industrial and technological development before the war in neighboring Brazil president jetolio Vargas similarly wished to utilize the German expertise in technology to modernize his country's economy and infrastructure however after the war vargas's attitude toward German immigrants changed dramatically in part due to Brazil's military involvement in the war on the side of the Allies those suspected of being war criminals or of merely being sympathetic to Axis Powers were deported from the country other countries like Chile and Paraguay also endorsed the immigration of skilled German Workers either to help modernize their country in the case of the former or because of ideological sympathies as was the case for the latter regardless of the reasons for German immigration to South America there can be no doubt that the influx of skilled German labor had a significant influence on the development of their host Nations Advanced technological knowledge and skills played a major part in Industrial Development and in the modernization of South American economies in science german-run Endeavors like the Max Planck Institute in Brazil promoted scientific research and Germans across the continent made significant contributions to Fields such as medicine chemistry and physics culturally too German immigrants have had a lasting impact on their host nation's societies German music food and language have been integrated to varying degrees in countries such as Argentina Brazil and Chile no having said that not everything is beer and pretzels conflicts have Arisen in the past between German immigrants and the local population due to suspicions of Nazi sympathies and there remains an ongoing debate about whether South American countries have sufficiently acknowledged their role in harboring known war criminals as a result some Germans who had been living in South America were extradited to stand trial in Europe decades after the end of the war additionally some of these countries have since established memorials and museums dedicated to victims of Nazi atrocities nevertheless the Specter of Nazi Association continues to haunt South America to this day and the legacy of German immigration will continue to impact the continent for years to come thanks again to raid Shadow

formation tactics and fighting in lines was a pivotal part of European Warfare ever since ancient times from Alexander's phalixes to the Roman Legions and medieval Shield walls as long as men fought in pitched battles they organized themselves in some form of line or formation with the Advent of firearms infantry began to be deployed in large Square Columns of pikemen and Musketeers which allowed them to move around the battlefield as one unit and provide equal protection to each flank eventually with the introduction of bayonets Pikes fell out of favor and ranged infantry became the norm but at the end of the 18th century certain features of Ancient Warfare still seem to be present smoothbore guns had neither much more accuracy nor reach than the slings and bows that they replaced with a brown best musket having an effective range of a hundred yards or 91 meters furthermore for close fighting swords bayonets and lances were still relied upon still some Innovations were made and it became clear that shallow linear formations were more advantageous than deep columnar ones when it came to maximizing the number of troops who could see and shoot a given Target no longer were formations eight men deep but rather two or three and any more would make it difficult and risky for the backfile to fire the innate inaccuracy of muskets was one of the main reasons why armies used volley fire ing a line of muskets at the same target created a saturation effect guaranteeing that some of the shots hit the enemy this is why in training soldiers were drilled to fire as quickly as possible as in many instances it was the sheer volume of fire that decided the outcome of an encounter a regiment that could shoot four shots in a minute had a clear advantage over one that could only return two or three as for their stance most soldiers had to remain standing while reloading as the process required the use of gravity to pour gunpowder down the barrel soldiers were also organized shoulder to shoulder to cram as many men as possible in a small area to increase the number of muscles aiming downfield at any given time increasing the Firepower of the formation combat in this era was about intimidating the enemy and forcing him to retreat from the battlefield volley fire helped take down large sections of an opposing Force which could break morale and cause a route linear Warfare was often a giant game of chicken to see which side would flee first volleys were often followed by bayonet charges in an attempt to attack gaps in a line and drive the enemy into a route even if line formations were the most adequate tactic for combat at the time there is no denying that it was still psychologically agonizing to fight in such a manner for the individual Soldier so why did they obey in the most disciplined European armies infantry were drilled constantly and could be punished heavily for insubordination the prussians in particular were notorious for this with one type of punishment calling for two ranks of soldiers assembled with the offender made to walk between them and being lashed by each man as he passed American military commander and President George Washington also understood the importance of officers and heavy Drilling and as a result had a very poor opinion of militia even stating that depending on militia was like resting on a broken staff having morale break in one unit could lead to other units breaking too which is something he also recognized writing in a letter that he was Disturbed at the conduct of the militia whose behavior and want of discipline has done great injury to the other troops who never had officers except in a few instances worth the bread they eat one of the most significant reasons as to why infantry willingly stayed in close order formations was the threat of Cavalry when infantry was not in a close order formation such as Square line or attack column they were especially vulnerable as each man's flanks would be unprotected and exposed if a unit had too much space between each man Cavalry could charge through these gaps do serious damage and keep riding just to reform on the other side and repeat the whole process Again by maintaining a cohesive formation infantry could present itself as a united front against a cavalry charge as few horses are willing to impale themselves on a wall of bayonets line formations were still vulnerable to Cavalry Charges from the rear and flanks which is why some armies drilled their soldiers to be able to form the aforementioned square formation which was much more effective against cavalry the British famously used this formation at the Battle of Waterloo against nay's Infamous charge there was one downside to this formation however closed formations were more vulnerable to artillery fire in a time when artillery was not particularly accurate this was a risk that most generals were comfortable with for many centuries another benefit of fighting in lines is that it was easier to maneuver large numbers of men in a rigid formation as otherwise they would have been separated and disoriented musket fire produced a great deal of smoke which meant that after a couple of volleys the visibility on a battlefield could be significantly reduced by staying in formation the men would know who was on either side of them and keep unit cohesion at a time when Battlefield communication was only conducted through shouts musical instruments and flags it was imperative to stay in formation to avoid loss of organization and keep lines from breaking in the event of an attack and division of an army effective communication could evaporate entirely making a proper defense or assault impossible to coordinate while line infantry was the backbone of the armies at the time this did not mean that all fighting was conducted in this way unconventional and Guerrilla tactics were employed all throughout history especially during the French and Indian War where forests and broken terrain were more prevalent than the Open Fields in Europe making guerrilla warfare far more effective European armies would also employ light infantry which were trained to use cover spread out and conceal themselves to harass the enemy and Screen the primary battle formations still it is important to point out that if they were ever caught by Cavalry light infantry would also attempt to form into tight ranks to fend off a charge or look to retreat to the relative safety of line infantry or broken Terrain finally with the development of more Accurate Firearms Anthony ball there was a great increase of lethality while using line formations this was especially the case during the American Civil War which also saw armies adapting to trench warfare in sieges like Atlanta Vicksburg and Petersburg these new weapons could also disrupt Cavalry Charges at long distances which diminished the use of both Mast infantry formations and Cavalry alike regardless lines continued to be used in some capacity up until the first world war which resulted in prolific casualties suffered by units during the start of the war it was not until breach loading rifles mass-produced machine guns and breech-loaded artillery was fully adopted that the age of close order tactics became entirely obsolete while it is undoubtedly true that the site of lines of men standing in front of each other and seemingly taking turns to shoot each other seems ludicrous to the modern viewer it was the best way of fighting with what was at hand at the time if there were a better way of fighting generals would not have chosen to fight in lines at the detriment of their chances of winning a battle it was only due to the Industrial Revolution and the massive technological improvements that came with it that formation fighting became obsolete of course Warfare would continue to evolve and after the first world war it had thoroughly transitioned to something more familiar to the modern eye\",\n",

research and development many Concepts that reach the wider public barely pass the Prototype phase much less the assembly line with some Concepts that came out of Germany however a few were downright conspiratorial perhaps the most famous of these make-believe Marvels was digalaka or the Bell described as an anti-gravity Flying Saucer made by the Nazis but never actually deployed credible research and evidence claims that no such device was ever proposed or even existed at all yet the myth stubbornly clings to the fringes of historical conspiracies since its first appearance in Igor vitkovsky's book The Truth About the vondervaffa back in 2000. veering out of pure fiction we step out into the less ridiculed but nonetheless amusing world of proposals here the most bizarre idea came in the form of the zoninga or sun gun this theoretical design was first proposed by German physicist Herman Obert in 1929 who drew up plans for a space station equipped with a nine square kilometer concave mirror which would concentrate reflected sunlight onto the Earth for a devastating effect obert's idea was adopted by a group of German scientists at the German Army artillery Proving Grounds at Hiller's Laban where the plans for this orbital death ray were seriously considered and the scientists in charge of the project believed that construction could be completed within 50 to 100 years in actuality the concept was flawed from the start given how light interacts with mirrors at certain focal lengths simply put the proposed distance of the zoningivea from the Earth would have produced a reflection from the Sun numbering around 64 kilometers in diameter too large to produce any kind of damaging Heat at worst the Allies would have to squint their eyes looking up at the sky the more realistic aspects of Germany's research and development delved into the capabilities of tanks on the battlefield these experiments were pushed to their limits through several projects one such vehicle was the kugupansa also known as the ball tank this small one-man armored vehicle is shrouded in mystery as no records or documentation have ever been found only one prototype was discovered and it was actually captured by the Soviets in 1945 after being given to the Japanese its design specifically its lack of armament suggested that the ball tank may have been envisioned for reconnaissance the Land Cruiser pay 1000 rata or rat was another experimental tank concept it was a proposed super heavy tank that would have weighed 1 000 tons and featured two 280 millimeter SKC 34 Naval cannons as its primary armaments the plans for the rat were approved by Adolf Hitler himself in 1942 but there is some debate among historians about whether the massive blueprints discovered after the war were ever truly intended for production contrasting the rather wild concepts of German armor like the kugelpanza more serious programs were established that looked to create a new type of super heavy class tank these tanks were intended to be superior to the tanks used by the allies with heavier armor and more powerful guns the initial idea of the rat's 1000 ton design was scrapped yet the core idea was never fully dropped as work began on the Panzer 8 mouse or Mouse weighing in at a more conservative 180 tons it was nonetheless monstrous in weight as well as Armament with its 128 millimeter and 75 millimeter cannons this way also led to a number of Technical and logistical problems ultimately only two prototypes were completed despite many of these projects beginning in the early War experimental weapon development began receiving serious attention around mid to late 1942 Albert Speer the minister of armaments and war production oversaw the establishment of the wunderfaffen program part of his effort to boost the legitimacy of Hitler's regime through propaganda based on arms manufacturing and leaned heavily into the promise of these incredible Miracle weapons as a means of turning the tide of the war the most notable of these projects were the V1 and V2 rocket programs while technically impressive the targeting capabilities of these weapons were extremely inaccurate launched from sites within access territory these Rockets were only viable for indiscriminate bombing of large Urban centers like London or Antwerp killing approximately 18 000 people during the war the V2 rocket was developed and assembled almost exclusively by slave laborers drawn from the inmates of the middle Mount Dora concentration camp in central Germany thousands of these laborers were subject to nightmarish conditions with many dying as a result in addition to the V weapons advancements in the German armored focus in heavy class tanks led to the adoption of the tiger 2 also known as the King Tiger it was heavily armed and armored weighing roughly 70 tons and required a crew of five to operate the tiger 2 was considered one of the most powerful tanks of the war with a powerful 88 millimeter gun and thick armor but its production was slow and costly and only saw limited use on the eastern and western fronts advancements in jet aircraft design led to the eventual creation of the heikel he-162 and Messerschmitt me 262 along with these was the me163 comet the world's first operational rocket-powered fighter which essentially used a rocket engine to take off at absurd speeds making it the first piloted aircraft to exceed 1 000 kilometers per hour in level flight overshadowing the frightening reputation of its highly volatile and corrosive rocket propellant which killed more than its fair share of Pilots outside vehicular development more productive and substantial projects to come out of the wonder weapon programs include the stg-44 the world's first operational assault rifle which some say inspired the Soviets AK-47 but the two guns did not share much in common on the technical level along with small arms breakthroughs support equipment was also devised like the idealgorate 1229 vampire an infrared gun sight for the stg-44 that served as one of the first night vision devices used in all Warfare while impressive these breakthroughs arrived during Nazi Germany's Perpetual crippling resource shortages which prevented any of these devices from being produced in significant enough numbers to make any real difference in the war notably among Germany's engineering Ventures the Nazis also had a nuclear weapons program known as the oran ferine or uranium club which made significant progress toward developing nuclear warheads to go on to the V2 missiles however the program was consistently held back by a lack of available funding and resources ultimately the allied-led operation gunnerside destroyed production facilities involved in the manufacturing of heavy water vital to the program at vimorg Norway which derailed the uranium club and ended any chance of German nuclear warheads becoming a reality after the war most of these weapons prototypes and testing grounds were captured intact by the Allies information picked out for Destruction was related to human experimentation and other crimes against humanity however many of these researchers involved in these wonderful projects were brought over to the United Kingdom Soviet Union and United States to continue their work well into the Cold War what other Wonder Weapons

       " \" foreign Johnson the armchair historian the invasion of Normandy on June 6 1944 or D-Day as it's more commonly known is one of the most well-documented events of the second world war countless books movies and even video games have covered The Landings on the Normandy Coast in great detail yet it can be confusing to figure out exactly how each Landing was different what the German defenses looked like and what exactly happened once the invasion forces got off the beaches as such we'll be zooming out from the chaos on the ground to give you a bird's eye perspective of the D-Day Landings first we'll be flying across the American sectors from the chaotic nighttime drop of the Airborne all the way to the Advance off of Omaha Beach foreign the invasion of Normandy codenamed Operation Overlord commenced in the late hours of June 5th 1944 as an armada of c-47 Transport planes carrying the American 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions made its way toward the kutanta peninsula the elite paratroopers were entrusted with the crucial task of Paving the way for the Seabourn forces landing at Utah Beach just after Dawn the 101st would secure the causeways between the towns of Saul Marton duverival and pupaville while the 82nd would capture the crossroads at the town of salmer iglese and secure the vital Bridges across the maraday river at chef de Paul and La Fiera Menor however things go awry almost immediately as thick Inland cloud cover and intense ground fire complicated things for the pilots in the resulting chaos most paratroopers miss their Drop Zones entirely as they are scattered all across the peninsula those who land safely nonetheless manage to quickly form makeshift units as they make their way to the nearest objective in most cases the confused German Defenders are quickly overwhelmed Saul mayor igles becomes the first French town to be liberated at around 4 30 a.m as men of the 82nd dig in for the expected counter-attack at the LA fierre Manor and Chef dupaul Bridges to the West the bulk of the 101st due east in the meantime are in the process of clearing the five causeways to The Landing Beach where the invasion Force anchored just offshore is about to make its approach the fleet's target was a five kilometer stretch of flat Sandy Beach just east of the Airborne Drop Zones codenamed Utah Beach on board of the invasion Fleet were the men of the fourth infantry division their objective was to establish a beachhead approximately five kilometers wide and eight kilometers deep with the ultimate goal to isolate the kutanta peninsula and capture the deep water Port of cherborg the first step in achieving this objective would be to break through the defensive position of the German 709th static Infantry Division before advancing Inland on the five main road exits besides flooding the nearby Farm Fields The Defenders had littered Utah beach with three lines of obstacles consisting of steel spikes and mined wooden posts as well as an array of anti-tank obstacles the Utah sector was covered by nine resistance nests or wiederschtan's nesten which were manned by platoon strength garrisons totaling about 700 troops at 5 50 the fleet commences its bombardment of known German positions along the coast meanwhile 270 bombers close in to further soften up the German strong points however hindered by poor visibility and anxious not to hit the invasion Force few Pilots managed to hit their targets at 6 30 hours the first wave of 20 landing craft carrying part of the eighth regiment approaches the Beach's two sectors Uncle red and Tara green they are supposed to have landed behind a Vanguard of amphibious DD or duplex Drive tanks of the 70th tank battalion the 70th tanks however are struggling to advance in the face of heavy headwinds and way to shore late around 6 45 AM luckily for the Infantry German resistance is lighter than expected and besides some small arms fire most casualties on the beach fall victim to artillery fire ant mines as it turns out these strong swell that morning pulled the landing craft a mile or 1.5 kilometers Southward to a sector less well defended than the previously designated Landing site despite this Good Fortune incoming artillery fire covering the various Beach exits continues to cause casualties and hamper the advance throughout the early morning hours a few miles Inland paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division resolved the issue as they conduct a set of Daring assaults to silence the German batteries at oldie and bracor Manor with these guns neutralized the men of the 4th Infantry Division managed to overrun the remaining German Beach defenses and by 8 30 hours are ready to begin their Advance up the causeways around noon men of the eighth regiment make contact with elements of the 101st Airborne Division at pupaville further Inland at Saul Marie dumal the regiment's Third Battalion prepares for a battle but finds the town already liberated by Troopers of the 506th parachute Infantry Regiment who had cleared it in close quarters fighting earlier that day the Swift and mostly painless advance of the eighth regiment is finally ordered to a halt at the end of the day at the crossroads at leforge some 10 kilometers Inland meanwhile men from the 12th and 22nd regiments Landing in follow-up waves moved to secure the northern and Northwestern flanks of the beachhead until they too penetrate around 10 kilometers into german-held territory by the end of the day the Utah operation had been a success the fourth infantry division had achieved nearly all of its objectives in return for just 197 casualties a number far lower than had been anticipated the Airborne divisions had suffered more heavily during their chaotic nighttime drop but they too had managed to achieve the majority of their primary objectives within 24 hours the Americans had established a firm beachhead on the kutanta peninsula through a mixture of exemplary skill and sheer luck some 23 250 men and 1700 Vehicles were ashore with countless more to follow in the days weeks and months to come these fortunes however would be in short supply for the American forces set to land further east foreign [Music] kilometers to the east of Utah Beach a group of 225 elite soldiers from the second ranger battalion under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James Rudder are headed towards the protruding Cliffs of the Punta du Hawk the Rangers were entrusted with the daunting task of scaling the 30 meter high Cliffs to prevent its artillery battery from pummeling the American Invasion beaches once on top the Americans would have to fight their way through a series of defensive works and obstacles manned by men from the 716th static Infantry Division in order to reach the gun emplacements things don't start out well for rudder's men on D-Day his troops are scheduled to land at 6 30 but due to a navigational mishap they don't reach the beach until 10 past 7. the alerted Germans greet the Rangers with small arms fire grenades and even rocks as the latter begin making their way up the cliff by 7 30 hours the first exhausted Rangers have made their way to the top to find a moon-like landscape of deep craters created by preliminary bombardment in a wild and frenzied scene Rutter's men stormed the emplacements only to find that the guns are not there fears that their sacrifice had been for nothing are soon alleviated when a patrol finds that the guns are intact in a field just behind the puenta with their main objective completed the remaining Rangers dig in for the inevitable German counter-attack and wait to be relieved by The Invasion Force landing at the neighboring Omaha Beach the Western end of Omaha Beach lay just about six kilometers to the east of puenta du Hawk and stretched all the way from the area around virival sumera to the cliffs near Colleyville Sumer some eight kilometers to the east the most prominent characteristic of this wide and mostly Sandy Beach was a series of Bluffs which offered a commanding view over the coastline five natural draws between the Bluffs offered the only exits off the beach for vehicles and heavy Ordnance the Germans were well aware of the potential for a landing in the Omaha sector and had constructed an intricate web of obstacles and resistance nests to cover the approaches to the draws the beach itself had been littered with obstacles of all kinds soldiers disembarking in the shallows would first have to Traverse an array of mined stakes and iron frames as well as Hedgehog anti-tank obstacles barbed wire covered the sea wall and dunes further on while the draws were blocked off by minefields and concrete walls as well as remote controlled flamethrowers furthermore in order for soldiers in most sectors to even reach the draws they would have to cross the Shelf which was a roughly football field sized gap of open ground between the sea wall and the base of the Bluffs but to even get to that point the Americans would have to Brave a deadly and sophisticated set of resistance nests most of these strong points were hidden from sight camouflaged and placed at an angle to protect them from enemy fire the slight curve of the coastline also meant that resistance nests on both the eastern and western edges of the beach could provide interlocking fields of fire Across The Landing ground three additional resistance nests were positioned behind the Bluffs should the Invaders manage to break through in total the resistance nests in the Omaha sector were composed of eight big gun emplacements 35 pill boxes 18 anti-tank guns and 85 machine gun nests being the largest and the most well-defended of the two American beaches Allied command had assigned both the 29th Infantry Division as well as the veteran first Infantry Division to secure the Bluffs by 7 30 hours link up with the British forces advancing from Gold Beach at poor om basal and securing an overall beachhead 26 kilometers wide and eight kilometers deep at 5 555 hours the preliminary air and Naval bombardment begins pounding the German positions but once again the bomber Pilots delay too long and end up missing their target entirely with the German defenses still intact the first wave begins to make its Approach at 6 30. some landing craft are hit as they close in on the beach and many soldiers are cut down to make matters worse almost all of the DD tanks that were supposed to land ahead of the Infantry have floundered in the rough Channel Waters after having been launched far too early at 5.5 kilometers from the shore within minutes companies a and F of the 116th Infantry Regiment landing at dog green and dog red are virtually wiped out however not every sector of Omaha is as well defended at dog white G company reaches the base of the beach within four minutes of Landing while at Fox red at the Far Eastern end of Omaha men from the 16th regiment make use of the cliffs in that sector to Shield themselves from enemy fire at around eight o'clock a group of men under command of General Norman coda in the dog white sector managed to blow a hole in the barbed wire in the dog white sector and Advance up these steep Bluffs to take out wn-70 before moving on to clear the fear of the old draw to the east in the fox sector a group of soldiers led by Lieutenant Jimmy W Monteith similarly managed to fight their way up the exit and take out wn60 the majority of the troops near the draws are however still hopelessly pinned down and their sectors quickly become congested with the arrival of subsequent waves to make matters worse the incoming tide begins to shallow the wounded and the dead while slowly reducing the size of the beach even further sensing catastrophe a group of U.S Navy destroyers Brave enemy fire as they move in as close as 800 meters from the shoreline with their direct fire support eight German gun emplacements are knocked out providing enough of an opening for the ground troops to recontine their Advance up the bluffs with the German defenses now being breached in several sectors the tide begins to turn in the Americans favor the assault teams on the Bluffs quickly Swing West and East to flank the remaining German positions while the other groups Advance on the towns of Fairville and Colleyville Sumer by the end of the day the Americans at Omaha had secured the Bluffs but the advance off the beach had only reached 1.5 kilometers Inland this precarious foothold on the Normandy Coast had come at the cost of over 4 000 U.S casualties still Omaha had been secured and the Germans lacked the strength to attempt to push the Americans back into the channel by Nightfall of June 6 1944 it was clear that the American Landings had succeeded despite the initial chaos of the U.S Airborne Landings The efforts at Utah Beach had been nothing short of an astounding success Omaha Beach on the other hand had veered dangerously close to catastrophe yet here too the Americans had ultimately established a firm foothold that was only to expand in the days and weeks to come however relative success in the American sectors did not equate to the success of D-Day as a whole arguably the most important of all the landings on June 6th were taking place further to the east where British forces were attempting to capture the medieval city of Khan and prepare for a clash with the brunt of the German armored Reserves foreign it's just past midnight on June 6 1944 as a group of gliders descend toward the Norman Countryside inside our paratroopers of the British sixth Airborne Division they have been tasked with securing two bridges over the Khan canal and the river worn on the far East flank of the scheduled Allied Landings in Normandy within 15 minutes the assault teams managed to completely overwhelm these small German garrisons guarding the bridges and dig in as they await the arrival of the rest of the division the bulk of the sixth Airborne was set to land just east of the river Oren where they were to destroy five bridges over the river Dev and silence the mareville gun battery overlooking sword Beach however in a near replay of the American drop for visibility and navigational errors caused the paratroopers to be scattered all across the Norman Countryside fortunately the area of operations lack the thick bokage that would come to haunt The Americans making it far easier for the paratroopers to swiftly link up in large groups to the east designated units set out to destroy the bridges over the Deep River while a small group of 160 peras out of a plant 600 proceed to assault the heavily defended Maryville battery to the north the fierceness of the following battle depletes nearly half of the assault team's strength but by 5 30 am the battery is under British control opening the way for the invasion Force anchored offshore to begin making its approach [Music] stretching about eight kilometers from the seaside town of wistram to Saint Alba Sumer this beach was to be the Eastern flank of Operation Overlord swords significance lay in its proximity to the city of Khan which was a major road Hub located just 12 kilometers from the beach the British third infantry division had been ordered to lead the assault on sword Beach and if possible liberate Khan before the end of the day secondary objectives were awarded to the elite units of the first special service Brigade whose men were ordered to link up with the Canadians landing on Juno Beach just off to the West as well as relieve the embattled paratroopers of the sixth Airborne Division to the southeast opposing the British Invasion force was the German 716th static Infantry Division as a first line of defense its men had littered the beach with minefields and obstacles of all kinds beyond that the Brits would have to Brave a series of resistance nests which stretched from the coastline all the way to Khan the most notable amongst these were two formidable Inland strong points codenamed Morris and Hillman these veritable fortresses were armed with heavy artillery anti-tank weaponry and machine gun emplacements and were perfectly positioned to block and Advance on Khan however the Germans real Ace in the Hole came in the form of the 21st Panzer Division stationed near Khan their presence in the area presented the defender's best chance of forcing the British troops back into the channel as such it was imperative for the success of the entire Invasion that the third infantry division get off the beach as quickly as possible the citizens of Khan are still recovering from the impact of the preliminary bombardment when they first wave of landing craft and amphibious duplex drive or DD tanks set off toward the shoreline with most of the German resistance nests still intact the Vanguard of the third infantry division face strong initial opposition several landing craft and vehicles are Hit Upon Landing as the Infantry struggled to reach the beach exits in the Roger sector on the easternmost flank French and British Commandos find themselves caught in a bitter struggle around the heavily fortified Casino in the town of wistram further west the fourth special service Brigade tasked with linking up with the Canadians at Juno Beach finds themselves similarly pinned down by heavy enemy Fire coming from the Cod strong point in the town of Leon Sumer fortunately for the Brigade The belated arrival of the sluggish DD tanks and other armored vehicles quickly changes the tide of battle sword however is still under Fire from German positions on the Perrier Ridge just south of airmanville as overwhelmed engineer teams frantically try to clear Lanes off the increasingly congested Beach hours pass but luckily for the British the expected German counter-attack fails to materialize to the South the frustrated men of the 21st Panzer Division idle uselessly as they await explicit orders from the fuhrer to attack the beachhead the fuhrer however is still soundly asleep as the bulk of the invasion Force finally begins moving off the beach on the Eastern flank the men of the number four Commando unit have managed to clear out Westrom while just to the South the first special service Brigade are the first to make contact with the beleaguered paratroopers at the Khan canal and River orange Bridges however in the center the advance off the beach is quickly reduced to a crawl at these strong points Morris and Hillman the former Falls after about an hour of heavy fighting but the latter's defenses prove far more formidable than anticipated fighting at Hillman continues well into the evening obstructing any further advances in that area to make matters worse at four o'clock the 21st Panzer Division finally arrives on the front line to begin their counter-attack its tanks strike right in between the British and Canadian lines but the timely appearance of Allied armor causes heavy casualties on the charging panzers despite these losses the Germans pressed the attack and at seven o'clock some surviving elements managed to reach the coast these depleted units however lack the strength to exploit their breakthrough and are subsequently ordered to withdraw having braved the German counter-attack the third infantry division attempt a final dash for Khan marching down the urmonville Khan Road on foot its men reach as far as Beeville bovillville a mere seven kilometers from the cons City Center however a lack of sufficient armor support and coordination with the neighboring Canadians forces the Infantry to pull back as the day draws to a close positioned right in the middle of the Normandy invasion the Gold Beach sector stretched from poor olympusal to the west to versumer some 16 kilometers to the East High Cliffs on its Western end separated gold from the neighboring Americans at Omaha Beach and forced the British to land on a flat stretch of ground between LA Amel and LA riviere the experienced British 50th Infantry Division had been entrusted to link up with both the American and Canadian beachheads sever the road and Railway to Khan and capture the city of Bayou some 13 kilometers inland opposing the 50th division would be elements of both the German 716th and 352nd infantry divisions including a mobile Response Unit in the form of comp groupa Meyer 11 resistance nests as well as two partially completed Coastal Gun batteries augmented the defense further though few were made out of the near indestructible concrete that characterized the Omaha sector at 5 30 am the head pounding Roar from bombarding Force K signals the start of the preliminary Naval bombardment crucially three of the Four Guns of the long zumaire Coastal Gun battery are knocked out by direct hits the first wave following in the bombardments Wake however quickly finds out that the powerful strong points at La Amel and La Riviera are still very much intact within short succession several tanks and other vehicles are knocked out as the Infantry Scurry behind the sea wall fortunately a specialized flail tank is quick to react and manages to silence the deadly 88 millimeter gun at La riviere before it has a chance to do more damage further to the West in The Jig sector elements of the first hampshires managed to neutralize the more weakly defended position at the Village of NL before circling Inland to attack these strong points at La Amel from the rear meanwhile in the king sector infantry of the 5th East Yorkshires begin to systematically clear out the Fortified houses at La riviere along the shore while flail tanks try to clear out lanes for The Invasion force to move inland with the immediate Landing Zone coming under Allied control men of the first Battalion Hampshire regiment managed to seize aramaj while the 47th Royal Marine Commando march on poor on the song to link up with the neighboring Americans back at King the sixth green Howards with armor from the Dragoon guards clear a lane of the beach and move to assault the batteries at mall flurry and ver Sumer joined by the 5th East Yorkshire they continue to advance down the road before clashing with Camp grupa Meyer near the town of brazenville luckily for the British the battle group was caught by surprise and virtually annihilated during the following engagement with most of the immediate German resistance neutralized or subdued the British Vanguard managed to link up with the Canadians but lack the strength to make the final push to bayu before nightfall by midnight on June 6 the British Invasion Force had succeeded in achieving about half of its objectives at sword close to 29 000 men had come ashore at the cost of around 1 000 casualties the sixth Airborne on its part had secured a beachhead on the Eastern Bank of the orange while blocking the way for the Germans to reinforce the defense of the beach crucially though the British had not been able to capture Khan on the first day a failure that would prove extremely costly for the Allies as it allowed the Germans time to reinforce their line with several Elite Panzer divisions the Norman City would not finally be liberated until July 19th at Gold Beach around 24 500 men occupied the largest Allied beachhead of the entire Invasion at the relatively merciful cost of 400 casualties the 50th Infantry Division had shattered the German defensive positions opposing them and connected its run with the Canadians at Juno Beach although the Brits had failed to contact the Americans and capture Bayou they stood poised to liberate the weakly defended City on the following day special thanks to the sponsor of today's

Allied planners had anticipated their Canadian comrades were to be less fortunate we'll take a closer look at The Landings on Juno Beach also known as the Canadian Omaha [Applause] [Music] stretching around eight kilometers from Santo ball Sumer in the East to Corso Sumer in the west Juno Beach was situated in between the British sectors of gold and sword its most significant Landmark was the copy K Airfield located some 17 kilometers Inland just to the west of the city of Khan Allied planners had made it a priority to expand Allied air superiority as soon as possible and the capture of copy K was deemed an important first step to achieve this goal the Canadian third infantry division had been assigned to assault up the beach seized the Airfield and sever the Paris cherborg Railway line if possible the third infantry division would also support a potential assault on Khan with British forces advancing from sword Beach like their British comrades in arms the Canadian Invasion force would face units of the German 716th static Infantry Division which had positioned themselves in pill boxes and fortified houses in various fishing villages along the coast the most formidable of these resistance nests were located in Bernier Sumer and Santo balsumer whose large vacation homes provided the Defenders with excellent Vantage points over the beach while skillfully positioned gun emplacements could pick off approaching armor at range Elsewhere on Rails machine gun teams had the ability to rapidly reposition their heavy equipment to suppress large sections of the beach at dawn the Allied Armada offshore opens fire on the German batteries and strong points in the Juno Beach sector as the men of the Canadian 7th and 8th brigades ready themselves to open the assault on the beach at 7 30 the first landing craft set off from their assembly points but the Rough Waters of the channel quickly slow the advance to the beach the Germans in the meantime have suffered only minor damage from the opening bombardment as they prepare themselves to meet the first wave with withering fire at around 7 50 landing craft carrying engineer elements of the royal Winnipeg rifles are the first to lower their ramps in the mic sector near Corso Sumer while delayed elements of the Queen's own and Royal Regina rifles are closing in further to the east in the Nan sector many of the amphibious duplex Drive tanks of the first hussars that were supposed to come ashore alongside the Infantry faltered in the channel Waters with only 14 arriving on the beach intact lacking adequate armor support the winnipegs men are mercilessly cut down by intense German fire further to the West other elements find the German strong points opposing them greatly weakened or already destroyed by the preliminary bombardment after a brief firefight the few remaining positions are neutralized as the Canadians begin to advance inland further to the east in the nand sector the Regina rifles

Baker for his part insists that his talks with Gorbachev applied solely to East Germany and he never ruled out NATO expansion in the slightest nevertheless Gorbachev and many officials from both the former USSR and current Russian Federation view Gorbachev's talks with Baker as something of a promise and even future CIA director Robert Gates opined that the Soviets had been led to believe NATO would not accept Eastern European members the collapse of the USSR in 1991 would turn the situation on its head as the new Russian Federation grappled with internal strife and The Growing Pains of trying to transition from a single party rule to democracy the former nations of the Warsaw Pact ID the possibility of joining NATO Russia would attempt to preempt this by forming the United Armed Forces later called the collective security Treaty Organization in 1992 a collective defense compact in NATO's spirit this initial group consisted of Russia Armenia Belarus Kazakhstan Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan despite these csto the possibility of former Soviet States joining NATO was still on the table perhaps even Russia would be brought into their former enemies fold for their part NATO leaders were willing to admit new members only if they could contribute to the Block's goal of collective security this disqualified Russia outright as the newly birthed Nation contended with military and intelligence communities squarely out of state control a constitutional crisis in 1993 as Boris Yeltsin began consolidating power and Terror and counter-terror in chechnya all problems that made Russia untrustworthy in NATO eyes America's two-track policy expanded NATO into Eastern Europe while simultaneously and separately working with Russia the U.S and Russia would embark on a series of high-level talks culminating in Russia participating in the partnership for peace initiative a NATO program that allowed the young country to observe NATO militaries and learn best practices for keeping one's Army under control of a democratic government as a partner for peace Russian forces would go on to serve alongside nato peacekeepers in Bosnia and Serbia but Russian action in Serbia did not come from a true Alliance Russia had long held Serbia as a friend and Ally and viewed NATO intervention in the Balkan Wars overall as flouting International order the Russian public began to hold NATO up as an international Force asserting itself to Russia's detriment and recast Gorbachev as a passive leader who did not so much give the West an inch but rather handed over a mile in 1997 the Russia NATO founding Act was signed by both sides giving Russia Observer status in NATO but no power to veto The Taking of collective military action or admission of new States despite Gorbachev's Recollections and the beliefs of Russian officials NATO would expand into the post-soviet world some former warsaw-packed countries were aggressive in lobbying for NATO membership with Poland in particular knocking on NATO's door not long after breaking up with Russia Poland would get its way in 1999 being welcomed into NATO alongside the Czech Republic and Hungary an even larger expansion in 2004 would include Slovakia Slovenia Bulgaria and Romania but most importantly all three Baltic states Estonia Latvia and Lithuania it is this last admission that was the most infuriating to Russia historically the Baltic states had been Russian protectorates and later annexed by these Soviets Continental Europe had never accepted this state of affairs and the three Baltic states had made plain their wish to purge Russian influence as quickly as possible their admission into NATO brought competing military interests right to Russia's front door and Russia threatened their former vassals with economic retaliation and statements that they're putting Russian military equipment into NATO hands undermined International Security agreements Russia's words only drove the Baltic states further into NATO's camp with the Latvian foreign minister saying that his country's push to join was specifically meant as a safeguard against Russia as the former Warsaw paced Nations established themselves as independent States leaders sympathetic to Russia found themselves swept out of office by revolutionary groups such as the 2003 Rose revolution in Georgia or Ukraine's 2004 orange Revolution this New Nationalism would bring NATO and Russia to a flash point in 2008 with Kosovo declaring independence from close Russian Ally Serbia the U.S UK France and most NATO countries rushed to recognize kosovar Independence while Russia China and a minority of NATO members refused Russia warned against welcoming Kosovo onto the international stage declaring that doing so violated Serbia's territorial integrity under U.N law and would create a dangerous domino effect this domino effect would be on full display that same year during the Russian Georgian war from 2003 to 2008 the U.S invested Millions into the young country of Georgia training and Advising its military and endorsing future NATO membership for Georgia and Ukraine Georgia needed U.S Aid as they had long dealt with russian-backed separatists in the region of South Oceania separatists who in August 2008 shelled villages in violation of a ceasefire act taking American statements on NATO membership as a de facto military Alliance Georgia sent troops to stop the separatists and provoked a full-scale Invasion by Russia who declared Georgia's movement attempted genocide of the South ossetian people after five days of conflict a French broken piece would see the South Oceania and another region abkasia recognized as independent by Russia Russia cited kosovo's Independence as justification for South ossetian Independence yet the region is only recognized by a handful of countries Georgia would not be the only former Soviet state to see conflict over Russian influence in the 2000s Ukraine would be plunged into internal chaos following the Ukrainian government's sudden reversal of a long-awaited partnership with the European Union in 2013. president Victor Yanukovych announced he would pursue closer ties to Russia leading to widespread protests and counter-protests by pro-russian parties in Russia's eyes this outpouring of pro-eu sentiment was the worst possible scenario anti-russian regime change combined with a Groundswell in favor of the European Union and NATO from a nation that was traditionally in their sphere of influence of particular concern was the fate of sevastopol a poor on the Crimean Peninsula that had long been a key strategic location Crimea would prove a Latter-Day South osisia as in response to the protests against yanukovych's U-turn a combination of pro-russian militias and Russian ground forces would occupy Crimea in early 2014. February would find the Russians seizing key government posts including the Crimean Parliament and in March a referendum was held to decide whether Crimea would remain in Ukraine or voluntarily be annexed by Russia the results came back 95 in favor with Putin applauding the success of Eastern European popular will even as the International Community decried that the vote was rigged Russia's cooperation with NATO as a welcome but powerless Outsider ended in the ballot boxes of Crimea as meaningful communication was terminated in protest of the annexation an undaunted Putin suggested that other areas of eastern Ukraine which were home to ethnic Russian majorities or enclaves would be welcome to join the Russian Federation meanwhile NATO forces masked in the newer member states a clear warning to Russia who responded by massing troops in Crimea April 2014 would see pro-russian forces accept Putin's invitation launching coups against the Ukrainian government in the Border regions of Donetsk and luhansk this donbass war continues at the time of writing having been absorbed into the larger conflict that broke out between Russia and Ukraine tension between Russia and NATO would continue to build as the 2010s wore on with turkey Downing a Russian fighter jet that allegedly violated their airspace though this incident was successfully smoothed over Russia bristled at the admission of Montenegro to Nato at the end of 2015 even as opposition lawmakers declared their support of Putin's regime to the point of trying to stop their own country's joining thank you as the 2010s became the 2020s NATO troops and Russian forces continued to mass and move posturing and staring each other down in a parallel to the most tense days of the Cold War Russian troops on the border with Ukraine were singled out with concern but Russia claims they were performing exercises these exercises occurred against the backdrop of intense Strife between NATO and Russia who continued to loudly decry NATO expansion and demanded that Ukraine who had begun to be seen as the next potential NATO recruit never be admitted to join the military Bloc to the point of demanding a legal agreement barring Ukraine from ever joining and a contract ending all future admission of Eastern European nations NATO Secretary General Yen stoltenberg was succinct in his response Russia has no voice in NATO's Affairs as if to prevent Ukraine joining NATO by any means Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022. the war continues to the time of production with Ukraine proving resilient Beyond any International expectation NATO troops have been further concentrated in the areas around Russia with Finland Sweden and Ukraine all applying for NATO membership in the immediate aftermath of the invasion Russia has stated that Finland and Sweden are free to join NATO but per Putin the expansion of military infrastructure in this region will certainly cause our response at the time of writing Finland has become NATO's newest member while Sweden's application has stalled due to political pressures unrelated to Russia Ukraine remains a focus of international sympathy and support but not a NATO member yet the Cold War left Europe polarized between the United States and Russia bereft of its network of buffer States the Russian Federation sought to manage the admission of former Soviet republics to Nato lest it be surrounded by potentially hostile Neighbors in service to its rival how this long conflict between Russia and the rest of Europe will end is a matter for another episode long or perhaps not so long in the future thanks again to our sponsor call of War enjoy rewriting history in this free online PVP strategy game by signing up using our Link in the description within the next 30 days and receive 13 000 gold and one month of Premium subscription for free\",\n",
       " \" thanks to ag-1 for sponsoring today's video [Music] Johnson the armchair historian Western history says that the Second World War Began on September 1st 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany but the Republic of China had fought Imperial Japanese aggression for a full eight years before the first panzers rolled into Poland and China would spend the war Riven with internal strife even as they beat back the Japanese in this video we will look at the second world war from the Chinese perspective who fought for their very existence as a people Imperial Japan first brought conflict to China with the 1931 invasion of Manchuria but this Conquest did not satiate their colonial Ambitions and the Empire thus began rattling the metaphorical Katana around Shanghai in 1932 before invading The jehol Province the following year 1936 would see the Japanese and Nazi Germany signed the anti-common turn pact and Chinese dictator Chiang Kai-shek began courting German support for his internal struggle against the Chinese Communist party or CCP who were quickly winning the hearts and Minds that his Chinese nationalist movement were cuomintang could not but ideological agreement did not bring peace as the Japanese moved on the soyuan province even as the Chinese and Germans traded anti-communist messages open War in China would break out following the Marco Polo

tanks or artillery to support them and scarcely a Navy or Air Force journalist Doo Jeong Yuen chronicled the struggles of Chinese troops each day they only got one meal because the supply transport core were so often bombed by enemy aircraft but what I felt saddest about was that when our side withdrew a lot of our seriously wounded Brothers had no one to look after them please tell me what are we fighting for finding both their backs to the wall the kuomintang and CCP would put aside their differences to form the second united front Mao Zedong himself declared all political parties and groups in the united front must help each other and make Mutual concessions for the sake of long-term cooperation but the newly christened war of Liberation against Japan would prove costly and the United Chinese were driven into a desperate fighting Retreat that lost the cities of Shanghai Hangzhou and Nan king among others the Japanese were brutal in their conquests and Nanking in particular would devolve into a carnival of depravity as Japanese soldiers committed crimes against humanity including the assault of Chinese women Slaughter of infants and other Horrors beyond comprehension the Japanese campaign of atrocities in Nan King is well known but the situation was Grim even before Japanese forces breached the Nationalist Capital Nan King was swollen with refugees who competed with locals for what scarce resources were available the situation became so dire that in the Nanking safety zone food Aid began to only be doled out for payment of a token fee though the poorest refugees were given Red tags to mark them as in need of free food [Music] um sanitation was non-existent with waste littering the city and building up inside houses with their soldiers marking up defeat after defeat and hope draining by the instant the literal stench of War hung over Nanking [Music] a Survivor who was 22 at the time recounted the Japanese crimes soldiers came to round people up after detaining us the Japanese soldiers took the three of us to a Riverside the moment we reached the Riverside the other two were hacked to death with swords [Music] one of them struck me with a sword at the back of my neck causing me to fall to the ground instantly still conscious I bit hard at the collar of the shabby Overcoat I was wearing to hold my breath in order to feign being hacked to death besides the wholesale Slaughter of General civilians it is estimated that over 20 000 women were victimized by the Japanese within the first month after Nan King's fall obtaining an exact number is Complicated by twin tragedies many women were killed following their assault while still others remained silent about their ordeal until their last days twenty thousand men were executed on false charges of being Chinese soldiers while thirty thousand actual Chinese troops were executed after capture in flagrant violation of international law but as the shattered brutalized city of Nanking settled into the rhythms of occupation in the Guangzhou newspaper an article on April 1st 1938 read after occupying the government organizations they spread out to conduct searches wantonly slaughtering our civilians civilians with shaved heads or other resemblance to a soldier were tied up without exception the situation appeared Bleak as Regional warlord turned nationalist General Han fuku ignored orders from Central Command and retreated from jianan to preserve his forces this led to the Japanese capturing of qingdao in January 1938 resulting in Han's execution on January 24th by a now Furious Chiang Kai-shek with Japanese forces occupying the north of Shandong in March the Yellow River defense line collapsed still the Chinese put up a stubborn resistance with reinforcements from Lee zong Ren's Army managing to humiliate the Japanese in the battle of terjong meanwhile Japanese atrocities had driven many Chinese into joining the fight with the Communists under Mao Zedong seeing a significant boost in volunteers for his Red Army which Grew From 50 000 to 500 000 over 1937 to 1938 by August the Red Army were able to form the new fourth Army and eighth route Army which were incorporated into the second united front commanded by Chiang Kai-shek but Japanese victories in 1938 saw the Chinese pushed to their limits resulting in a desperate scorched Earth maneuver infamously known as the yellow river floods in June 1938 nationalist saboteurs intentionally destroyed the Yellow River dikes in order to slow down the Japanese invasion the resulting flood waters displaced millions of people and caused massive destruction of homes crops and infrastructure tens of thousands of people died as a result of the floods and the economic impact was felt for years to come the flood also had significant military consequences as it slowed down the Japanese advance and enabled the Chinese forces to regroup and strengthen their defenses ultimately however it only held off the Japanese for a time as they eventually capture these cities Amoy Fu Chao kaifang and Wuhan by the time nationalist forces had retreated to Chon Ching in November prompted by Japanese brutalities U.S president Roosevelt gave the Chinese a liberty loan of 25 million dollars to help with recovery efforts British Burma also became a Chinese Supply Depot with the legendary Burma Road providing Overland transport of desperately needed supplies and materiel Chiang Kai-shek accepted foreign support with suspicion and sought to exploit his Western backers for his own ends despite their stance against Japanese aggression the kuomintang was far from a model of decency and throughout the war nationalist officials were notorious for embezzlement ineptitude and outright corruption deficits that would drive the Chinese people into the Open Arms of Mao Zedong 1939 would see the Chinese continue to lose territory and in 1940 the Japanese Consolidated their gains into a puppet state under ultra-conservative and anti-communist Wang Jin Wei who began pressuring the British to close the Burma Road that same year the U.S applied soft pressure to the Japanese embarking on limited iron and fuel embargoes that made their support of Chang's Republic inescapably clear but as it gained support from without the Republic found itself facing an old Enemy Within the second united front was an uneasy Alliance and the CCP grew increasingly impatient with having to take orders from the kuomintang who were aggravated in turn by highly successful CCP recruiting efforts in free China Chang's goal was to unite the people together under his flag alone 1941 would see the second united front collapse as the Communist new fourth Army fought kuomintang troops in what both sides claimed to be a traitorous ambush of their forces by the other side regardless of who ambushed whom 1941 would also see the Chinese begin to retake territory and turn the Japanese back in a defensive victory at the Second Battle of Changsha the empire was dealt another blow when the U.S Netherlands and Britain ended their trade in oil cutting Japan off from the world oil Market enraged and economically cornered the Japanese expanded their war of aggression bombing Pearl Harbor and launching their East Asian Blitzkrieg the sino-japanese war was now truly part of the second World War January 1942 saw the Japanese finally succeed in conquering Changsha and the Chinese defense became a scorched Earth one as the kuomintang and CCP withdrew they burned Bridges and stripped factories with many workers carrying off equipment in hopes of setting up shop in free China some Chinese troops withdrew to British India While others moved to reinforce defensive positions elsewhere in the country the Japanese would end the year capturing the city of Ley show which cut the Burma Road definitively Japan's attack on the United States and invasion of East Asia topped off a major crisis within the Chinese resistance despite the resistance once again fracturing along party lines both Nationalist and Communist forces continued to engage in Frontline actions guerrilla warfare sabotage and propaganda campaigns against the Japanese Invaders foreign Tang leadership attempted to resupply and reorganize troops with the help of American and British allies although corruption within the Nationalist upper circles led to friction with the West American funds that had been intended for use against Japan were instead directed toward fighting Communist forces who were gaining influence throughout Southern China thanks to the Guerrilla efforts of the rebuilt new fourth Army under Commander Chan Yi as 1943 dawned the nationalists began rebuilding their forces in India but not without struggle sixty to seventy percent of inductees did not finish basic training with the majority deserting while a full 20 starved to death behind Allied lines over 100 million dollars in materiel and Aid given to them by the U.S was siphoned off to prepare for an eventual conflict with the CCP after the war despite their travails four divisions were successfully reformed in India and flown back to China where 16 000 Chinese defeated 60 000 Japanese at the Battle of chengda in the Hunan Province progress was also made in Burma with Chinese forces advancing in North Burma In late 1943 to besiege Japanese troops in mayakina 1944 would see Chang Lobby for a joint offensive to reopen the Burma Road growing tired of the need to fly in troops to India for every resupply effort as Allied Engineers pushed to build new supply lines across-friendly territory Chang's forces achieved numerous victories such as the capture of Mount song and Burma around June 1944 however efforts to reopen the Burma route were severely hampered by the launch of operation Ichigo a Japanese offensive designed to conclude the Chinese Theater once and for all as the Japanese continued to press Ichigo the Chinese joined the multinational Burma campaign an epic series of battles and sieges that ended with the country liberated and the Burma Road opened once more the fighting in Burma would carry China through the end of the war and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki surrendered as the Soviets invaded Manchuria but the guns did not fall silent in the Middle Kingdom the corpse of Japanese imperialism was hardly cold before the kuomintang and CCP were once again at each other's throats China was devastated by prolonged war with infrastructure ruined political division at an all-time high and millions of refugees left without homes figures vary wildly on the total number of Chinese troops and civilians who lost their lives from 1937 to 1945 but all agreed that the figure lies in the tens of millions tragically however the Chinese Civil War was yet to be resolved [Music]\",\n",
       " \" [Music] from widespread destruction to one of the largest Refugee crises in the world consequences of the war in Ukraine have reverberated globally today we're going to delve into the 2022 events from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian and this is the war in Ukraine 2022. our historical strategy game fire and maneuver has left early access and is available now check it out with the link below in order to understand the origins of the war it is crucial to examine the events that triggered the Ukrainian Russian crisis starting with the annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of hostilities in donbass Y in early 2014 the euromaiden protests led to the ousting of Ukraine's pro-ruption president Victor Yanukovych soon after Yanukovych fled to Russia a wave of pro-russian unrest erupted in eastern and southern Ukraine simultaneously unmarked Russian troops which had already been stationed in military bases within Crimea took control of government buildings strategic sites and infrastructure in March Moscow would hold a highly contentious referendum which led to Crimea being annexed by Russia the results of this referendum were not recognized by the International Community soon after armed pro-russian separatists seized government buildings in donpass and proclaimed the Donetsk and luhansk people's republics the separatists received considerable covert support from Russia and Ukrainian attempts to fully retake the separatist-held areas were unsuccessful the fighting would continue in 2015 especially around Donetsk luhansk and mariopol with the separatists intent on gaining control of the oblasts still the front lines would soon become largely static as a result in February 2015 Russia and Ukraine signed the Minsk II agreements in a bid to end the conflict although the agreements were never fully implemented the donbass War settled into a violent but effectively Frozen conflict with many brief ceasefires no lasting peace and few changes in territorial control a major escalation would happen three years later as the Russian coast guard fired upon and captured three Ukrainian Navy vessels after they attempted to Transit from the Black Sea into the sea of azov the Kirch Strait incident flared up tensions and martial law was briefly declared by Ukraine in fears that a full-scale war would soon break out between the two countries but new conflict did not come nevertheless as soon as Crimea was annexed Moscow had begun to integrate the regions under their control issuing hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to Ukrainian citizens this violent status quo continued for years until the beginning of 2021 when Russia built up a large military presence near its border with Ukraine including from neighboring Belarus the Kremlin denied any ill will regarding these troop concentrations stating that they were in the area to perform military exercises nonetheless Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of infringing on the rights of Russian speakers and used Ukrainian collaboration with the Germans in the second world war to accuse some in the Kiev government of supporting neo-nazis Putin argued that Ukraine never had a tradition of genuine statehood rather that Lenin had created it by carving a Soviet Republic out of Russian imperial land and that Stalin and Khrushchev expanded Ukraine after the second world war Putin continued to criticize the enlargement of NATO publicly and demanded that Ukraine be barred from ever joining alongside this he also demanded the removal of multinational forces stationed in NATO's Eastern European member states these demands were rejected by NATO and Ukraine under U.S influence continues to seek more

peacekeeping mission in response Ukrainian President vlodimir zielenski ordered a 30-day Nationwide state of emergency and the mobilization of all reservists on the morning of February 24th Putin announced a special military operation to demilitarize anti-notsify Ukraine minutes later air and missile strikes were conducted across the country this was followed shortly thereafter by a large ground Invasion along multiple fronts zelenski declared martial law and a general mobilization of all male Ukrainian citizens between 18 and 60 who were banned from leaving the country Russian attacks were initially launched on a northern front from Belarus toward Kiev a Northeastern front toward kharkiv a southern front from Crimea and a Southeastern front from donbass many expected The Invasion to be a short Affair that would go in Russia's favor with even the Americans offering zelinski evacuation but the ukrainians resisted the northern front which was supposed to be a dash to Kiev to topple the government stalled after initial gains a daring Airborne assault to capture the Antonov airport also failed after the damaging of the ensuing battle which the Russians won rendered the airport inoperable the Russians would be halted at the suburbs of Kiev during the month-long battles of irpin pastomo and bucha Russian logistical issues were evidently seen as their columns stretched four kilometers in a traffic jam the Ukrainian military quickly took advantage of this vulnerability ambushing Russian vehicles and further worsening their supply situation by April Russian command had realized that their offensive had run out of steam and decided to withdraw from the Kiev front to redeploy elsewhere ukrainians lay discovered that a number of civilians were executed in bucha when Russian forces left the area Russian fortunes were different in the South with the recapture of the north Crimean Canal on The Day The Invasion started the canal which had previously supplied 85 percent of crimea's drinking and irrigation water was blocked by Ukraine after its Russian annexation as such its capture represented an important objective for Moscow two days later the siege of mariopol began as the Russian army linked East with the separatists held Don bass Russian forces would also alarm the International Community by attacking the zaparesia nuclear power plant stoking fears of a potential nuclear catastrophe at the time of making this video the power plant remains under Russian control Russian troops would also attack from Crimea toward the west with many theorizing that Russia wanted to push to Odessa and link up with the pro-russian separatist region of transnistria in Moldova it was on this front that the first major Ukrainian city kirsan fell to the Russian army the fall of kerasan was accompanied by the capture of antonovsky bridge holding this strategic crossing over the danipa river would allow Russian forces to attack the important Junction City of mikolai the Russians attempted to take this city but were repelled stopping their Advance toward Odessa in the East the Russian army attempted to capture Ukraine's second largest city car cave while kharkif is less than 35 kilometers from the Russian border the ukrainians put up strong resistance subsequently the city was continuously bombarded and shelled as Russian forces tried to surround the city although they had some success especially toward the southeast with the taking of isium the Russian push toward kharkif ultimately petered out amid the heightened shelling of kharkiv on March 31st a helicopter strike took place against an oil Supply Depot inside Russia in the city of Belgard noteworthy as it happened on the other side of the border the Kremlin was quick to blame Kiev while Ukraine denied responsibility advance from the donbass was slower in comparison to the other fronts as the region had already been the setting of battles since 2014. as a result Ukrainian troops there were already well entrenched meanwhile the siege of mariopol was underway the battle included troops from the regular Russian army as well as the Donetsk People's Republic

toll was likely higher the U.N also reported that 90 of the city's residential buildings had been damaged or destroyed the city's Defenders were eventually cornered into the azov stall steelworks a

continue to Shell the steel works with heavy airstrikes on the 27th and 28th of April the humanitarian crisis in the city was becoming increasingly dire and after a visit by the U.N security General to Moscow the United Nations and the Red Cross started to run evacuations throughout a humanitarian corridor many civilians were still trapped in these steel Works although they would continue to be pulled out during the following Days by May 7th the Ukrainian government reported that all of these civilians in the steel plant had been evacuated with many heavily injured and low on ammunition food and supplies the remaining Defenders surrendered by the 20th six days later Russia reopened the port of mariopol to commercial vessels following mine removal with Ukraine being a major producer of wheat the taking blockading and Mining of its Black Sea ports had serious Global repercussions with increased wheat prices and the threat of famine especially in the Middle East as a result the Black

even more pronounced once the Ukrainian Navy scuttled its Flagship the frigate hetman sahayadetny despite this Ukraine managed to somewhat even the odds by sinking the muskva with two Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles however the Kremlin denies this claiming that it was a munition explosion caused by a fire eventually Moscow and Kiev would reach an agreement brokered by the UN and turkey aiming to resume grain exports for the retreat from Kiev the Russian military concentrated their efforts on the south and the East although they managed some advances the Ukrainian military managed to hold the line for the most part on the 6th of September prompted by the wave of military aid from the West Ukraine launched a surprise counter-offensive in kharkiv which successfully cleared the surrounding areas and eliminated any risk of losing the city 15 days later Putin announced partial mobilization which was followed by an exodus of young Russian men from the country in late September Moscow would organize referendums in the Donetsk Kirsten luhansk and zaparitia oblasts and hurriedly proclaimed their annexations to the Russian Federation these oblasts were not completely occupied by Russian forces and the majority of the International Community do not recognize the claims of the annexation at the same time the Ukrainian military was conducting an offensive in the South although it would take them months the ukrainians managed to disrupt Russian supply lines to the point that it made their positions on the Western Bank of the denaper untenable this was worsened by an attack on the Kirch Strait Bridge which was a crucial supply line after repeated attacks and being forced back the Russian military decided to retreat from the provincial capital back to the Eastern Bank successfully completing an orderly withdrawal in the wake of the success of the kirison offensive the war had shifted back to the donbass where Wagner group mercenaries have been involved in

there are few depictions as iconic as the Japanese Samurai since their rise in the late 11th century the samurai grew into an influential social cast and were given extraordinary powers such as the privilege to openly wear swords in public or the right to strike with their swords at any one of a lower class who compromised their honor or the honor of their Lord with such power they were thought

a prolonged era of peace and isolation from the outer world the mid-19th century saw the status of the Samurai beginning to decline the absence of War left many Samurai divorced from their core duties as Bushi Warriors enforcing the rule of their Lords known as daimyo with few roles to spare many were forced to move away from military duties and fulfill their feudal obligations through Civil Service the overabundance of Samurai also affected their Financial Security forcing many to sell prized possessions or land and in some cases find other forms of employment these struggles facing many Samurai weren't just internal with increased activity from westerners in East Asia the power and wealth of these nanban soon threatened the delicate balance of Japanese Society for nearly two and a half centuries the Tokugawa shoguns had confined Europeans to the trading Outpost of dejima but this status quo was squashed with the arrival of U.S Commodore Matthew Perry who positioned American warships throughout Edo Bay in 1853 the appearance of his Black Ships so close to Edo brought Panic to the shogunate's leadership yet for the samurai reactions were mixed as it became clear that the hegemony of the Tokugawa was coming to an end foreign [Music] as the shogunet's position weakened within Japan the late 1850s to mid-1860s gave rise to a movement aimed at dismantling the shogun's power in the central government this anti-shockenet group was led by a low-ranking but influential Samurai named Sakamoto Yoma of the tosa domain using sakamoto's connections the movement bought weapons and a steamship from a British Merchant in Nagasaki in 1866 a young mutsuhito took the throne as Emperor Meiji meanwhile the shogunet sought to strengthen their rule with French military assistance but were too late as the Satsuma domain threw in their lot with the new emperor and decided to overthrow the shogunate by force to do this they cited a secret Imperial edict which claimed to legitimize their actions but the edict itself bore no real signatures or authorization to all appearances it was a dubious document yet the battle lines were drawn and Samurai found themselves serving on both sides of the conflict given the feudal nature of Samurai there were distinctions between those serving under the imperialist forces of the emperor and those serving under the shogunate with the imperialists many Samurai were included in 60-man drafts given to the emperor by his new subordinate Warlords but during this time the Imperial forces were also bolstered by a new westernized military force the shogunate's forces were more varied with itsu domain providing the bulk of military support in the form of traditional Warriors categorized by age along with these the Shoguns troops were also bolstered by the ultra loyalist Shinsengumi and the elite denshutai corps following a number of resolutions in the emperor's Court aimed at destabilizing the shogunate an alarmed Tokugawa yoshinobu ordered his forces to March towards Kyoto however before the shogunet's forces could arrive they were intercepted by Imperial forces around the outskirts of the city culminating in the Battle of Toba Fushimi here Imperial forces repulsed the shogun's Army and later moved towards Edo capturing it by late May to July 1868 in the Battle of koshu katsunuma with the fall of Edo the shogunate was all but destroyed and the city was renamed to Tokyo becoming Japan's new imperial capital to the relief of many Samurai who threw in with the Shogun this new government took over as administrators without exacting revenge on those who supported Tokugawa who by this time had been allowed to leave Edo and sequester himself in the ancestral Retreat of shizwoka thank you following the bhoshin war Japan made Headway into becoming a fully centralized State the country was brought under unified control and opened to foreign influence which came mostly in Western trade and Industry Emperor meiji's government reformed and modernized Japan's institutions along with its infrastructure this included the establishment of a modern Railway system and a substantial overhaul of the Japanese military with this progress came resistance however as the westernization of Japan's Armed Forces was not a welcome reform for many Samurai as it resulted in the loss of traditional Privileges and stipends this forced many into poverty and discontent with the new government one of the Samurai affected by this regime included the legendary saigo takamori of Satsuma a loyal imperialist and hero of the bhoshin war takamori had become a powerful member of the new ruling class and had initially tolerated meiji's reforms however he later resigned from government over disputes about a military expedition to Korea which he saw as an opportunity for Samurai to maintain their Prestige as Bushi in service to their feudal Lords in 1876 saigo takamori was persuaded into leading a 15 000 strong Rebellion against the new government these Rebels expressed dissatisfaction with the government's economic plans the treatment of former Samurai and the perceived loss of Traditional Values in response government forces mustered their newly standardized Imperial Army against him in the winter of 1876 to 1877 saigo's Advance on Tokyo was hindered by severe snowfall forcing him to strike out against the imperialists the Rebels first attacked the castle of Kumamoto in February 1877 expecting Little Resistance from the outnumbered Garrison which consisted mostly of conscripts these soldiers surprised the rebel Army however fending them off before the arrival of Imperial reinforcements at the castle for the next few months saigo's Rebels were steadily driven back engaging in a guerrilla campaign against the larger and better equipped Imperial Army eventually with their numbers dwindling and supplies running low takamori and his remaining troops made a final stand on Mount enodake in August 1877. the rebellion was defeated and saigo himself died in the final battle of shiroyama above the city of kagoshima the Meiji government was able to suppress the Rebellion but it was a costly Affair both in terms of lives lost and the damage to the country's infrastructure for those few Samurai who looked to retain their Prestige and traditions however because it was much higher foreign [Music] with the Rebellion crushed all vestiges of feudal influence in the government withered away Imperial power only grew as the Meiji regime became more centralized and for those Samurai who remained loyal to the emperor many of their former privileges had begun to vanish however despite the loss of their feudal privileges many of the Meiji Elite that dominated politics military leadership and industrialism were drawn from the samurai class figures such as Ido hirabumi and itagaki taisuke were loyal supporters of the emperor and held key positions of power ultimately as the Imperial Army completed its modernization the samurai were abolished as a social class which is best exemplified in 1876 when the wearing of Swords was finally forbidden to all except members of the Armed Forces with this image we see the once Noble Samurai dressed now in the habit of a western gentleman as he hangs up his old swords for good the era of the feudal Warrior

right now the speed and effectiveness of Nazi Germany's new war machine was demonstrated for the first time in full during their 1939 invasion of Poland in planning for the invasion one of the main concerns of Hitler and German High command the okw was the looming threat of France on their western border dividing their forces and engaging in a two-front war was out of the question so German planners concluded that they could only hope to win by destroying the Polish Army as rapidly as possible before turning all of their attention West to achieve this the okw relied on the Prussian strategy of decisive maneuver which aimed for Rapid surprise attacks followed by encirclements of retreating enemies this proven tactic was supported by new ideas about mechanized Warfare developed During the interwar period most importantly the concept of the Panzer Division While most armies at the time employed tanks primarily as support for their infantry the Vermont concentrated their armored units into separate divisions and placed them front and center in their operations the doctrines surrounding the use of these Panzer divisions as fast-moving armored spearheads would later form the strategy that we now call Blitzkrieg but at the time it was less of a distinct idea and more of a continuation of a tried and true Prussian Doctrine while armored units were very effective during the invasion of Poland punching through Enemy Lines with the help of infantry and luftwaffe dive bombers their presence was far from the decisive factor in the campaign's success out of the 53 divisions in the German invasion Force only six were Panzer divisions while another four were motorized the vast majority of the fighting in Poland was done by conventional infantry with horses playing an important role rather than widespread mechanization or brilliant tactics the Vermont's greatest advantage in its first campaign was arguably the Strategic weakness of the Polish Army diplomatic meddling and false promise from their Western allies had interfered with their mobilization leaving polish forces deployed in a thin line too close to their long border with Germany and Slovakia this left the poles especially vulnerable to flanking and encirclement and by the time the Soviets invaded from the East the fate of Poland was sealed in less than a month the Polish military had been crushed between the armies of Germany and the Soviet Union and the government had been forced into exile in April of the following year the Germans set their sights on Denmark and Norway in order to deny the British access to the Baltic secure their iron ore Supply from neutral Sweden and gain access to Norwegian heavy water facilities the invasion of Denmark was met with almost no resistance and was over in less than six hours making it by far the fastest campaign Germany would ever complete Norway did not fare much better while the Panzer divisions played a relatively minor part in a Polish campaign the invasion of Norway would see these new armored tactics take on a very different role specifically a non-existent one as the campaign did not involve any armored units instead the conquest of Norway was accomplished through an amphibious assault utilizing Naval Air air airborne and ground forces in a coordinated well-timed surprise attack to minimize their disadvantages against the Royal Navy the Germans planned the operation during April when harsh weather on the North Sea would hinder enemy ships and reduce visibility giving their Invasion forces a better chance to safely reach their targets as the kriegs marina held off the Royal Navy at Sea infantry units captured several key ports while paratroopers were deployed to Sea's key airfields this sudden and decisive attack caught the Norwegians and their allies off guard although it would be two months before the Norwegian Army would capitulate the nation's capital and most of its major cities fell to the German's amphibious Invasion within the first 24 hours the invasion of Norway was not the only important role that the kriegs marina played during the first two years of the war although Germany was blockaded immediately after the war started the Germans also simultaneously began their Convoy raiding campaign u30 for example sank the British ocean liner SS Athena mere hours after the war declaration the British soon adopted the convoy system and formed anti-submarine hunting groups based around aircraft carriers this would soon backfire as the HMS Arc Royal Britain's modern aircraft carrier was almost sunk two weeks after the war declaration and another British carrier the HMS courageous would actually be sunk three days later German submarines would even infiltrate the British base at scapa flow and sink a battleship the HMS Royal Oak with the adoption of wolf pack tactics the U-Boat Fleet had immense success sinking millions of tons of shipping even surface Raiders like the Admiral hipper and the Admiral Shearer had success attacking British convoys this period of early success would be nicknamed The Happy Time by German sailors a month after the invasion of Norway the Germans finally ended the eight-month phony War by launching their Western offensive into the Benelux and France the German plan relied heavily on fast-moving armored and motorized units to exploit weakness in the Allied defenses on May 10th the German Army launched a surprise attack on the neutral countries of the Benelux overwhelming Force combined with daring Airborne assaults quickly managed to break the back of the Dutch Army while the belgians supported by both France and Britain buckled in the face of Hitler's finest Panzer formations rather than attacking the enemy head-on fast-moving German units outmaneuvered their Allied counterparts to cut off their supply lines and disrupt reinforcements it was these armored spearheads that drove through the ardenne avoiding the imagino line and encircling the British expeditionary forces around Dunkirk the British were only spared from Disaster by a daring evacuation with the close support of the luftwaffe the invading forces were able to wreak havoc on Allied Logistics with devastating results the Germans also took advantage of the fact that the French deployed their tanks evenly across the front line which allowed them to mask their panzers into concentrated attacks a great number of France's dreaded Char B1 battle tanks in many ways Superior to contemporary German tanks wound up being abandoned across the battlefield after running out of fuel with their impressive armor barely scratched German Logistics on the other hand functioned very smoothly with a report from Panzer group kleist asserting that there was not a single Supply crisis that his group was unable to resolve this was in large part thanks to France's infrastructure which included a large quantity of gas stations the steady supply of fuel allowed the Panzer divisions to race ahead and attempt the far-ranging encirclement Maneuvers that would ultimately play a major role in the rapid destruction of the French army the stable supply lines the Germans enjoyed during the Western offensive were absolutely critical for continuing their fast-paced armored Maneuvers without them the Germans rapid advances could not be sustained after Dunkirk it only took the Germans three more weeks to conquer the rest of France the fall of France also had the added benefit of providing the Germans with Atlantic Naval bases which would contribute to the success of their U-Boat fleets meanwhile the Germans would establish the Vichy French government in the South the incredible success of the French campaign cemented a popular image of the Vermont as an Unstoppable machine capable of rolling over its enemies with overwhelming speed and strength even the German leadership was largely taken in by the notion of their invincibility despite the fact that it was blatantly false fascists in Italy looked on with envy and trepidation Mussolini feared being sidelined by Hitler and thus had thrust his forces into the Battle of France leading to war with the British Empire December of 1940 would see the Italians spectacularly fail on the field losing three ships at Toronto and swaths of Italian Libya to the British by February 1941. compounding these losses in the desert were Italian defeats in the Balkans where IL duche's half-baked invasion of Greece had turned into a route of Epic Proportions with the Greeks not only pushing the Italians out of their country but following them into Italian occupied Albania the British soon allied with the ascendant Greeks and the Italians found themselves brutalized by the Tommy's on one side and the hellenics on the other Italy's attempts at Conquest had turned into a dumpster fire and Hitler feared The Blaze would spread his worry exploded into outright Fury when Yugoslavia reluctantly joined the Axis powers only to implode into an anti-fascist coup that the fearer took as a personal affront rolling up their sleeves and dragging the Italians and hungarians along with them the Germans swept into Yugoslavia in a blowout Invasion subjugating the Rogue axis Ally in less than a month meanwhile other German troops trudged into Greece bailing out the beleaguered Italians and conquering the entire country the British sent an expeditionary Force to shore up the Greek defense but even their combined strength couldn't stand up to the Nazi counter-attack and its Italian Hangers On the Allies withdrew to Crete trying to make the island a Mediterranean stronghold but the German falshem Yeager cracked the defense on May 20th 1941 in a historic butyric Victory the German Triumph at Crete was a costly Affair to the point that General Kurt student who commanded the falsham Yeagers would dub Crete the graveyard of the German paratroopers Germany had well and truly saved Italy's panchetta but even as the dust of battle settled there were some in Germany who questioned the wisdom of coming to Mussolini's rescue Lenny Riefenstahl the Nazi propagandist influential filmmaker and close friend of Hitler recalled the fuhrer stewing over the possibility that if the Italians hadn't attacked Greece and needed our help the war would have taken a different course we could have anticipated the Russian cold by weeks and conquered Leningrad and Moscow there could have been no Stalingrad Hitler's assessment of operation Barbarossa is disputed by modern historians Richard Hooker Jr a U.S army analyst argues that the delayed timetable did not prevent the troops from advancing to Moscow between late June and mid-august especially given their morale was at an all-time high following the victories in Yugoslavia and Greece David glance a military history Professor believes that Germany's Balkan campaign actually helped Barbarossa by discrediting Soviet intelligence reports of an imminent Invasion however the popular belief is that Germany's support of Italy hindered Barbarossa resulting in the first of many defeats for the Third Reich the answer to this eternal question may never be found lost in the fog of History Operation Barbarossa initially lived up to its promise The Joint Invasion by Nazi Germany and Italy with support from Romania Hungary and Finland saw the axis make their typical quick gains and seize much territory even as Hitler constantly changed their strategic goals but the invasion hit a major stumbling block at the first battle of Smolensk which left the triumphant Army group Center severely debilitated High command elected to order the center to hold and diverted other forces to reinforce the push into Ukraine and against Leningrad Kiev would soon fall and the axis spent the ensuing months fighting their way to Victory across the USSR except for the grinding sieges at Leningrad and sevastopol buoyed by their success the axis made a rush for Moscow only to grind to a halt just outside the capital suburbs burned out from their rapid Advance bloodied by dogged Soviet resistance and with these Soviets gearing up for a counter-offensive the axis could do nothing but wait for the Communists response a response that would throw the Germans back from Moscow even as they held on to their other conquests but as the Germans licked their wounds a new foe was brought into the war the bombing of Pearl Harbor saw the United States declare war on the Empire of Japan and honoring its treaty obligations Nazi Germany declared war on the U.S soon thereafter Germany was well and truly being pushed closer and closer to the edge due to the logistical issues mostly lack of oil the Germans could only focus on one Army group for their 1942 offensive Hitler and his generals began planning for the next phase of their offensive against the Soviet Union aiming South with an eye towards seizing the Reds oil fields during a planning session Hitler grimly informed the commanders of army group South that if I do not get the oil of my cop and grozny then I must end this war their rush into the USSR had well and truly stretched the Germans then and the Nazi summer offensive including the Battle of Stalingrad represented A desperate Hail Mary if the Nazis could capture the Soviet oil fields they could retain the initiative and grind the hated Communists into the Dust but desperation bred under preparedness and the soldiers who marched to capture the oil were neither ready for the mountainous terrain nor equipped for Winter fighting these Soviets proved dogged as ever especially at Stalingrad leading to the Germans being encircled by a Soviet counter-attack that wiped out the sixth Army Army group South was ultimately forced back into Ukraine by the Soviets with the Germans in the Caucasus barely managing an escape during Operation Barbarossa failure led to finger-pointing with General Franz halder the chief of staff blaming the diversion of troops to the Ukraine for the inability to capture Moscow however halder's argument neglected the fact that Napoleon was able to occupy Moscow during his own invasion of Russia and history may have repeated itself had the Vermont reached the city even so this was not a Napoleonic War of Conquest but a war of annihilation these Soviets had to be exterminated their land and resources claimed for Nazi Germany Hitler in many regards picked the worst possible fight he chose to throw his men against a cornered animal with unbelievable reserves of Manpower and Industrial capacity and his men were mauled it is February 1943. the cracks are beginning to show on the Eastern Front The Battle of Stalingrad ending with both the Soviets and Nazis battered but the Soviets can weather the beating the retreat is draining Germany's oil the Soviets are draining Germany's Manpower and the privations of War are draining Germany's hope Yosef gerbils Infamous minister of propaganda and the man who convinced a nation that millions of Innocents just had to die takes to the podium to sell the German people on their words emblazoned on the banners overhead totala Krieg Total War s foreign foreign [Music] all right [Applause] whether the people were willing to follow or not to a taller Krieg wouldn't save the Third Reich the failure of operation fallblau or case blue was a major contributor to the eventual axis defeat on the Eastern front although many will argue that the invasion of the Soviet Union Operation Barbarossa was doomed from the start launched in June of 1942 case blue was an attempt to simultaneously cut off Soviet access to resupply from the Black Sea and capture the oil fields located in the Caucasus the oil wells of Baku were of Paramount importance as Germany had exhausted its pre-war petroleum reserves yet ironically the operation designed to address this shortage only exacerbated it as the marathon drive toward caucasia and the scorched Earth Defense by Soviet forces stretched already fragile fuel lines leaving their offensives in the East all but dead in the water case blue culminated in the Battle of Stalingrad which marked the deepest penetration of Nazi troops into the Soviet Union but although they inflicted Grievous losses on the Red Army the offensive was ultimately turned back along with practically all of the momentum on the Eastern Front Germany went into the Caucasus for oil and Triumph but left with empty tanks and full graveyards as bad as this situation was Nazi officials had reason for some confidence the Allied raid at diap France in August of 1942 was an embarrassing failure and a windfall for the German propaganda Ministry indicating that the Allies lacked the expertise to launch an amphibious invasion of Europe the luftwaffe also regularly inflicted heavy casualties on Allied bomber sorties giving hope that they could still win the war in the air in the long term this optimism was strengthened with the knowledge that cutting-edge jet fighters like the me-262 might enter production within a year but these dreams became increasingly far-fetched as Germany's answer to its logistical challenges was the creation of Evermore complex wunderwaffe or Wonder Weapons that created more of the same challenges V2 rocket systems to Reign holy Terror on petulant londoners stg-44s that would influence modern assault rifles Mouse tanks to grind the judeo Bolsheviks into dust and other incredible inventions that were largely either too expensive ineffective or impractical fuel was a constant concern with the vermashed juggling supplies of petrol and synthetic gas to power its desperate operations far more sinisterly the Germans relied on slave labor from concentration camp inmates who suffered both from the malice of their oppressors as well as industrial accidents all of these issues saw Albert Speer Hitler's armaments Minister and the man with his hands on the levers of German industry playing an Ever more challenging game of the floor is lava economic Edition Fritz Reinhardt state Secretary in the German finance ministry reportedly said the contributions that have been allocated to paying off the interest and principle on the national debt must henceforth be covered by current revenues earned from the economic exploitation of the Eastern territories this economic exploitation one of the many schemes designed to remedy Germany's excessive spending paradoxically worsened the German economic condition in large part because the scheme was falsely predicated on a quick and decisive military conquest but Hitler and his advisors hardly concerned themselves with these practical considerations they had Nazi ideology which elevated the war to an apocalyptic struggle between the superior Aryan race and the untermench who stood between them and the Mastery of Europe early success in Poland and France had taught the Nazi party that shortcomings in strategy or Logistics could be overcome by raw Germanic prowess encouraging blind belief in Nazi Supremacy and downplaying objective analysis of defeats or strategic blunders after all as Hitler said regarding Operation Barbarossa all the Germans had to do was kick the door in and the entire structure would come crashing down that they kept having to find more doors to kick was another matter even after the failure of case blue Hitler tried to keep the Army on an offensive footing but his plans were constantly postponed meanwhile Soviet winter counter-offensives made inroads on nazi-held territory forming a Salient around the city of Kursk with Summer approaching Hitler authorized operation Citadel a massive attack on this Salient by Army group Center and army group South What followed is often considered one of the largest tank battles in history the luftwaffe and Panzer divisions exhausting themselves trying to break through the Soviet defenses and envelop the salient yet this Salient would ultimately hold and operation Citadel represented everything wrong with the German war effort it was a reactionary move based on vague strategic goals that even if successful would merely delay the inevitable after the failure at Kursk the German disposition would permanently shift to the defensive even so German morale endured the disaster at Kursk and the vermacht remained an effective fighting force throughout 1943. this was primarily due to the efforts of men like Walter modal and Albert kesselring who effectively transitioned the German Army to a defensive posture hopes rested on a series of fortifications constructed along the dinap river sometimes known as the OST wall despite hurling up to 3 million Soviet soldiers at the OST wall in August the Red Army was unable to cross the denipper for nearly three months meanwhile in the west the Allied invasion of Italy was brought to a standstill at the Gustav line in December as winter set in Hitler hoped that Germany could hold out until the Unholy alliance between the capitalist Western allies and the Communist USSR collapsed under its own ideological weight unfortunately for Germany reality finally came knocking on Hitler's door in June of 1944. it's my food kind of moment foreign [Music] s did not take the Germans completely by surprise on the contrary the highest echelons of German command were well aware that an invasion was imminent and of the least possible threat the furor was confident that the Atlantic Wall stretching from the border of Spain to Norway would not only repulse any Allied Landing but caused so many Commonwealth and American casualties that the Western allies would lose their capacity to continue the war for its buyer line a senior aide to Irwin Rommel in Africa and later commander of the Panzer Lair division at Normandy held the debacle at the app up as incontrovertible proof the Allies could not manage an amphibious assault the series of successful Allied amphibious Landings in Italy gave even Hitler pause however and he placed Rommel in charge of Shoring up the defenses along the English Channel rommel's task was an inevitable one concrete was at a premium with the Lion's Share of Germany's Supply going to the construction of hardened U-Boat shelters per Hitler's direct orders French laborers and Italian pows were conscripted to improve the defenses turrets from captured French tanks were made into makeshift emplacements named to Brooks after a jury-rigged reinforced firing pit Italian soldiers had built with buried cement pipes in North Africa and extensive minefields were laid perhaps rommel's most ingenious inventions were the Rommel spargle or rommel's asparagus webs of metal wire strung along fields of short poles meant to shred gliders as they tried to land alongside anti-ship mines placed into the beaches atop angled poles driven into the sand but static defenses were only part of rommel's strategy Hitler and the high command had become convinced the Allies would land at the easy to reach podik lay operatives confirmed this loudly and often falling for the Allied deception operation Operation Fortitude Rommel for his part began to shift his view toward an Allied landing at Normandy the beaches were similar to the Italian Shore and the Allies would want to maximize their chances of success by striking on familiar ground regardless of where the Allies came Rommel argued that the only way to beat them back was through defensive action on the beaches meeting the Allies as they landed and denying them the opportunity to take even a centimeter of ground given the equality of the troops defending Normandy this was Far easier planned than executed Normandy was the responsibility of the seventh Army whose units in the area were to put it mildly of mixed quality promising recruits were siphoned off by SS falshem Yeager or Panzer recruiters leaving a contingent of unfit or unremarkable men Among The Defenders of Normandy were the so-called ear and stomach battalions composed of soldiers convalescing from combat wounds to their abdomens or who were experiencing hearing loss and ostrupen foreign auxiliaries from conquered lands forced to fight for the Reich including many Soviet pows naturally most proved highly ineffective with many deserting to join the French Resistance or surrendering to the Allies at the first opportunity the few capable soldiers either suffered from endemic fatalism such as Captain Eberhard vigamon of the 21st Panzer Division who commented we were well aware that neither are men nor our tanks were good enough or were almost fanatically prepared to meet their foes this attitude was usually convinced by the younger SS troops thank you as June 5th crapped into June 6th the kriegs marina pulled patrols from the English Channel German meteorologists had declared the weather unsuitable for an invasion through June 10th there was scientifically speaking no chance of a landing Rommel took these assurances as an opportunity to go on leave returning to Germany to celebrate his wife's birthday and arrange an audience with Hitler to request additional panzers along the wall Friedrich dolman commander of the seventh Army ordered a command post drill for his officers on June 6th the evening was shaping up to be a quiet Affair and the Germans began preparing for the next day's routine until Allied bombs began falling this itself was not unusual as the Allies had launched near continuous runs against the Germans for some time but this raid was an overture to Operation Overlord as centuries fought off sleep gliders began to make silent Landings as officers crawled into bed paratroopers began to descend to Earth bewildered German commanders found enemies literally raining down on their heads and desperately rang to their superiors or assembled cells of ad hoc resistance Lieutenant General Joseph Reichert commander of the 711th Infantry Division recalled a night of drinking in the officer's mess ending in combat the inebriated officer pistol in hand stumbled out into the night to find British paratroopers raining down on the 711th command post Riker and his men were able to fend off the assault and these still drunk General desperately rang to his superiors to announce the beginning of the Allied invasion in the American Landing zones Lieutenant General Wilhelm Foley commander of the 91st luftwanda division was ambushed and killed by the 82nd Airborne just behind his headquarters near soulman igle other Germans proved less willing to give battle Reiner hartmatz a soldier serving near Normandy rushed to his command post to find his officers gripped by battle shock two men were simply catatonic while Reiner's company Commander was sprawled drunkenly in a foxhole every time a runner brought news from the front line the commander would idly threaten to execute anyone who returned to the scene of the action as Dawn began to light up the Normandy Coast the Germans were shocked to see an Allied Armada steaming toward them with no Naval forces to challenge them the Allied landing craft and their escorts took up their positions in the English Channel and that's when the shells began Landing [Music] thank you the opening bombardment of Omaha Beach caught German Shore batteries in the middle of preparing Ford Gunnery practice turning what should have been a morning of plinking in the Atlantic into a Scramble for survival weathering this bombardment was the 716th static Infantry Division a unit of notoriously low quality composed of decrepit or boyish conscripts and ill-motivated OST troopan the division was denied the usual allotment of artillery and heavy Vehicles their peers in the Army enjoyed relying on a hodgepodge of German armaments and foreign heavy weapons but the 716th was not alone at Omaha as other areas were defended by the much more powerful 352nd Infantry Division as battle was joined on the beach and American servicemen scrambled for cover machine gunner Heinrich zavalo of the 352nd could see the water spouts where my machine gun bursts were hitting and when the little fountains got close to the gis they threw themselves down they lay in the shallow water many tried to get to the most forward Beach obstacles to find some cover behind them I fired some more at the many dark Foams in the water zavalo senior one Lieutenant freerking pitied the Americans as poor swine even as he called more artillery strikes onto the floundering Infantry all over the beach zavalo could see wounded moving around on the bloody watery slime mostly creeping trying to get to the upper Beach and find some cover behind the shingle embankment one by one they would occasionally run in a Crouch as the day went on men like xavolo and their heavy Weaponry would make Omaha the deadliest landing on D-Day [Music] the 716th division at sword Beach was a sorry Affair the overstretched Germans were severely lacking in air support or completed fortifications and had utterly failed to coordinate with Coastal artillery in their sector the area teamed with vacation homes and Coastal settlements and saved for summon placements in the sand dunes and a handful of beach obstacles was largely undeveloped the individual soldiers were also of low quality with Lieutenant Carl Haida bemoaning the condition of his divisions officers many had been severely wounded previously some became unpleasant or socially inept due to their early harsh War experiences I will not deny that some did get drunk at times Lieutenant Schoff of the 716th noted that the rank and file were overworked and ill-motivated too busy putting up wire and planting rommel's asparagus to have much time for training indeed the mix of Germans and ostrupen defending sword Beach routinely convinced a lack of care as artilleryman Hans glaub describes his fellow Gunners failing to keep their pieces clean sword would prove to be a relatively smooth Landing with the Germans yielding the beach two British forces with minimum casualties their attitude would change when they met the more professional soldiers of the 21st Panzer Division launching a two-pronged counter-attack to the east and west of sword however major Hans Von Luke commander of the Eastern thrust wrote in his Memoir Panzer commander of attempting to lead the second Battalion of the 21st against Doug in British paratroopers only to be stymied by Allied aircraft and Naval fire the German defense at Utah Beach was compromised by the Airborne operations cut phone lines had crippled their ability to exchange information while the spread out Landing zones made mounting a large-scale defense difficult Utah and its environs were defended primarily by the 709th Infantry Division made up of older Germans and the ever ubiquitous ostrupen armed with a bizarre mix of weapons French German polish even Russian armaments filled their stores but blessed with competent leadership at least Lieutenant General Carl Wilhelm Graf Von schleiben overall commander of the 709th would order an actual organized counter-attack in the face of the Airborne assault arranging for the 100th Panzer Battalion to drive forward to meet the 82nd Airborne at salmer iglei and at their critical Bridgehead over the ameriday the 100th would be driven back by the 82nd in spectacular fashion as the obsolete French tanks they deployed against the Americans were annihilated with Bazookas and Gammon grenades but the 82nd were not the only paratroopers in the area the sixth paratroop regiment under the command of major Fon der haita pushed out of karata to reinforce their ground-based colleagues as they came upon the Americans Landing zones the Germans were astonished at the number of parachutes Left Behind yards and yards of silk littered the fields of france the fall shimmy anger would push onto the commune Dumont where haita climbed the church steeple and saw the endless Armada in the channel thank you things were not much better for the Germans on the beach proper Lieutenant Arthur Yanka commanded Fort W5 a network of bunkers and pillboxes built into the dunes over the beaches which was all but destroyed by the morning bombings Yanko recalled how the raids obliterated his position Avalanches of sand and concrete buried his men alive forcing them to be dug out even as the assault on the beaches began spotting the American landing craft Yanka ordered what men he could rally to dig in and ordered a dispatch Rider to make for the nearest artillery battery to Shell the beach Bianca's Rider would be intercepted by American paratroopers there was little Yanka and his men could do as The Landings began in Ernst with men and floating tanks fighting their way through the surf and straight toward the ruins of W5 a blast knocked Yonka to the ground and as his eyes fought to focus and the ringing in his ears subsided he looked up through his skewed spectacles to see an American infantryman standing over him as combat intensified on Normandy and reports of paratroopers and an Allied Fleet flooded High command the general staff thought to themselves this is all an elaborate ruse the general staff passed this thought around as Hitler slept in as more and more Allied troops and heavy equipment began making their way onto the beaches Hitler finally rolled out of bed to be met with word of the invasion of France the fuhrer could not have been happier Hitler declared again that the Atlantic Wall would throw the Allies back and he eagerly anticipated following up the inevitable failure of the Normandy Landings by reigning V-1 bombs on London the Western armies would be ground into the Sands of France and the seat of his hated British enemies would be blown to Smithereens by Superior German weaponry but as the day dragged on and the Allies began to gain ground the Frontline Commander's flooded High command with requests for support requests to do something to prevent their positions from being overrun the beacons of Normandy were lit but High command would not answer the call for Aid Hitler the only man on Earth who could release the panzers would continue to insist that the Allies could and should be thrown back on the shore this thinking had managed to seep into some of the Defenders on Gold Beach Friedrich verster helped crew a battery of four captured Czech cannons at Marie fonten near the beach verster firmly agreed with his fuhrer that the Atlantic Wall was impenetrable an attitude he kept right up until the British overran his Commander's spotting position near the shore in the face of Allied superiority in men and materiel verster and his fellows quietly surrendered further behind the lines the Germans were hard at work trying to Corral the French civilian population propaganda Vans drove through Kong ordering the population to remain indoors while the German authorities began to arrange for the evacuation of key parts of the city at Von roonshed's headquarters outside of Paris telephones rang continuously and teletypes spewed seemingly infinite messages combat at Gold Beach began in Ernst when the first landing craft dropped their ramps the moment the medal hit the surf German machine guns and artillery opened up on the British troops who fought hard to clear the beach and sweep the Fortified Coastal houses the Germans had worked into their defenses indeed the Germans put up a fierce fight at gold with elements of the 352nd Infantry reigning fire on the British from a cliff top over the beach at Amel including devastating volleys from Aflac 88. the British were only able to unseat the Germans at Amel with tank support including a mortar armed member of hobart's funnies elements of the 12th SS division spotted The Invasion Fleet anchored off of Juno Beach in the early morning hours Lieutenant Peter hansman of the 12th recalled being awoken by his NCO in charge shaking my shoulders herloin onto the invasion has started Huntsman rushed to a vantage point near Gold Beach looking through my binoculars I recognized the individual outlines of ships at irregular intervals flashes of ship's artillery were coming from various spots fast boats with high white foamy bowel waves were spitting out brown clumps of men on the beach the lieutenant counted over 400 ships in the channel from his front row seat to the end of the Third Reich I wanted to shout at all the generals right up to Adolf Hitler over here quickly before it's too late whoever can still fight come here the fastest most powerful divisions send them here the luftwaffa where is it the kriegs marina where is it it must get here Grenadier Hans weiner who defended a position on Juno dubbed wn-31 recalled watching the first Tommy's jumping into the sea which was quite shallow the bullets hit them and their boats to good effect and I was a little surprised to see them falling I don't know why ner's position was eventually torn apart by the tanks coming ashore with the Canadians which managed to drive Inland under the barrel of 88 millimeter cannons poised to shred them as they emerged from the surf 88 millimeter Gunner Heinrich zebel complained of not being able to see many tanks due to the smoke and chaos though his gun claimed at least two Allied tanks before their Block House 2 was blown apart the Germans provided a much tougher obstacle for their foes at the tyville Chateau roughly one mile or one and a half kilometers inland tyville was supposed to be the starting point for a second line of defensive Works laid out by Rommel before the Allied Landings came it was a well-built strong point with a full communication and command complex and underground tunnels connecting it to to Brook turrets armed with machine guns cannons and mortars The Defenders managed to hold the Allies back until nearly 6 PM that day with their final message before the position was taken reading hand-to-hand fighting inside the command post hemmed into a closely confined area but still holding out Heil Hitler not long after the fall of tyville the Canadians began making their way toward the luftwaffe Airfield at copycat one of their key objectives the commandant of the Airfield ordered an evacuation inciting panic in his ground Crews the Germans Made A hurried attempt to destroy the aircraft before they evacuated but their haste proved fatal attempts to raise the Airfield left most of the taxiing area of the runway untouched the takeoff Runway was damaged but not sufficiently to render it unusable and the vast majority of the Field's fuel stores were salvageable in this one case haste ended up lessening waste while operation by gratian in the East shattered the German's Precious Battle lines at the cost of around 400 000 men with Germany's forces being ground to a pulp by these Soviets Romania and Bulgaria defected in 1944 and the panicked Germans occupied Hungary to prevent their defection even as the Hungarian prime minister begged the Soviets for A Separate Peace though German ferocity delayed the Allied Advance they could not match their superiority in men material and air power hemorrhaging Manpower and with hardly any supplies or economic strength remaining the Germans had to get creative to replace their mounting losses in addition to raising 78 Volks Grenadier divisions and moving extant regiments around to create new armies on paper the Germans made a desperate attempt to augment their forces in the form of the volkster or people's storm on October 18 1944 Hitler personally ordered that all civilian males aged 16 to 60 join a new force that would continue to protect the Reich the volksterm was not an organ of the vermasht which Hitler was beginning to see as weak and incompetent but rather a paramilitary militia controlled by the Nazi party Allied intelligence at the time estimated that at full strength the volksterm could have mustered over 13 million fighters to oppose the march to Berlin less than half that number could put up an honest fight the volksterm were initially issued whatever uniforms could be scrounged up but as the logistical situation deteriorated their only standard piece of equipment became a black and red armband identifying them as members of the militia which led to members fighting and everything from civilian business suits to hand-me-down Imperial German kits from the first World War the volksterm were armed with a hodgepodge of Civilian hunting rifles weapons captured from Allied and Scandinavian countries and surprisingly ingenious last-ditch weapons an example of this last category was the eintos Flamin verfer a portable single shot flamethrower the eintos was essentially an oversized aerosol bottle designed to fire a single half-second gout of flame before being discarded in the same vein as the single shot Panzer Faust such a weapon would have been as simple as point and roast making it perfect for civilian users foreign resistance would not end at the front line however Joseph Goebbels launched a massive propaganda push centered around a partisan Network vervolf which would in theory continue the war even in the event of a German defeat people the foolish allies would take for friendly civilians would in fact be hardened Fighters with national socialism burning in their hearts and ready to transform at any moment into a fighting force to sow Discord and strife among the allies Nazi partisans would in reality carry out or take credit for numerous assassinations and sabotage operations during the final years of the war but the massive organization Goebbels wrote about was never a serious threat with wunderwaffa in hand the Germans would win the war Maybe the fuhrer realized that only a grand offensive could now conclude the war for Germany favorably the question was where it stood the best chance of success as action against the Soviets or in Italy would bear little fruit there was however one sector which had historically served a German Army well Hitler no doubt fueled by a sense of 1940 Nostalgia ordered a massive armored attack through the lightly defended Arden region his goal was to drive onto Antwerp and isolate the Commonwealth forces in Holland knocking them out of the war and forcing Britain into another Dunkirk to save what soldiers would be left perhaps even triggering negotiations for peace and freeing up German troops to finally defeat the inferior Soviets in the East Hitler was proven partly right in his predictions when the offensive codenamed operation vasht amrein took the American Defenders by complete surprise causing panic in their lines however in a characteristic display of hubris Hitler and his high command had not only severely underestimated the fighting prowess of the American Army which after the initial shock continued to provide tenacious resistance on key Crossroads and towns all over the Arden but they had also failed to provide their army with enough fuel exhausted and undersupplied The Battered remnants were ultimately ordered to withdraw entirely when a strong Allied counter-attack forced its way through their weakened lines Hitler's final gamble had utterly failed and with it Germany's last military reserves so desperately needed to repel the forthcoming winter offensive on the Eastern Front had been spent Germany's remaining Defenders now had their work cut out for them in January 1945 the Soviets built on the momentum of operation bagration to launch the Vistula odor offensive a crushing drive into Poland that saw Germany lose their first conquest of the war with renowned Field Marshal yorgi zhukov at the head the Soviets obliterated 45 divisions and claimed to have killed or captured 400 000 men stopping at the odor River bordering the Fatherland the propaganda Minister recorded a feeling of utter Terror sweeping through the capital of the Reich as the citizens of Berlin worried that the Soviets had a clear path to the city there is nothing between us no anti-tank gun no anti-tank obstacles not a single soldier [Music] the eyes of the world were now converging on Berlin as Stalin's Army is prepared for their final Act of Vengeance that would eradicate Nazi Germany once and for all although the Allies had promised to leave Berlin to the Red Army the ever paranoid Stalin still urged haste in the capture of the city the final Plan called for a three-pronged attack on the Berlin axis to encircle and capture the city within 12 to 15 days then move on to meet the Allies at the Elbow River zhukov's first belarussian front would be at the center of the thrust while Marshall Ivan conniff's first Ukrainian front to the South was set to attack across the Niza River in the direction of Potsdam and Dresden finally Marshall Constantine roccosovsky's second Belarusian front would tie down German forces to the north in the sector to prevent them from reinforcing Berlin having become accustomed to fighting on wide open terrain few in the Red Army had much experience in large-scale urban street fighting it was up to General vasili choykov's eighth guards army veterans of the Battle of Stalingrad to distribute pamphlets on Urban Warfare while special combined arms task forces were formed Red Army Engineers on their part worked day and night to construct hundreds of bridges and thousands of wooden assault boats to cross the odor and naiza rivers to achieve this Soviet planners had to find a way to move 29 armies over hundreds of kilometers to create shock groups capable of penetrating the German line in areas only 2.5 to 10 kilometers or 1.5 to 6 miles in width when it was all said and done the Red Army would Advance on Berlin with some 2.5 million men 6 250 tanks and self-propelled guns and 7500 combat aircraft aiming to make the Invaders bleed for every inch of German soil the vermacht constructed a series of well-entrenched defensive lines which barricaded the way into Berlin Manning these positions were the remains of army group fistula and fourth Panzer Army as well as the Berlin Garrison combined this Force consisted of 750 000 German soldiers supported by 1519 tanks and assault guns nine thousand three hundred and three guns and mortars and 2 200 aircraft however these numbers looked more impressive on paper than they did in reality as virtually all of its formations were under strength although many units were led by battle-hardened Veterans of the Eastern Front their Rank and file was often made up of a mix of wounded unfit and inexperienced soldiers and even boys from the Hitler Youth moreover some sixty thousand of the Defenders came from under trained and barely armed volkster militia battalions the Infantry would not be able to count much on its armored and air assets either as the Germans lacked the fuel reserves to keep its otherwise considerable force of fighting Vehicles operational for any extended period of time morale was also at an all-time low most suffered from malnutrition and a lack of hygiene and saved for the most fanatical Nazis few now believed in the promise of final victory even so every effort was made to convince the men that the much anticipated wunderwaffen would still turn the tide of the war and that peace talks with the Western allies were soon to bear fruit but if these motivations were only marginally effective the widespread fear of Soviet Vengeance and barbarism drove even the most cynical to continue fighting on April 12th the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra gave its last performance among the music played was Richard Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries four days later another type of Orchestra began to play as thousands of katyusha rocket launchers and field guns of zhukov's front opened up on the first German defensive line along the Zelo Heights miles away in Berlin's Eastern suburbs houses began to shake as terrified citizens gathered in the street to listen to the start of the coming storm a stunned Russian engineer described to the unfolding spectacle along the whole lengths of the Horizon it was bright as daylight on the German side everything was covered with smoke and thick foundations of Earth and clumps flying up there were huge flocks of scared birds flying around in the sky a constant humming Thunder explosions we had to cover our ears to prevent our eardrums breaking as the sound of artillery gradually faded hundreds of men began shouting to Berlin as tank engines roared and the elite assault elements began advancing toward the heights many of the German Defenders unfortunate enough to have been caught in the preceding Onslaught had disappeared in the blink of an eye while dazed and panic-stricken survivors rushed back toward the second defensive line however the awesome bombardment obscured serious problems in zhukov's plan the destruction caused by the shelling had been so great in scope that it had severely worsened the condition of the terrain that his men now had to Traverse the searchlights intended to Blind the enemy instead reflected onto the smoke-filled air and obscured the vision of the advancing infantry in the resulting chaos units lost contact with each other as Soviet artillery and aircraft began attacking friendly formations worse still German intelligence had had prior knowledge of the coming offensive which meant that many of the first-line troops had been evacuated to the safety of the rear what ensued was nothing less than what a member of the gross Deutschland guard regiment described as a slaughterhouse countless soldiers were cut down as they struggled to advance across the flood Plains and through German minefields in other sectors too the attackers were cut down and repulsed as they attempted to cross the odor sensing disaster and increasingly agitated zhukov ordered his two tank armies to attack at once however most of the infantry's artillery and Supply Vehicles were still trying to make their way to the front causing the tank armies to become hopelessly stuck in an endless traffic jam even when the lead armor finally approached the heights they found themselves ambushed by concealed 88 gun emplacements Tiger 1 tanks and infantry armed with deadly Panzer fouls to recoilless anti-tank launchers unsurprisingly zhukov's decimated men had made little progress at the end of the first day and it would take three more days and countless more dead before his armies finally forced their way through the final defensive line naturally Stalin was infuriated but he could rest easy in the fact that coneb's front to the South had seen more success by the end of April the 18th his tank armies were across the spray River and were racing toward Berlin lacking sufficient reinforcements and ammunition the surviving defenders in both sectors were forced into a headlong retreat with the German defensive lines in the South and in the center broken and with vital troops in the north still tied down in heavy fighting the road to Berlin lay open lacking the supplies to keep on fighting German morale now visibly began to collapse thousands of encircled men surrendered while masses of stragglers deserters and refugees made their way into the doomed City all the while an increasingly delusional Hitler continued to demand fanatical resistance until The Bitter End on April 20th the fuhrer's birthday was rudely interrupted by Soviet artillery shelling Berlin's Northeastern suburbs as its citizens fled into Sellers zhukov and konaf's tank armies began a frantic race to these City's outskirts in the meantime many senior officials of the Nazi party engaged in a similar type of competition to be the first one to get permission to flee the city soldiers on the ground enjoyed no such Privileges and those who tried to run or displayed signs of cowardice were summarily hanged throughout the city with messages such as I was a coward or I was a deserter dangling from their chests the next morning Soviet artillery fired a frenzy barrage into Berlin's City Center while the remains of General Helmut vaidling's 56th Panzer Corps of the German ninth Army conducted a desperate withdrawal across Berlin's Autobahn ring while being mercilessly strafed by Soviet aircraft other remnants of the German defense attempted in vain to stop zhukov's armies from pushing into the city from the southwestern and Northern flanks however its depleted units could only delay the enemy and zhukov and konaf's forces both reached the city's outskirts that evening believing himself to be the next Frederick the great Hitler remained confident that a massive counter-stroke by the newly created Army Detachment Steiner and Ninth Army against zhukov's flanks would trap the Invaders In The City in a ploy similar to what had befallen the Germans at Stalingrad two years prior when it became clear on the following day that Schneider's Army Detachment lacked sufficient strength and ammunition to attack the fuhrer finally cracked and openly admitted for the first time that all was hopelessly lost with the Soviets breaking into the city General widling was appointed commander of the Berlin defense area however by the time vidling took command only about 45 000 Vermont and SS troops just over 40 000 men of the volksterm and a measly 60 fuel starved tanks were left standing to defend the city against some 1.5 million Soviet troops unsurprisingly zhukov's armies had managed to push the Defenders out of the eastern and Southeastern suburbs by the end of the 23rd while other fronts tightened their grasp around the city's flanks with Inevitable Defeat looming on the horizon many of the Defenders began to lay down their arms others however continued to resist fanatically at the templehof airport a mixed group of ss-led German Defenders including some 100 Hitler Youth wreaked havoc on the attacking Soviet tanks and infantry who had to resort to massive aerial and artillery bombardment to finally capture the airport a day later [Music] by that time the encirclement of Berlin had been completed however a manic Hitler promised weidling that yet another massive counter-offensive by General vank's 12th Army in the southwest was sure to come to the rescue of the beleaguered Defenders venk however had no intention on embarking in a futile suicide mission and instead moved to relieve encircled German troops further to the east with no further hope of relief weidling urged the fearer to Stage a breakout Westward to join up with remnants of army group Vistula Hitler however rejected the plan and restated his intention to fall at the head of his troops during the next three days the Red Army tightened its hold on Berlin as the advancing armies closed in on the inner defensive line protecting the governmental District the lack of clear demarcation lines between the fronts however led to various formations competing for space and getting hopelessly confused in the ensuing Quagmire after careful deliberation it was decided that most of konaf's frustrated men were to be redeployed to Czechoslovakia while zhukov was to go in for the final kill by the end of the 29th the eighth guards Army had blasted its way through the heavily defended tiergarten sector while the third shock Army had crossed the spray over the maltika bridge just to the north in front of them lay the Ultimate Prize the blackened walls of the reichstag the former Parliamentary Building widely regarded as the symbolic heart of the Third Reich capturing it would be nothing less than the culmination of the entire Soviet war effort the defense of the building and its surroundings was led by a determined group of mostly foreign SS Fighters with little less to lose in the morning of the following day Soviet artillery opened fire as a few hundred assault troops rushed forward after a heavy fire fight the men reached the main entrance and proceeded to clear the building in brutal Close Quarters combat after hours of bitter fighting the red banner was spotted hanging from the second floor at around 2 30 PM but it wouldn't be until late in the evening before a path to the roof had finally been cleared two sergeants identified as mikayo yagorov and melaton kantaria managed to reach the top and hoisted the hammer and sickle on top of the reichstag marking the symbolic end of Hitler's Third Reich as this historic moment unfolded an even more momentous event occurred barely a kilometer away with Soviet troops converging on his bunker complex the embittered fuhrer knew that he had reached the end of the line the German people had failed him and his vision of a Thousand-Year Reich after giving vaidling the go-ahead to attempt a belated breakout the fuhrer set his farewells to his remaining staff poisoned his dog Blondie and retired to his study room to commit suicide together with his newly wedded bride Ava Brown but Hitler's death did not put an immediate end to the fighting the new Chancellor Joseph Goebbels rejected Stalin's demand for an unconditional surrender of the Garrison prompting the Red Army to blast the remaining German positions until the defense was reduced to little more than a few isolated pockets with gerbil's subsequent suicide being announced that night the door to peace in Berlin could finally be opened at 6am on May 2nd General weidling officially ordered his remaining men to lay down their arms when the guns finally fell silent in the afternoon an eerie silence descended on the city of which troykov would later write the flame of world war was quenched there once it arose although fighting in Europe would continue until Germany's unconditional surrender on May 8th the war had come to a climax at the Battle of Berlin the capture of Germany's capital had cost the Red Army an estimated 78 000 men killed in action and over 274 000 wounded in return the Germans had lost some 90 to 100 000 men killed in action as well as at least another 200 000 wounded during their Advance into Germany the vengeful Red Army had left a trail of pillage and destruction in its wake an estimated 95 000 to 130 000 women in Berlin alone are said to have been sexually assaulted of which ten thousand would later commit suicide still many Germans were relieved that the conflict was finally over and that a semblance of normal human life was slowly returning under shared Allied Soviet occupation however the alliance between the two Victors would prove short-lived and the star of the Cold War would Usher a new type of crisis in the city which had suffered so much during the second World War the German soldiers shovel pierces the soft loam for the last year he has worked on a farm in the Southern United States transferred to a labor detail after several months in a Detention Center he and his fellows have spent their time laboring in the fields watching American films and thinking about what they'll do once the war is over the Americans work their charges hard but they are fed well and are treated better than the black sharecroppers who labor alongside them perhaps our soldier thinks he will have a new trade to practice when he returns home the German soldiers shovel strains against the Frozen Earth for the last year he has worked in a graveyard in the Soviet Union transferred to a labor detail after several months in a Detention Center he and his fellows have spent their time shunting Frozen corpses languishing in Spartan barracks and fighting desperately to survive the Soviets worked their charges hard but the privations of War mean the Communists can barely feed themselves much less prisoners of War perhaps our soldier thinks he will soon join his former comrades Who Stare blankly at him from the pit Korean when VE day was declared in 1945 the Allied powers held roughly 11 million German soldiers as prisoners of war the vast majority of these close to 8 million had been captured by the Western allies while the remaining 3 million were in the custody of the Soviet Union with Europe liberated from Nazi aggression the Allied Powers were left with a critical question what to do with their 11 million pows the issue was a divisive one to say the least as while the Western allies were signatories to the Geneva Convention which very clearly demanded the release of prisoners the moment the war ended the Soviets had notably abstained from signing the international agreement this meant that a captured German soldier's fate was ostensibly decided by whose hands they fell into but war is a brutal business and sometimes even international law is just ink on a piece of paper [Music] during the War years German soldiers were imprisoned in roughly 20 countries around the world including in the continental United States while Stateside many German prisoners were leased out to Farms or factories to serve as laborers providing additional hands to make up for the workers lost to the draft a hotbed of this leasing activity was the southern U.S where German pows befriended American citizens and watched Hollywood films during their off hours overall pow sent to the U.S were treated humanely and deaths of Germans in American custody were low at 491. things were different in the internment camps in Europe where American estimates for pows who died in custody lie in the low thousands while German tallies claim up to 40 000 fatalities in American custody the Americans early release of many prisoners complicates attaining an exact number for their part the British Empire managed the fate of up to 2.5 million German pows by the war's end Germans kept in Great Britain could be housed in anything from tents set up in a pastoral field to elegant manor houses repurposed as surprisingly Posh prisons similar to their comrades in the U.S German pows in Britain enjoyed a cordial relationship with British civilians who gave them money and foods that they were not usually fed Germans in Britain could also be put onto a labor detail for which they were paid a respectable two Shillings per day of work the number of German pows who died in British custody was 1254. British soldiers as well as American were also reported to have engaged in torture when interrogating Germans suspected of committing war crimes often leading to confessions extracted under duress but this was far from the worst a German captured on the Western Front could expect that dubious dishonor lies with France German soldiers captured during the liberation of France as well as a number relocated there from American custody faced abysmal conditions and vengeful civilians French citizens would verbally harass or assault German prisoners stoning or beating them sometimes to death some POW camps seemed designed for extermination rather than detention a French camp in the SAT gave its inmates only 900 calories worth of rations per day for comparison a Jew living in the early days of the Warsaw Ghetto was on paper at least allotted just over 1 000 calories of rations by the Nazis an average of 12 pows died daily at the SATA camp and shortly after VE Day the Red Cross reported that almost 200 000 German soldiers in French custody faced imminent starvation the United States was forced to Halt any further shipments of pows to France and mandate their adherence to the Geneva Convention and act that in practice was largely symbolic the end of the war meant according to international law repatriation but for the Western allies the end of the war largely seemed to mean reparation the U.S and Britain leased roughly 1 million German pows to the French to rebuild their country while 64 000 went to Belgium 10 000 to the Netherlands and 5000 to Luxembourg Germans on the continent would assist in reconstruction building roads or working in Sawmills and quarries some in France and the Netherlands were made to clear minefields 2000 pows were killed or maimed each month doing this conscripting the workers this way was a clear violation of the Geneva Convention but the Western allies claimed that since the German government technically did not exist their charges were not prisoners of war and therefore were not entitled to the protections afforded to pows thank you the Soviets had suffered greatly in their war against Fascism and they did not want a pound of Flesh for their trouble they wanted tons Soviet plans for post-war reconstruction included the use of German pows as forced labor as early as 1944. Ivan maisky Soviet ambassador to the British Empire called for the Germans to be given as reparations to the Soviet Union for a lengthy period which he ultimately defined as 10 years myski would refine his proposal for the Yalta Conference and provided Stalin with a full-scale plan to get the USSR a supply of 5 million German pows to be used as forced labor for a decade after victory was achieved with this Mass conscription and the Planned seizure of German land and wealth the Soviets hoped they could keep the German people from Ever fighting against the USSR again with the war's end and the carving of Germany into occupation zones the Soviet plans were put into effect Soviet authorities began identifying their new charges with ethnic Germans in Soviet territory investigated to determine if they had served in the war any who had verifiable vermacht service were ordered to Soviet POW camps to be prepared for forced labor the Soviets would organize their new workers into battalions of three to five thousand men divided into one thousand man companies they were primarily used for construction and heavy industry with a laser focus on rebuilding the utterly devastated Soviet Union three million Germans would be drafted into these Soviet labor companies a full third would die there it should be noted however that this may not have been the result of direct Soviet action or negligence theirs was a war of annihilation where both German and Soviet gave no quarter and expected none consequently a number of the men forced into these labor companies were pows captured by the Soviets directly and due to the horrible conditions of the Eastern Front came into Soviet custody malnourished sick utterly exhausted or some combination of the three but it would not have been pragmatic for the Soviets to intentionally slaughter their newly acquired labor pool so shortly after a war that devastated their working population from 1945 to 1946 many pows who were too sick to work were simply released by the Soviets rather than beworked to death a bad Harvest and endemic corruption and mismanagement seemed to be behind the travails of German forest laborers in the early post-war years however as time wore on the German laborers began to prove more trouble than their Soviet Masters thought them worth UW labor was a surprisingly expensive Enterprise and had to constantly be subsidized by the main Soviet economy the Germans contributed roughly 5 of the Soviet Union's total national income a far cry from the grand reparation envisioned by maisky and his 10 years of servitude in a surprisingly capitalist move Soviet industrial leaders began to see their German Workers as unprofitable and began to skimp on their responsibilities to feed and care for them after all why waste good money and material on what they saw as fascist parasites as their industrial managers began to sour on the concept Soviet leaders began making moves toward repatriation in 1947 the foreign Ministers of the Allied Powers agreed that they would repatriate all German pows by 1948. the Soviet effort would last well into 1950 with roughly 26 000 German pows who had been convicted of war crimes by Soviet courts not sent back to Germany as late as 1956. overall Germans in the Soviet Union after the war were faced with mandatory hard labor under challenging conditions but the majority were repatriated long before the initial plan of 10 years but what of Germany's soldiers who had been discharged before the war's end or who had deserted their fears Crusade against the rest of the world or who simply had been far enough away from the front lines that they were not captured those Germans who escaped capture and who were in the western occupation zones found themselves cast adrift in a new Germany the Allies were Keen to strip Germany of any martial will and to this end of militarism of any military inclined organization or Club this meant that German Veterans of the second world war unlike their former foes had no support system to help them transition back into civilian life these suddenly demobilized soldiers found themselves in a country gripped by denotification as the Western allies sought to purge the influence of Hitler and goebbel's propaganda machine and eliminate all traces of Nazi ideology and warmongering to this end former soldiers were ordered to present themselves to Allied tribunals for summary judgment originally run by the occupying forces before being handed off to German authorities in 1946 these tribunals would take stock of the defendant's military and civilian activities during the war the court would then categorize the defendant as a major offender offender lesser offender follower or give them a full exoneration by and large Rank and file members of the vermasht were categorized as lesser offenders and sentenced to a three-year period of probation during this time they were prohibited from holding public office or running their own businesses as more and more defendants were found or presented themselves the tribunal system began to buckle under an ever-growing caseload and judges began finding or making a multitude of exceptions to speed the process up disabled veterans were often Exempted from judgment along with those who could prove that they were impoverished during the War years or were born after 1919 while this system succeeded in streamlining the process of former vermacht Personnel it allowed those with real Nazi sympathies to slip through the cracks denotsification was abandoned in the 1950s as its inefficiencies became more apparent and the German public began pushing back on the idea of individual culpability why reckon with your part in crimes against humanity when you can simply pin it all on a dead Austrian painter and move on with your life foreign in one of History's moments of irony many former vermacht Personnel judged by the Allies for their service would soon find themselves right back in uniform with the growing threat of the Soviets to the east the Allied Powers realized that a militarized Germany would prove a keen Ally should the world descend into another global conflict the bundesvere was established in November of 1955 and many former Vermont soldiers could be found in its ranks sometimes wielding these same weapons they used to fight against the allies foreign the war criminals of Nazi Germany from the highest echelons of military and civilian leadership to rank and file guards were arraigned on charges of crimes against humanity and prosecuted at a series of Trials most famously at Nuremberg prosecutors from all Allied Nations presented a preponderance of evidence ranging from private Diaries to ledgers of concentration camps to military dispatches the prosecution's point was clear the military was equally responsible for Hitler's Horrors as the SS and civilian leadership there was no distinction to be drawn between the independent and politically minded SS and the duly enlisted soldiers of the Vermont while separate these two cogs in Hitler's machine of annihilation would often work in Sinister concert the Vermont would take an area and the SS would Purge it of undesirables Military Officers such as kaido and high ministers like ribbentrop were hanged While others were sentenced to prison terms ranging from life to time served others such as Hermann Goring took their own lives rather than face the hangman there were even a few female defendants such as the sadistic hyena of auschwitzer klasa was ultimately hanged for her brutal treatment of concentration camp inmates unusual for a time when executing women was a stark Rarity but these people were still allowed a defense and theirs was simple we were just following orders the thrust of these arguments was that any Nazi Soldier officer official or Minister accused of crimes against humanity was simply following a directive from a higher authority some in fact falsified orders to show that they had no choice in the matter creating false Paper Trails to justify their own malice and cruelty toward Jews Roma lgbtq people and others the Nazi party declared undesirable many of these false stories were pushed by the defendant's families who were tired of the war tired of the Reckoning and just wanted their son's daughters husbands or wives home whether they were a monster or not this attitude began to pervade German public Consciousness with unfortunate results in 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany was founded a new German state for a new German people the first Chancellor of this new Germany Conrad Adenauer opened his tenure by announcing plans for a general amnesty for war criminals who had been sentenced by the occupying powers the desire for Germany to be an ally against possible Soviet aggression trumped the desire for justice and spring of 1950 saw The Advisory board on clemency for award criminals established to review cases for leniency 105 cases were brought to the Advisory Board in August of 1950 as family and friends of convicted war criminals as well as representatives of the new German government presented all manner of mitigating evidence from medical history to the newly birthed clean vermacht myth which stated emphatically that all Nazi crimes were the fault of the SS and Hitler's Inner Circle proponents of the clean Vermont myth argued to this day that the common soldier of Nazi Germany was an honorable chivalrous man fighting for home and hearth untainted by the atrocities of his peers and the hateful rhetoric of his leaders 84 of the 105 cases heard by The Advisory Board were dramatically lessened or outright commuted and the fairy tale myth of the acclaimed vermasht spread through the German populace generations of Germans believed in a sharp divide between their ancestors who fought for Hitler and his crimes eager to compartmentalize the shame of their nation's atrocities and their own family histories [Music] War like history is never simple nor clean the soldiers of Germany captured on the battlefield rightfully expected to be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention and in many cases they were until the wars end the pragmatic and vindictive moves by the Allies to force German pows into rebuilding Europe do not excuse the crimes of Nazi Germany just as Nazi atrocities do not excuse Allied violations of the Geneva Convention it is imperative that we remember history is not entirely black and white but rather painted Shades of Gray with definite areas of clear morality and Humanity to simplify history into West versus East good versus evil or any dichotomy is to ignore the true lessons our history has to teach us and the most profound lessons are often to be learned in its darkest chapters [Music] thank you\",\n",
       " \" [Music] thank you [Music] hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian while we're all familiar with the plight that the second world war incurred on Germany rarely is its aftermath analyzed in great detail today we will dig deeper into why Germany was ultimately divided into East and West and how the German people suffered during the first years after the war could the post-war division of Germany have been avoided discuss this topic and more on our Discord the first discussion about the post-war future of Germany was held at the Tehran Conference in 1943. the Allies agreed on the occupation Division and new borders of Germany but the four zones of occupation were only agreed upon at the Yalta Conference in early 1945. still it was the post-war Potsdam Conference that truly set the groundwork for how Germany was going to be divided and occupied the British initially were opposed to occupation concerned about the costs it could incur on their already strapped finances they were eventually won over by Deep American Pockets instead of administering and policing Germany side by side as the Allies did in post-war Austria the decision was made at Potsdam to divide Germany into four distinct occupation zones one for each Allied Nation the British were assigned the Northwest Quadrant the French the southwest and the Americans the southeast as the Red Army already occupied much of Eastern Germany the Soviet Union was put in charge of the Northeast quadrant which included Berlin the French also decided to make the rich coal provinces of the azarland a protectorate although this was not recognized by the other major powers following its defeat in the second world war Germany was stripped of all of the territories it had captured about a quarter of its old pre-war territory was divvied up between Poland and the Soviet Union the northern part of East Prussia the Cradle of Prussian militarism which many claimed for both world wars was annexed by the Soviets and renamed kaliningrad oblast meanwhile the southern part of East Prussia as well as the rich industrial areas of Silesia and Pomerania were handed over to the poles U.S and British forces had actually Advanced further than they were supposed to according to the Yalta Conference as a result they relinquished the territory and in return the Soviets allowed Berlin to be divided into four sectors the Allies soon created the Allied control Council the governing body of post-war Germany the council was supposed to allow each power to exercise authority over their respective zone of occupation while still cooperating in decisions that affected the whole country in reality this was not the case the French with aspirations for a dismembered Germany and resentful at their exclusion from the conferences continually blocked any progress toward re-establishing German governing institutions meanwhile these Soviets were busy dismantling and shipping anything that could be useful to reconstruct their war-torn country as I'll explain the economic situation in the zones deteriorated rapidly into Mass supply shortages forcing people to grow their own food hoard and steal Goods today a similar economic situation once again fueled by global conflict is occurring the effects of which are being felt fittingly enough in Germany where Deutsche Bank is fighting to survive a historic bank run right on the heels of the second biggest bank collapse in U.S history and just like post-war Germany everyday citizens are being impacted take the United States where over half of the people making six figures are currently living paycheck to paycheck experts like Goldman Sachs are advising clients to diversify their wealth from stocks and bonds into new alternative assets

the Allies met at Yalta and decided upon the four zones of occupation another plan was devised by the U.S Secretary of the Treasury Henry morgenthau the morganthal plan would have seen Germany entirely demilitarized and divided into three parts a Northern State a Southern state and a de-industrialized international Zone in the west administered by the United Nations the intention was to prevent Germany from ever developing a military industry or Waging War in the future besides support from U.S President Franklin T Roosevelt the plan was almost universally disliked and was subsequently scrapped however the sentiment of harsh measures and pastoralizing Germany to neutralize it as a threat remained in addition to rampant Soviet and French Industrial dismantlement in their occupation zones the Allied control Council also limited industrial and steel production as a result Germany was reduced to the meager standard of living it had known at the height of the Great Depression the economic plight of Germany was further exacerbated by the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern territories these removals Remain the largest movement or transfer of any single ethnic population in European history they occurred in three overlapping phases first was the organized evacuation of ethnic Germans by the Nazi government in the face of the advancing Red Army the second was the disorganized fleeing of Germans following the Vermont's defeat and the third was the more organized expulsion dictated by the Potsdam agreement millions of Germans were expelled from Poland Czechoslovakia and Hungary while many contemporaries argued that these expulsions were necessary to prevent ethnic violence hundreds of thousands would die on The Journey either by Soviet bullets during the war or by Cold stress and hunger after it furthermore Germans that remained in territories that later fell under the Soviet Union would be deported to camps in Central Asia and and Siberia where they were used as forced labor as masses of German ex-bellies arrived to the war-torn remains of Germany shortages of food housing and other Goods led to conflicts with the local population France which had not participated in the Potsdam Conference and thus argued that they did not have to bear the responsibilities for decisions made during it refused to accept most expelles into their Zone soon it became apparent that the economic recovery of Europe could not go forward without the Reconstruction of the German industrial base as a result in July of 1947 the U.S president Harry S Truman rescinded the harsh occupation directives on National Security grounds and stressed that an orderly prosperous Europe required the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany this sentiment was further compounded by the growing needs to rearm the Germans as a potential ally against the Soviets the Western allies were increasingly concerned about the deteriorating economic situation in their zones with the U.S occupation Zone administrator General Lucius clay remarking there is no choice between being a communist on 1500 calories a day and a believer in democracy on 1000 calories as a result the Marshall Plan was extended to the recently created by Zone in 1948 a currency reform which had been prohibited under the previous morgenthal occupation directive introduced the Deutsche Mark these developments enraged the Soviets who withdrew from the Allied control Council and ordered the blockade of Berlin the Allies responded with the Berlin airlift which lasted almost a year soon after the Berlin blockade started the French would join their occupation Zone with the buy Zone establishing a short-lived tri-zone later on May 23rd of 1949 West Germany would be established followed by East Germany on October 7th the division of Germany was an improvised matter while initially the Allies intended to rule Germany in concert with each other high tensions and the spark of the Cold War meant that neither side wanted to risk damage to their own interests in essence this meant that the Allies abandoned East Germany to these Soviets

Federal Constitution in 1848 marked it as one of the oldest modern republics in the world their security was not always guaranteed however once sandwiched between Empires the rise of fascism found Switzerland now caught between the Ambitions of Mussolini's Italy to the South and Hitler's Germany to the north still the Swiss Health firm having declared their neutrality in March 1938 thanks to a long-standing tradition of active neutrality fascist elements remained weak in Swiss Society much weaker than other European countries at the time a combination of national spirit and swiss cultural norms helped support their commitment to Independence as tensions deepened throughout Europe Switzerland saw the need to reduce its Reliance on food imports a government official by the name of Dr Fritz vollen created a program to increase arable land alongside the promotion of pig breeding to boost numbers of non-fodter-based livestock across the country vollen also pressed to cut back the raising of Thieves steers and calves which drastically reduced the production of fodder and increased the surface of arable land allowing for an abundance of grain to be produced over the coming years alarmed by developments from German expansion in 1938 the Swiss government raised the age limit for compulsory military service to 60 hoping to draw many recruits from their pool of roughly 4.3 million citizens by the war's outbreak most of these mobilized citizens were trained marksmen thanks to an already existing proliferation of gun ownership among the Swiss population as president Philip Etter once remarked the Swiss will never part with his gun symbol and protection of his freedom and Independence in effect the Swiss Army was to be a citizen's Army based on universal military training service in the reserves and the keeping of arms and ammunition at home spearheading the Swiss military was General Henry Gezon commander-in-chief of the Swiss Army elected on August 30th 1939 General Giza quickly became popular thanks to his extensive mobilization efforts and defensive preparations aimed at protecting the country at all available costs behind gizal the slogan of spiritual National Defense Was Heard throughout all cantons of Switzerland the term became a rallying cry for the nation as it faced the most powerful threat in its history [Applause] foreign two days after Germany's fateful invasion of Poland the number of mobilized Swiss citizens totaled 435 000 with an extra thousand volunteer Sharpshooters helping bolster these numbers later in the month throughout the rest of September the Swiss remains diligent in their preparations and defenses all over the country servicemen were building field fortifications artillery positions tank traps hidden concrete covered trenches and machine gun nests Bridges were also mined and Road obstacles were set in place president Etter declared if War extends to our country it will find us ready men women soldiers civilians old and young all of whom swear to give their life to their country preferring death rather than slavery early October saw the fall of Poland reach its completion and general Giza intensified planning for an expected Invasion these included plans made in the event of case West a French incursion into Swiss territory as well as the more likely case North a German invasion to outflank the imagino line through the Alps gizal issued operation order number two which described the critical positions in the north that were to be held up to the last cartridge as German troop concentrations gathered on the southern border November and December saw the Swiss continue in their efforts to reshape their nation into a fortified Mountain redoubt the Germans were aware of these developments with high command estimating that it would take the Vermont 40 days to cross Switzerland and that it would be necessary to oppose the Swiss five to one to achieve it in a near total contrast from Germany's Blitzkrieg Theory the Swiss instead opted for a defensive strategy which hoped to contain the enemy's mechanized attack within smaller contained zones bogging them down in slow methodical and brutal engagements despite logistical difficulties with construction this approach had the desired effect of deterring the Germans and forcing them to reconsider their trusted strategy during the phony War period between September 1939 to May 1940 the mood was tense on the Western Front however for Switzerland things were only ramping up already since September of the previous year the Swiss military had been dealing with aerial violations over Swiss airspace by now Swiss anti-air batteries had opened fire on both French and German warplanes that chose to stray over their border the Battle of France which began on May 10 1940 was Switzerland's first major test of resolve already on the first day of Germany's Invasion into France Swiss anti-airguns and Fighters engaged both German and French aircraft Crossings Swiss airspace 27 German bombs landed in Northern Switzerland damaging a railway as the Battle of France raged on luftwaffe incursions into Swiss airspace became more common and the Swiss Air Force harshly expelled the Germans through repeated sorties against any intruding aircraft more German bombers were shot down in early June with a noted dogfight involving 29 German bombers and fighter bombers against a dozen Swiss Fighters over show the fall in Western Switzerland two German and one Swiss plane were shot down the German airplanes were found with the following order lure these Swiss Fighters into battle and shoot down as many as possible more dogfights ensued in the following days with a grand total of 11 German to only three Swiss planes shot down after the fall of France on June 10th Switzerland quickly found itself surrounded in Europe for a brief period Swiss morale wavered with the defeat of their French neighbors though efforts by General Giza rallied his people to the cause of National Defense with plenty of food and ammunition stockpiled hizon's National redoubt plan would see the bulk of the army abandon the Swiss plateau and take up position in the nation's fortified mountain ranges from where it could resist an Invader for many months all relevant industry and infrastructure would be blown up the second in axis Army set foot on Swiss soil with this strategy Giza hoped to deter the Germans from embarking on a likely highly costly and time-intensive campaign especially with Britain still in the war another way for these Swiss to evade the invasion was to acquiesce to some axis demands for one Switzerland felt forced to submit to Berlin's demands for free commercial Transit and for access to Swiss Financial Services notably the Swiss also allowed German and Italian military supply trains to pass through its borders for which they charged the axis even while Germany halted the export of coal to Switzerland and severely lessened the export of food meanwhile Swiss Air defenses were still dealing with incursions this time from retaliatory strikes caused by the British royal Air Force who would mistakenly hit Swiss targets thinking them to be German one example happened as early as June 12th when the RAF accidentally dropped bombs near Geneva killing five and injuring 50 Swiss from here on this Swiss would remain grimly determined in their air war against both the Allied and Axis powers foreign was busy Shoring up defenses through troop concentrations and air patrols another key part of Switzerland's defense came in Espionage and intelligence Swiss intelligence had established a reliable spy Network across Europe to help notify them of important developments in the war one agency known as The Bureau ha used the Viking line spy Network to tap directly into Adolf Hitler's own headquarters [Music] starting in 1941 Switzerland took on an increasingly diplomatic role on the world stage as it represented the interests of the United States United Kingdom Canada Australia New Zealand and Germany among others still the Swiss government refused to recognize axis conquests and continue to host the occupied Nations embassies in Barron which resulted in many scathing attacks against the country from the Nazi press another stress upon the Swiss cause for non-alignment came in 1942 when the Germans occupied Vichy France all but isolating the Swiss from the rest of Europe until 1943 all Jewish refugees fleeing the vaishi regime into Switzerland were refused entry rounded up and escorted back to France the Swiss government Justified its Draconian immigration laws claiming that subversive agents were entering the country among the refugees and that these Swiss people might lose jobs to the immigrants and that many immigrants would not move on to third countries as such a ban was imposed upon any Refugee or migrant engaging in any professional activity paid or unpaid [Music] still these policies were deeply unpopular among many of the Swiss population and over the war many refugees including women and children were able to cross the border and shelter in camps by May of 1945 the Swiss were holding over 115 000 people in refugee camps across the country [Music] foreign 1943 the Swiss were dealing with a developing situation on both sides of the conflict Allied intelligence networks such as the office of strategic Services established in Barron were actively gathering information about the Nazis and helping resistant cells adjacent to the Swiss border on the other hand axis military developments found the Swiss becoming more concerned about the possibility of a German invasion General gizal especially had become alarmed by rumors of Fortress Europe a planned german-ringed defense of its core European territories based out of the Alps despite Switzerland's official policy of neutrality they couldn't help but find themselves shifting over to the Allied side of the line something which German aggression certainly did not help amend when the Allies landed in Sicily the threat of invasion again loomed as Germans occupying Northern Italy looked to secure supply lines to their troops Railway tunnels running between Italy and Germany through the Swiss border became crucial targets for the Vermont in response the Swiss warned the Germans that these tunnels would be destroyed if they dared to invade relations with the axis declined but the latter end of the war saw damaged relations with the Allies as well prior to the commencement of Operation Overlord in 1944 Allied bombers had pounded Germany's occupied zones continuously in order to weaken them a side effect of this came with further intrusions into Swiss airspace including more accidental bombardments of Swiss targets during this period the Swiss press changed its once friendly tone towards Britain into a swath of denunciations mostly due to the high civilian casualties caused by RAF mistakes the United States Air Force Was Not Innocent of these violations either as many B-17 and B-24 bombers were forcefully evicted by Swiss aircraft in one terrible misfortune 40 Swiss civilians were reported killed and over 270 seriously wounded when 30 B-24 bombers dropped incendiary Bombs Over the city of schafhausen as the war pushed further into the German Heartland Switzerland attempt to maintain the Integrity of its borders preventing any advancing Allied armies from using their territory as strategic shortcuts to push quickly into the Reich despite shaky relations between the two sides the Swiss held firm standing by cautiously as the Allies steamrolled into the bombed out ruins of Nazi Germany altogether Switzerland invested a total of 8 billion Swiss Francs in its defenses accruing a national debt of 9 billion Swiss Francs by 1945 but with its infrastructure intact Switzerland experienced a rapid economic upswing contributing 200 million Swiss Francs to the rebuilding of neighboring war-damaged countries despite strict immigration laws they had also given Refuge to some 300 000 people while Switzerland's neutral position has not always been met positively by other nations armed neutrality was the best strategy the Swiss could pursue in order to remain independent from German rule support the show on patreon and gain unique

of the Germans yet the final year of the war had at least initially been marked by promising developments during their spring offensive newly formed Stormtrooper units performed well armed with revolutionary tactics and the latest Weaponry these specialized units had almost single-handedly reintroduced movement to the static Battlefield of the Western Front the reichsvair post-war studies reviewing Stormtrooper successes hoped to create a new and even more formidable army capable of overpowering the enemy before he would have a chance to respond in force based on the experiences of the previous war Germany's foremost military Minds concluded that the modern infantry Squad ought to be designed to promote self-sufficiency rapid movement as well as deliver overwhelming Firepower the Prussian military tradition which emphasized Duty and honor in military service was still a factor in German culture but Nazi organizations such as the Hitler Youth and Reich Labor Service sought to fully re-militarize Society by physically and mentally preparing the German folk for military service from a young age men entering service were instilled with an offensively minded spirit that favored aggression of movement and the attack even while defending the underlying idea was that the attacker retains the initiative on the battlefield and could decide when and where to fight on his own terms the squad leaders who were to direct these assaults in turn were expected to be tough men who could act decisively Under Fire they would be able to quickly recognize and seize opportune moments on the battlefield as they arose or as the German tactical manual read to be a leader in the field a superior must display an exemplary bearing before his men in the moment of danger and be willing if necessary to die for them this combination of superior leadership and training would make up for any potential deficiencies in Manpower which could lead to complete success against a numerically Superior opponent [Music] at the outbreak of the second world war German squads were composed of 10 men consisting of a squad leader armed with a submachine gun six Riflemen armed with the Carabiner 98k an ammo carrier and a two-man machine gun team equipped with the mg-34 and later on the mg-42 in contrast to Allied infantry squads which emphasized the role of The Rifleman Moore German squads were entirely centered around their machine gun to accommodate this machine gun teams no longer formed a separate section within an infantry unit but were fully integrated within the squad hierarchy both of Germany's general purpose machine guns the mg-34 and especially the later mg-42 sported remarkably High rates of Fire outclassing any of their Allied counterparts they were seen as exemplary tools to completely devastate an enemy force and produce the kind of offensively minded spirit that the German commanders aimed to Foster foreign given orders to attack a platoon would split up into four squads while closing in on the objective the machine gun team would lead the advance while additional machine guns in the rear provided fire support achieving fire superiority was of the utmost importance so if the advancing squads came under Fire the lead machine gun team would deploy to augment the covering fire from the rear The Riflemen however were to keep pushing forward as quickly and for as long as possible rather than to help achieve fire superiority fire and maneuver tactics which would often see several squads covering each other would see large formations LeapFrog on enemy-held territory once the squad reached a threshold of around 100 meters from the enemy positions the squad leader would determine the place of penetration in the enemy line and Order his men to focus fire if possible several squads would attack simultaneously in this way from various directions to further overwhelm the opponent and spread out their defensive fire once suppressed the squad leader and The Rifleman would assault the penetration Point With Grenades and bayonets to overcome the remaining enemy strong points similarly whenever a squad found themselves on the defensive the men would form up around their machine gun team which would optimally have several secluded spots from which to fire on an advancing enemy the mg34 and mg-42's high rates of fire were perfectly suited to suppress and bludgeon and enemy assault while the rest of the squad would focus their fire on any Targets that had managed to evade the hail of bullets should the enemy manage to survive this Onslaught the vermox training dictated that a squad launched a head-on counter-attack to Route any remaining opponents these tactics would prove highly successful in the early years of the war and due to only having incurred limited casualties many squads could benefit from presence of Veteran ncos and officers of previous campaigns but casualties would rise in a dramatic fashion as the fighting dragged on and soon the Vermont would disband entire units and settle for squads at times made up of only five or six men by 1944 the German Army could only afford to maintain some full-strength veteran units While most infantry squads in the west were made up of inexperienced and undertrained soldiers as well as foreign Fighters with a limited understanding of the German language however these otherwise debilitating obstacles did not equate to a devastating loss of military effectiveness in fact most German infantry continued to be combat effective right up until the end of the war moreover the introduction of the stg-44 the world's first assault rifle somewhat compensated for the loss in Manpower while the mass-produced and easy to use Panzer Faust greatly augmented German anti-tank capabilities however none of these developments proved sufficient to turn the tide of the war and soon the Vermont's offensive Spirit was flipped into a desperate defense as the Allies closed in on the German Homeland at the start of the second world war the Vermont had managed to rebuild the German Army to its former glory its new infantry squads were modeled after tried and tested ideas from the previous war and equipped with some of the most powerful machine guns in existence this proved to be a highly successful combination in the early years of the war in which German military prowess outclassed its enemies on various fronts however as time dragged on and casualties Rose the Vermont was forced to downgrade its units and find increasingly desperate ways to retain combat Effectiveness while the far more numerous allies continued to replenish and augment its men with the latest weapons and equipment\",\n",

had turned into a route of Epic Proportions with the Greeks not only pushing the Italians out of their country but following them into italian-occupied Albania the British soon allied with the ascendant Greeks and the Italians found themselves brutalized by the Tommy's on one side and the hellenics on the other Italy's attempts at Conquest had turned into a dumpster fire and Hitler feared The Blaze would spread his worry exploded into outright Fury when Yugoslavia reluctantly joined the Axis powers only to implode into an anti-fascist coup that the fearer took as a personal affront rolling up their sleeves and dragging the Italians and hungarians along with them the Germans swept into Yugoslavia in a blowout Invasion subjugating the Rogue axis Ally in less than a month meanwhile other German troops trudged into Greece bailing out the beleaguered Italians and conquering the entire country the British sent an expeditionary Force to shore up the Greek defense but even their combined strength couldn't stand up to the Nazi counter-attack and its Italian Hangers On the Allies withdrew to Crete trying to make the island a Mediterranean stronghold but the German falshem Yeager cracked the defense on May 20th 1941 in a historic butyric Victory the German Triumph at krieged was a costly Affair to the point that General Kurt student who commanded the falsham Yeagers would dub Crete the graveyard of the German paratroopers Germany had well and truly saved Italy's panchetta but even as the dust of battle settled there were some in Germany who questioned the wisdom of coming to Mussolini's rescue Lenny Riefenstahl the Nazi propagandist influential filmmaker and close friend of Hitler recalled the fuhrer stewing over the possibility that if the Italians hadn't attacked Greece and needed our help the war would have taken a different course we could have anticipated the Russian cold by weeks and conquered Leningrad and Moscow there could have been no Stalingrad Hitler's assessment of operation Barbarossa is disputed by modern historians Richard Hooker Jr a U.S army analyst argues that the delayed timetable did not prevent the troops from advancing to Moscow between late June and mid-august especially given their morale was at an all-time high following the victories in Yugoslavia and Greece David glance a military history Professor believes that Germany's Balkan campaign actually helped Barbarossa by discrediting Soviet intelligence reports of an imminent Invasion however the popular belief is that Germany's support of Italy hindered Barbarossa resulting in the first of many defeats for the Third Reich the answer to this eternal question may never be found lost in the fog of History [Music] Operation Barbarossa initially lived up to its promise The Joint Invasion by Nazi Germany and Italy with support from Romania Hungary and Finland saw the axis make their typical quick gains and seize much territory even as Hitler constantly changed their strategic goals but the invasion hit a major stumbling block at the first battle of Smolensk which left the triumphant Army group Center severely debilitated High command elected to order the center to hold and diverted other forces to reinforce the push into Ukraine and against Leningrad Kiev would soon fall and the axis spent the ensuing months fighting their way to Victory across the USSR except for the grinding sieges at Leningrad and Sebastopol buoyed by their success the axis made a rush for Moscow only to grind to a halt just outside the capital suburbs burned out from their rapid Advance bloodied by dogged Soviet resistance and with the Soviets gearing up for a counter-offensive the axis could do nothing but wait for the Communists response a response that would throw the Germans back from Moscow even as they held on to their other conquests but as the Germans licked their wounds a new foe was brought into the war the bombing of Pearl Harbor saw the United States declare war on the Empire of Japan and honoring its treaty obligations Nazi Germany declared war on the U.S soon thereafter Germany was well and truly being pushed closer and closer to the edge due to the logistical issues mostly lack of oil the Germans could only focus on one Army group for their 1942 offensive Hitler and his generals began planning for the next phase of their offensive against the Soviet Union aiming South with an eye towards seizing the Reds oil fields during a planning session Hitler grimly informed the commanders of army group South that if I do not get the oil of my cop and grozny then I must end this war their rush into the USSR had well and truly stretched the Germans then and the Nazi summer offensive including the Battle of Stalingrad represented A desperate Hail Mary if the Nazis could capture the Soviet oil fields they could retain the initiative and grind the hated Communists into the Dust but desperation bred under preparedness and the soldiers who marched to capture the oil were neither ready for the mountainous terrain nor equipped for Winter fighting these Soviets proved dogged as ever especially at Stalingrad leading to the Germans being encircled by a Soviet counter-attack that wiped out the sixth Army Army group South was ultimately forced back into Ukraine by the Soviets with the Germans in the Caucasus barely managing an escape during Operation Barbarossa failure led to finger-pointing with General Franz halder the chief of staff blaming the diversion of troops to the Ukraine for the inability to capture Moscow however holder's argument neglected the fact that Napoleon was able to occupy Moscow during his own invasion of Russia and history may have repeated itself had the Vermont reached the city even so this was not a Napoleonic War of Conquest but a war of annihilation these Soviets had to be exterminated their land and resources claimed for Nazi Germany Hitler in many regards picked the worst possible fight he chose to throw his men against a cornered animal with unbelievable reserves of Manpower and Industrial capacity and his men were mauled foreign but there was some sunshine and sauerkraut for the Germans during this period of the war as Italy proved a millstone around Hitler's neck and the Soviets stood firm the kriegs marina was experiencing another huge period of success which German submariners dubbed the second happy time this period saw wolf packs prowl the Atlantic and feed on American shipping with impunity U-boats sailed from the coast of France all the way to the Caribbean America's official entry into the war did little to help as the U.S Navy still shaking off its mothballs following years of complacency was totally unprepared for the kriegs marina and cargo ships were sent out with woefully inadequate escorts that could do little in the face of a ravening wolf pack ironically it was far safer to go it alone during the Happy Time as single ships were far less attractive targets it was not just American ships that the Germans were busily preying upon from 1941 to 42 as they racked up their mixed record on enemies without the Nazis made Moves against who they saw as enemies Within Hitler had come to power on a wave of anti-Semitism and pseudoscientific racism one of the crucial War aims of his unprovoked attacks was the creation of laban's Realm new territories cleared out of unter mention that his Aryan Superman could live in make fertile and fill with their offspring but laban's realm also had to be made within Germany's borders and on top of Hitler's list of undesirables were the Jewish population anti-semitic laws had been made on the books for some time but it was here that the Holocaust went from a political goal of displacement to a national effort of industrial Slaughter the Nazis busy themselves with cramming Jews into ghettos the largest of which in Warsaw piled almost half a million Jews a full third of warsaw's population into less than three percent of the city's area but this imprisonment was not enough for the Nazis and at the wanzai conference in early 1942 the die was cast for extermination SS death squads followed Barbarossa shooting Jews and other unter mention or else Outsourcing the cruelty to Soviet citizens eager to show their fealty to their new overlords or engage in some simple but murderous banditry extermination camps were planned and built furnaces fueled by the bodies of the murdered the Nazis were careful to document and preserve innumerable pieces of evidence of what they'd done confident that theirs was the beginning of a new world order and their descendants would gratefully and gleefully watch how Hitler's Germany had purified the world but it was this record that would see the Nazis at Nuremberg hoisted by their own petards but that is for another video 1941 and 1942 were days of Triumph frustration and blood for Nazi Germany as Italy dragged them into the Greek Balkan and African Myers the Soviets proved remarkably unwilling to let the Nazis steamroll them and American convoys proved tempting targets the foundations of Hitler's downfall were steadily being laid the offensives in Russia sapped men and materiel ultimately not meeting their objectives before these Soviets could push the Germans out news of their atrocities would also spread inspiring some Jews to resist and the Nazis meticulous records would soon prove their undoing these were the last good years for Hitler's Germany a final gasp of conquest and Glory [Music] foreign

the Airfield and sever the Paris sherborg Railway line if possible the third infantry division would also support a potential assault on Khan with British forces advancing from sword Beach like their British comrades in arms the Canadian Invasion force would face units of the German 716th static Infantry Division which had positioned themselves in pill boxes and fortified houses in various fishing

re-armed German Nation had conquered nearly all of its neighbors in a series of shockingly quick campaigns their success would soon be attributed to a revolutionary new strategy which journalists and propagandists would call Blitzkrieg although it is commonly used today to refer to the overall way in which the Third Reich waged War the term never referred to an all-encompassing military Doctrine and Blitzkrieg tactics were far from the only reason for Germany's early success before we continue I'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video War Thunder a free to play online military vehicle

speed and effectiveness of Nazi Germany's new war machine was demonstrated for the first time in full during their 1939 invasion of Poland in planning for the invasion one of the main concerns of Hitler and German High command the okw was the looming threat of France on their western border dividing their forces and engaging in a two-front war was out of the question so German planners concluded that they could only hope to win by destroying the Polish Army as rapidly as possible before turning all of their attention West to achieve this the okw relied on the Prussian strategy of decisive maneuver which aimed for Rapid surprise attacks followed by encirclements of retreating enemies this proven tactic was supported by new ideas about mechanized Warfare developed During the interwar period most importantly the concept of the Panzer Division While most armies at the time employed tanks primarily as support for their infantry the Vermont concentrated their armored units into separate divisions and placed them front and center in their operations the doctrines surrounding the use of these Panzer divisions as fast-moving armored spearheads would later form the strategy that we now call Blitzkrieg but at the time it was less of a distinct idea and more of a continuation of a tried and true Prussian Doctrine while armored units were very effective during the invasion of Poland punching through Enemy Lines with the help of infantry and luftwaffe dive bombers their presence was far from the decisive factor in the campaign's success out of the 53 divisions in the German invasion Force only six were Panzer divisions while another four were motorized the vast majority of the fighting in Poland was done by conventional infantry with horses playing an important role rather than widespread mechanization or brilliant tactics the Vermont's greatest advantage in its first campaign was arguably the Strategic weakness of the Polish Army diplomatic meddling and false promise from their Western allies had interfered with their mobilization leaving polish forces deployed in a thin line too close to their long border with Germany and Slovakia this left the poles especially vulnerable to flanking and encirclement and by the time the Soviets invaded from the East the fate of Poland was sealed in less than a month the Polish military had been crushed between the armies of Germany and the Soviet Union and the government had been forced into exile in April of the following year the Germans set their sights on Denmark and Norway in order to deny the British access to the Baltic secure their iron ore Supply from neutral Sweden and gain access to Norwegian heavy water facilities the invasion of Denmark was met with almost no resistance and was over in less than six hours making it by far the fastest campaign Germany would ever complete Norway did not fare much better while the Panzer divisions played a relatively minor part in the Polish campaign the invasion of Norway would see these new armored tactics take on a very different role specifically a non-existent one as the campaign did not involve any armored units instead the conquest of Norway was accomplished through an amphibious assault utilizing Naval Air air airborne and ground forces in a coordinated well-timed surprise attack to minimize their disadvantages against the Royal Navy the Germans planned the operation during April when harsh weather on the North Sea would hinder enemy ships and reduce visibility giving their Invasion forces a better chance to safely reach their targets as the kriegs marina held off the Royal Navy at Sea infantry units captured several key ports while paratroopers were deployed to Sea's key airfields this sudden and decisive attack caught the Norwegians and their allies off guard although it would be two months before the Norwegian Army would capitulate the nation's capital and most of its major cities fell to the Germans amphibious Invasion within the first 24 hours the invasion of Norway was not the only important role that the kriegs marina played during the first two years of the war although Germany was blockaded immediately after the war started the Germans also simultaneously began their Convoy raiding campaign u-30 for example sank the British ocean liner SS Athena mere hours after the war declaration the British soon adopted the convoy system and formed anti-submarine hunting groups based around aircraft carriers this would soon backfire as the HMS Arc Royal Britain's modern aircraft carrier was almost sunk two weeks after the war declaration and another British carrier the HMS courageous would actually be sunk three days later German submarines would even infiltrate the British base at scapa flow and sink a battleship the HMS Royal Oak with the adoption of wolf pack tactics the U-Boat Fleet had immense success sinking millions of tons of shipping even surface Raiders like the Admiral hipper and the Admiral Shearer had success attacking British convoys this period of early success would be nicknamed The Happy Time by German sailors a month after the invasion of Norway the Germans finally ended the eight-month phony War by launching their Western offensive into the Benelux and France the German plan relied heavily on fast-moving armored and motorized units to exploit weakness in the Allied defenses on May 10th the German Army launched a surprise attack on the neutral countries of the Benelux overwhelming Force combined with daring Airborne assaults quickly managed to break the back of the Dutch Army while the belgians supported by both France and Britain buckled in the face of Hitler's finest Panzer formations rather than attacking the enemy head-on fast-moving German units outmaneuvered their Allied counterparts to cut off their supply lines and disrupt reinforcements it was these armored spearheads that drove through the Arden avoiding the imagino line and encircling the British expeditionary forces around Dunkirk the British were only spared from Disaster by a daring evacuation with the close support of the luftwaffe the invading forces were able to wreak havoc on Allied Logistics with devastating results the Germans also took advantage of the fact that the French deployed their tanks evenly across the front line which allowed them to mask their panzers into concentrated attacks a great number of France's dreaded Char B1 battle tanks in many ways Superior to contemporary German tanks wound up being abandoned across the battlefield after running out of fuel with their impressive armor barely scratched German Logistics on the other hand functioned very smoothly with a report from Panzer group kleist asserting that there was not a single Supply crisis that his group was unable to resolve this was in large part thanks to France's infrastructure which included a large quantity of gas stations the steady supply of fuel allowed the Panzer divisions to race ahead and attempt the far-ranging encirclement Maneuvers that would ultimately play a major role in the rapid destruction of the French army the stable supply lines the Germans enjoyed during the Western offensive were absolutely critical for continuing their fast-paced armored Maneuvers without them the Germans rapid advances could not be sustained after Dunkirk it only took the Germans three more weeks to conquer the rest of France the fall of France also had the added benefit of providing the Germans with Atlantic Naval bases which would contribute to the success of their U-Boat fleets meanwhile the Germans would establish the Vichy French government in the South the incredible success of the French campaign cemented a popular image of the Vermont as an Unstoppable machine capable of rolling over its enemies with overwhelming speed and strength even the German leadership was largely taken in by the notion of their invincibility despite the fact that it was blatantly false the German war machine certainly had its strengths but it was far from Unstoppable as the failure of operation Barbarossa would later reveal the consistent Breakneck pace of the Vermont's operations led many outside observers to conclude that Hitler and his generals had devised a completely new way of Waging War however far from a clear doctrine that had guided all of their European campaigns the idea of Blitzkrieg was if anything a Loosely defined strategy in the minds of the okw multiple German officers like Heinz scudarian and Ernst volkheim had extensively written on Armored Warfare during the interwar years the Civil War in Spain proved to be an especially useful testing ground for these tactics with the Germans deploying tanks and air support in Combined arms tactics it was these strategies that would later be refined during the campaigns in Poland the Benelux and France after the fall of France the United Kingdom remained the sole great power opposing the Germans the Germans had no intention to keep the war going but under leadership of Winston Churchill the British were not open to a negotiation thus the Germans began a mass campaign to achieve air superiority over England in order to force the British to the negotiating table at first the Germans targeted Naval convoys ports RAF airfields infrastructure and Industrial centers still the British continued to resist so Hitler ordered the okw to plan an invasion of Britain Operation Sea Lion as a contingency measure aided by radar the RAF continued to inflict heavy losses on the luftwaffe and the Germans began to bomb civilian centers in an effort to terrorize the British public into submission unfortunately for the Germans this had the complete opposite effect galvanizing the British public against them eventually heavy losses forced the Germans into nighttime raids which essentially meant relinquishing their attempt to obtain air superiority that being said these raids would go on until mid-1941 and would be nicknamed by the press as the blitz a term that remains in British popular consciousness even if Europe was already in the midst of Another World War German diplomats were nonetheless still hard at work while the air battle was raging over Great Britain German foreign minister Joachim Von ribentrop and diplomats from Italy and Japan met in Berlin to formalize their Alliance by signing The tripartite Pact in these subsequent months Hungary Romania and Slovakia would also join The Pact followed by Bulgaria and Croatia in 1941. there is no denying that the Vermont had achieved a series of remarkable victories during the first year of the war effectively conquering Europe at Breakneck speeds while it can be tempting to explain all of these early conquests as the result of Blitzkrieg the reality is far more nuanced the Vermont's earliest operations were carefully planned taking full advantages of their enemies weaknesses German troops were fresh and well supplied by a smooth Logistics Network relying on the kind of aggressive surprise attacks that had served the Prussian Army's well for decades these advantages saw the Third

paratroopers of the British 6th Airborne Division they have been tasked with securing two bridges over the Khan canal and the river worn on the far East flank of the scheduled Allied Landings in Normandy within 15 minutes the assault teams managed to completely overwhelm these small German garrisons guarding the bridges and dig in as they await the arrival of the rest of the division the bulk of the sixth Airborne was set to land just east of the river orange where they were to destroy five bridges over the river Dev and silence the mareville gun battery overlooking sword Beach however in a near replay of the American drop for visibility and navigational errors caused the paratroopers to be scattered all across the Norman Countryside fortunately the area of operations lacked the thick bokage that would come to haunt The Americans making it far easier for the paratroopers to swiftly link up in large groups to the east designated units set out to destroy the bridges over the Deep River while a small group of 160 peras out of a plant 600 proceed to assault the heavily defended Maryville battery to the north the fierceness of the following battle depletes nearly half of the

kilometers from the seaside town of wistram to Sant Amba Sumer this beach was to be the Eastern flank of Operation Overlord swords significance lay in its proximity to the city of Khan which was a major road Hub located just 12 kilometers from the beach the British third infantry division had been ordered to lead the assault on sword Beach and if possible liberate Khan before the end of the day secondary objectives were awarded to the elite units of the first special service Brigade whose men were ordered to link up with the Canadians landing on Juno Beach just off to the West as well as relieve the embattled paratroopers of the sixth Airborne Division to the southeast opposing the British Invasion force was the German 716th static Infantry Division as a first line of defense its men had littered the beach with minefields and obstacles of all kinds beyond that the Brits would have to Brave a series of resistance nests which stretched from the coastline all the way to Khan the most notable amongst these were two formidable Inland strong points codenamed Morris and Hillman these veritable fortresses were armed with heavy artillery anti-tank weaponry and machine gun emplacements and were perfectly positioned to block and Advance on Khan however the Germans real Ace in the Hole came in the form of the 21st Panzer Division stationed near Khan their presence in the area presented the defender's best chance of forcing the British troops back into the channel as such it was imperative for the success of the entire Invasion that the third infantry division get off the beach as quickly as possible the citizens of Khan are still recovering from the impact of the preliminary bombardment when they first wave of landing craft and amphibious duplex drive or DD tanks set off toward the shoreline with most of the German resistance nests still intact the Vanguard of the third infantry division face strong initial opposition several landing craft and vehicles are Hit

Beach hours pass but luckily for the British the expected German counter-attack fails to materialize to the South the frustrated men of the 21st Panzer Division idle uselessly as they await explicit orders from the fuhrer to attack the beachhead the fuhrer however is still soundly asleep as the bulk of the invasion Force finally begins moving off the beach on the Eastern flank the men of the number four Commando unit have managed to clear out Westrom while just to the South the first special service Brigade are the first to make contact with the beleaguered paratroopers at The Icon canal

but the latter's defenses prove far more formidable than anticipated fighting at Hillman continues well into the evening obstructing any further advances in that area to make matters worse at four o'clock the 21st Panzer Division finally arrives on the front line to begin their counter-attack its tanks strike right in between the British and Canadian lines but the timely appearance of Allied armor causes heavy casualties on the charging panzers despite these losses the Germans press the attack and at seven o'clock some surviving elements managed to reach the coast these depleted units

before nightfall by midnight on June 6th the British Invasion Force had succeeded in achieving about half of its objectives at sword close to 29 000 men had come ashore at the cost of around 1 000 casualties the sixth Airborne on its part had secured a beachhead on the Eastern Bank of the Orem while blocking the way for the Germans to reinforce the defense of the beach crucially though the British had not been able to capture Khan on the first day a failure that would prove extremely costly for the Allies as it allowed the Germans time to reinforce their line with several Elite Panzer divisions the Norman City would not finally be liberated until July 19th at Gold Beach around 24 500 men occupied the largest Allied beachhead of the entire Invasion at the relatively merciful cost of 400 casualties the 50th Infantry Division had shattered the German defensive positions opposing them and connected its front with the Canadians at Juno Beach although the Brits had failed to contact the Americans and capture bayu they stood poised to liberate the weakly defended City on the following day if British casualties on D-Day were less Grievous than Allied planners had anticipated their

dedicated to finding a way to break the stalemate of the Western Front the committee is brainstorming eventually led to the creation of Little Willy the first working tank in the world little more than a proof of concept Willie was a metal pillbox on tracks that had a difficult time traversing trenches and rough terrain the very thing the landship committee needed to do but Willie's creation gave the landship committee momentum momentum that led to the creation of the hmls or his Majesty's land shift centipede better known as mother mother was the first tank to feature the rhomboidal design that came to Mark British tanks of the first World War and at field testing in January of 1915 mother easily conquered trenches elevation swampy terrain and any other challenges that the landship committee threw its way the British army ordered 100 of the new vehicles in February 1916 calling their new weapon a tank for the first time the tank Mark 1 was little different from mother featuring the same rhomboidal chassis and integrating two six-pounder guns inside sponsons during production however it was discovered that there were not adequate supplies of six-pounder guns leaving half of the Mark 1 tanks to be armed with additional machine guns in their sponsons instead the half that received the six Pounders would be dubbed male tanks while those with the machine guns were considered female of both sexes saw action from the Western Front to the Sands of Gaza ushering in the era of armored combat across the globe as the war continued British designers were not content to sit on their Laurels innovating new iterations of Tanks to bash the Bosh harder the Mark V was the first tank in the series to require only one driver whereas previous models required a full crew of four to maneuver around the battlefield a rear cab was also added for the Tank's Commander to survey the battlefield as well as a rear machine gun for close in defense but for all its progress the early Mark V had a potentially fatal flaw poor ventilation led to instances of carbon monoxide poisoning as the crew choked on the fumes of their engine despite its difficulties the Mark V saw action throughout the final battles of the first world war and was deployed in the interwar Years by white forces during the Russian Civil War at the beginning of the interwar years Vickers Armstrong found success with their second attempt at a tank design the Vickers medium tank originally classified as a light tank the Mark 1 was an operational but highly flawed design the axles were notably weak making them highly susceptible to damage and meaning the wheels were likely to Simply fall off but most critically the mark 1's 6.25 millimeter armor provided no protection whatsoever from enemy fire despite this glaring failure at basic tank design the Mark 1 was put into service with an order for 200 of this model and its Mark II sibling with thicker armor and an improved suspension and drive system the Mark II was a vastly superior design the tank brought a new style of turning to the Vickers line with a gear shift and steering system that essentially cut engine power to the left or right tracks in order to accomplish Maneuvers the tank rotating around the now idle tracks to reorient itself both the Mark II and its Mark 1 sibling were phased out of service by 1938 but managed to squeeze in some action in the moment campaign of 1935 as the British sought to end a campaign of banditry by indigenous tribes of modern day Pakistan continuing the preeminence of Vickers Armstrong in British tank design the cruiser tank was the first in a new breed of armored vehicle For the First Time The Familiar tank layout was put into practice with the crew compartment in the front turret in the center and engine mounted in the rear designed to war department specifications requiring it to be simple in layout and cheap in construction the six-man Cruiser tank Mark 1 brought the never-before-seen addition to a fully motorized turret no longer was the Tank's aim dependent on Manpower the first modern tank would have a short service life supplanting the light tanks in 1938 and seeing action in France and Belgium at the outbreak of the second world war however by 1941 the rearmament of the Heather II complacent British Army was in full swing and the cruiser tank Mark 1 would give way to a new breed of armor including its late successor the Mark VI Cruiser tank dubbed the Crusader thank you foreign much heavier than its contemporaries the Crusader featured a double hole armored in plate between 40 to 51 millimeter thick and depending on the specimen brought a two to six pound gun onto the field the Crusaders saw extensive action in North Africa providing the backbone of Britain's armor in the decisive battles of El Alamein and to Brook despite revealing itself to be something of a finicky machine in desert conditions earning a reputation for unreliability 5300 of these temperamental tract Terrors were built from 1941 to 1949 and at time of writing 21 rest in museums and private collections around the globe the Crusader was the product of Britain's Grant rearmament campaign a campaign that began after the disastrous defense of France a late addition to the British tank lineup the Mark 8 Cromwell roared onto the scene during Operation Overlord fighting to liberate Europe from Nazi occupation armed with a 75 millimeter main gun and sporting 100 millimeter thick armor The Cromwell was faster better armed and more durable than the American Shermans that rolled into The Fray alongside it though tank to tank it was found to be inferior to the Tigers and Panthers the Nazis deployed the tank wouldn't rest after victory in Europe however as cromwell's joined the British elements of the UN forces in Korea and the tank would serve as a basis for later British tank designs finally entering retirement in 1955 after 11 years on the battlefield a direct answer to the question what do we do about the Tigers and Panthers the comet was a fast decently agile anti-decently armored tank with a key feature its 77 millimeter high velocity Cannon capable of killing the German big cats just over 1 000 comets were produced and these cat Killers would join other Cruiser tanks in the post-war battlefields of the Middle East and Pacific with a number continuing to be deployed by the Burmese military as part of their rearmament and rethinking the war office decided on a delineation of tank rolls to see them through the war Cruiser tanks intended to fight other armored vehicles were separated from infantry tanks purpose built to travel alongside and provide fire support to soldiers on foot Waltzing into the battlefield alongside British infantry the Infantry tank Mark II or Matilda blazed to the trail for infantry tanks on the battlefields of the second world war clad in armor up to 78 millimeters in thickness and sporting a two pounder gun and new check air-cooled machine guns replacing older Vickers water cooled models the Matilda was a durable tank well suited to protecting and providing fire support to Tommy's from the Sands of Eritrea to the roads of the European liberation one thousand matildas would make their way to the Soviet Union to help beat back Operation Barbarossa and the Tank's final user was Australia whose citizen military force or militia retired the tank in 1955. for all its good qualities the Matilda proved costlier than anticipated to produce leading to a redesign focused on improving unit cost as much as design features the result was the Valentine the most ubiquitous of Britain's infantry tanks over 6 800 of these infantry tanks were produced all featuring an enlarged turret basket for easier ergonomics and a larger crew of four the Valentine was Timeless seeing action from the Battle of Madagascar through the 1963 Cyprus crisis a notable variant of the Valentine was the New Zealand 2cs which replaced the usual two-pounder gun with a three-inch howitzer two CS Valentines saw action in the battle of the green islands where operation square peg in a daring reconnaissance in force by kiwi and Yankee troops whether it was named for the wartime prime minister or the first Duke of Marlborough the Infantry tank mark IV or Churchill was a more defensively minded design intended for use in static defense operations to this end the Churchill was thickly armored with a glasses of 102 millimeters in thickness and its turret featured a powerful six-pounder gun this British Behemoth was rushed into production straight off the drawing board and caused almost immediate problems befitting its design and nature the tank was incredibly slow and its welded turret was soon replaced by a more efficiently produced cast model The Churchill joined its infantry tank cousins on fields of battle from Burma to France ending its days in battle against the Korean People's Army during the Korean War our first Cold War era design and direct descendant of the Comet the Centurion tank was built to be the next Generation cat killer ready to go toe-to-toe with the finest of the panzers unfortunately it rolled onto the field of battle in 1945 too late to fulfill its intended purpose armed with either a 17 or 20 pounder main Cannon and armored up to 152 millimeters thick the Centurion sure would have given the Tigers and Panthers a challenge despite showing up too late for its first war the Centurion remains in service today and over its career has been exported to India Pakistan Israel Sweden Denmark and Austria among others the end of the second world war did not mean the end of Britain having two counter-armored threats the dawn of the Cold War meant the war office shifting its focus from cat killing to Breaking the metal fists of the Soviet bear to this end a new cruiser-style tank was deployed in 1967 the chieftain the chieftain sported a 120 millimeter main gun and turret armor 350 millimeters thick 1896 Chieftains have been built to date with 960 sold on the international arms Market the majority of these were bought by Iran who fielded them against Iraq in their conflict from 1980 to 1988. the Challenger is a modernization of the chieftain integrating composite armor for the first time it also added thermal imaging and range-finding Suites for the 120 millimeter main gun which was sometimes loaded with depleted uranium rounds however these improvements were balanced by accusations of unreliability and difficulty performing maintenance in the field despite these concerns the Challenger saw extensive action during the Gulf War and it was here that a challenger performed a 5 100 meter shot sniping an Iraqi tank and setting a record that wasn't challenged until 2022 the Challenger would retire in 2001 replaced by the Challenger 2. the next evolution of the Challenger tank faced quite a few challenges in its development originally conceived in 1988 designs for the Challenger 2 were continuously rejected until 1991. when an interaction was finally deemed acceptable to enter production 250 subcontractors worked to get the first Challengers operational and their work rolled off the assembly line after two years of production only to utterly fail its test runs the Challenger 2 would finally enter service in 1998 a full decade after being initially proposed this challenging tank features similar arms and Armament to its predecessor but notably has an increased operational range the tank has seen extensive action in the war on terror and despite its troubled history continues to be a Mainstay of the British army resisting efforts to replace it as early as 2002 and as late as 2015. the nation that invented the tank has perhaps the most difficulty implementing their creation between shifting arms doctrines and the challenges of design and testing Britain has had a number of unusual

Transport planes carrying the American 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions made its way toward the kutanta peninsula the elite paratroopers were entrusted with the crucial task of Paving the way for the Seabourn forces landing at Utah Beach just after Dawn the 101st would secure the causeways between the towns of Saul martal duverival and pupaville while the 82nd would capture the crossroads at the town of salmer iglese and secure the vital Bridges across the maraday river at Chef de Paul and La fierre Manor however things go awry almost immediately as thick Inland cloud cover and intense ground fire complicated things for the pilots in the resulting chaos most paratroopers miss their Drop Zones entirely as they are scattered all across the peninsula those who land safely nonetheless manage to quickly form makeshift units as they make their way to the nearest objective in most cases the confused German Defenders are quickly overwhelmed Saul mayor igles becomes the first French town to be liberated at around 4 30 a.m as men of the 82nd dig in for the expected counter-attack at the LA fierre Manor and Chef dupaul Bridges to the West the bulk of the 101st due east in the meantime are in the process of clearing the five causeways to The Landing Beach where the invasion Force anchored just offshore is about to make its approach foreign Target was a five kilometer stretch of flat Sandy Beach just east of the Airborne Drop Zones codenamed Utah Beach on board of the invasion Fleet were the men of the fourth infantry division their objective was to establish a beachhead approximately five kilometers wide and eight kilometers deep with the ultimate goal to isolate the kutanta peninsula and capture the deep water Port of cherborg the first step in achieving this objective would be to break through the defensive position of the German 709th static Infantry Division before advancing Inland on the five main road exits besides flooding the nearby Farm Fields The Defenders had littered Utah beach with three lines of obstacles consisting of steel spikes and mined wooden posts as well as an array of anti-tank obstacles the Utah sector was covered by nine resistance nests or wiederschtan's nesten which were manned by platoon strength garrisons totaling about 700 troops at 5 50 the fleet commences its bombardment of known German positions along the coast meanwhile 270 bombers close in to further soften up the German strong points however hindered by poor visibility and anxious not to hit the invasion Force few Pilots managed to hit their targets at 6 30 hours the first wave of 20 landing craft carrying part of the eighth regiment approaches the Beach's two sectors Uncle red and Tara green they are supposed to have landed behind a Vanguard of amphibious DD or duplex Drive tanks of the 70th tank battalion the 70th tanks however are struggling to advance in the face of heavy headwinds and Wade ashore late around 6 45 AM luckily for the Infantry German resistance is lighter than expected and besides some small arms fire most casualties on the beach fall victim to artillery fire and mines as it turns out the strong swell that morning pulled the landing craft a mile or 1.5 kilometers Southward to a sector less well defended than the previously designated Landing site despite this Good Fortune incoming artillery fire covering the various Beach exits continues to cause casualties and hamper the advance throughout the early morning hours a few miles Inland paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division resolved the issue as they conduct a set of Daring assaults to silence the German batteries at oldie and braycor Manor with these guns neutralized the men of the fourth infantry division managed to overrun the remaining German Beach defenses and by 8 30 hours are ready to begin their Advance up the causeways around noon men of the eighth regiment make contact with elements of the 101st Airborne Division at pupaville further Inland at Saul Marie dumal the regiment's Third Battalion prepares for a battle but finds the town already liberated by Troopers of the 506th parachute Infantry Regiment who had cleared it in close quarters fighting earlier that day the Swift and mostly painless advance of the eighth regiment is finally ordered to a halt at the end of the day at the crossroads at leforge some 10 kilometers Inland meanwhile men from the 12th and 22nd regiments Landing in follow-up waves moved to secure the northern and Northwestern flanks of the beachhead until they too penetrate around 10 kilometers into german-held territory by the end of the day the Utah operation had been a success the fourth infantry division had achieved nearly all of its objectives in return for just 197 casualties a number far lower than had been anticipated the Airborne divisions had suffered more heavily during their chaotic nighttime drop but they too had managed to achieve the majority of their primary objectives within 24 hours the Americans had established a firm beachhead on the kutanta peninsula through a mixture of exemplary skill and sheer luck some 23 250 men and 1700 Vehicles were ashore with countless more to follow in the days weeks and months to come these fortunes however would be in short supply for the American forces set to land further east foreign [Music] 15 kilometers to the east of Utah Beach a group of 225 elite soldiers from the second ranger battalion under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James Rudder are headed towards the protruding Cliffs of the Punta duhok the Rangers were entrusted with the daunting task of scaling the 30 meter high Cliffs to prevent its artillery battery from pummeling the American Invasion beaches once on top the Americans would have to fight their way through a series of defensive works and obstacles manned by men from the 716th static Infantry Division in order to reach the gun emplacements things don't start out well for rudder's men on D-Day his troops are scheduled to land at 6 30 but due to a navigational mishap they don't reach the beach until 10 past 7. the alerted Germans greet the Rangers with small arms fire grenades and even rocks as the latter begin making their way up the cliff by 7 30 hours the first exhausted Rangers have made their way to the top to find a moon-like landscape of deep craters created by preliminary bombardment in a wild and frenzied scene Rutter's men stormed the emplacements only to find that the guns are not there fears that their sacrifice had been for nothing are soon alleviated when a patrol finds that the guns are intact in a field just behind the puenta with their main objective completed the remaining Rangers dig in for the inevitable German counter-attack and wait to be relieved by The Invasion Force landing at the neighboring Omaha Beach foreign the Western end of Omaha Beach lay just about six kilometers to the east of puenta du Hawk and stretched all the way from the area around veryville sumera to the cliffs near Colleyville Sumer some eight kilometers to the east the most prominent characteristic of this wide and mostly Sandy Beach was a series of Bluffs which offered a commanding view over the coastline five natural draws between the Bluffs offered the only exits off the beach for vehicles and heavy Ordnance the Germans were well aware of the potential for a landing in the Omaha sector and had constructed an intricate web of obstacles and resistance nests to cover the approaches to the draws the beach itself had been littered with obstacles of all kinds soldiers disembarking in the shallows would first have to Traverse an array of mined stakes and iron frames as well as Hedgehog anti-tank obstacles barbed wire covered the sea wall and dunes further on while the draws were blocked off by minefields and concrete walls as well as remote controlled flamethrowers furthermore in order for soldiers in most sectors to even reach the draws they would have to cross the Shelf which was a roughly football field sized gap of open ground between the sea wall and the base of the Bluffs but to even get to that point the Americans would have to Brave a deadly and sophisticated set of resistance nests most of these strong points were hidden from sight camouflaged and placed at an angle to protect them from enemy fire the slight curve of the coastline also meant that resistance nests on both the eastern and western edges of the beach could provide interlocking fields of fire Across The Landing ground three additional resistance nests were positioned behind the Bluffs should the Invaders managed to break through in total the resistance nests in the Omaha sector were composed of eight big gun emplacements 35 pill boxes 18 anti-tank guns and 85 machine gun nests being the largest and the most well-defended of the two American beaches Allied command had assigned both the 29th Infantry Division as well as the veteran first Infantry Division to secure the Bluffs by 7 30 hours link up with the British forces advancing from Gold Beach at poor om Besson and securing an overall beachhead 26 kilometers wide and eight kilometers deep at 5 55 hours the preliminary air and Naval bombardment begins pounding the German positions but once again the bomber Pilots delay too long and end up missing their target entirely with the German defenses still intact the first wave begins to make its Approach at 6 30. some landing craft are hit as they close in on the beach and many soldiers are cut down to make matters worse almost all of the DD tanks that were supposed to land ahead of the Infantry have floundered in the rough Channel Waters after having been launched far too early at 5.5 kilometers from the shore within minutes companies a and F of the 116th Infantry Regiment landing at dog green and dog red are virtually wiped out however not every sector of Omaha is as well defended at dog white G company reaches the base of the beach within four minutes of Landing while at Fox red at the Far Eastern end of Omaha men from the 16th regiment make use of the cliffs in that sector to Shield themselves from enemy fire at around 8 o'clock a group of men under command of General Norman coda in the dog white sector managed to blow a hole in the barbed wire in the dog white sector and Advance up these steep Bluffs to take out wn-70 before moving on to clear the fear they'll draw to the east in the fox sector a group of soldiers led by Lieutenant Jimmy W Monteith similarly managed to fight their way up the exit and take out wn60 the majority of the troops near the draws are however still hopelessly pinned down and their sectors quickly become congested with the arrival of subsequent waves to make matters worse the incoming tide begins to shallow the wounded and the dead while slowly reducing the size of the beach even further sensing catastrophe a group of U.S Navy destroyers Brave enemy fire as they move in as close as 800 meters from the shoreline with their direct fire support eight German gun emplacements are knocked out providing enough of an opening for the ground troops to recontinue their Advance up the bluffs with the German defenses now being breached in several sectors the tide begins to turn in the Americans favor the assault teams on the Bluffs quickly Swing West and East to flank the remaining German positions while the other groups Advance on the towns of Fairville and Colleyville Sumer by the end of the day the Americans at Omaha had secured the Bluffs but the advance off the beach had only reached 1.5 kilometers Inland this precarious foothold on the Normandy Coast had come at the cost of over 4 000 U.S casualties still Omaha had been secured and the Germans lacked the strength to attempt to push the Americans back into the channel by Nightfall of June 6th 1944 it was clear that the American Landings had succeeded despite the initial chaos of the U.S Airborne Landings The efforts at Utah Beach had been nothing short of an astounding success Omaha Beach on the other hand had veered dangerously close to catastrophe yet here too the Americans had ultimately established a firm foothold that was only to expand in the days and weeks to come however relative success in the American sectors did not equate to the success of D-Day as a whole arguably the most important of all the landings on June 6th were taking place further to the east where British forces were attempting to capture the medieval city of Khan and prepare for a clash with the brunt of the German

by polarizing Cold War ideologies could peacefully reintegrate for the bundes fair West Germany's military reunification brought up its own issues first the absorption of East Germany's nazionale folks Army into the West German here swelled the bundesphere's total Personnel strength to around 600 000 making it the largest in Europe soon enough however this total plummeted as much of the staff members included Folk's Army conscripts and short-term volunteers who had completed their service officers of the fox Army above the rank of Colonel were fired and replaced by officers of the bundesfaire other folks are May officers were given two-year contracts under probation and in almost every case reduced in rank despite such restructuring some folks army officers were positive about their new role in the military reporting that the bundesfair allowed officers more authority to make decisions and that living conditions for regular Eastern soldiers increased dramatically reunification wasn't just an issue of personnel however along with the staff of the folks Army the bundesphere also inherited a vast stock of soviet-built Tanks trucks and guns numbering in the tens of thousands along with this they were saddled with a huge supply of Munitions including 350 000 tons of ammunition this soon presented a problem as this large stockpile of arms violated the Treaty of conventional forces in Europe which dictated arms and Personnel reductions with these restrictions in place Germany went about the process of reducing its Personnel from six hundred thousand to three hundred and seventy thousand and removing large swaths of military hardware from its doors armored vehicles fighting Jets and ships of the evokes army were dismantled scrapped or sold as Surplus to other nations with all of the downsizing and renovation of the bundesvere Cold War limitations on the bundesfair's capacity to manufacture and possess a wider array of conventional arms were lifted

made in March 2013 a total of 51 Eurocopter tiger UHS are in service with the here within the luftwaffe a variety of aircraft spanning multiple combat and support roles are in active service including the older panavia tornadoes and eurofighter typhoon combat aircraft in a post-cold war world the downsized bundesphere found itself with little need for large-scale conscription as a result the demand for conscripts fell and the military's heightened medical standards would keep the pool of potential recruits intentionally small by 2010 conscription had been shortened from 18 months to just six many military officials criticized the shortened conscription period and were concerned that full abolition of conscription would lead to recruitment shortages inevitably the reforms led to conscription being suspended by July 1st 2011. from here the Army transitioned into a professional Army of volunteer recruits in addition to the change in the number of personnel the Buddhist Fair underwent another important change in the composition of its staff beginning in 1993 women were permitted to serve as enlisted personnel and non-commissioned officers in the medical service and army bands over the years opportunities for women serving in the military have expanded further since 2001 women have been able to serve in all roles of the armed services without restriction in part thanks to differing requirements in physical performance which make up the military's Basic Fitness Test since 1996 Germany has had its own special forces the Commando shvezialkhafta or Special Forces command the Commando was formed after German citizens had to be rescued from the Rwandan Genocide by Belgian para Commandos in 1994. further reforms in October 2000 led to the establishment of the joint support service to concentrate military police and other supporting functions such as Logistics Supply and Communications under one command this became the fourth branch of the military a fifth Branch The Joint medical service was also created for the reorganized medical support within the military as of 2021 however the Minister of Defense published a plan to dissolve and reintegrate them into other military branches lastly there is a cyber and information space command the sixth Branch formed in 2017 and tasked with commanding the Cyber I.T military intelligence geoinformation and operative communication units of the Buddhist Fair throughout this period the bundesphere continued to be downsized even after suspending conscription in late 2004 the last unit of Naval bundes Marina tornadoes was disbanded with the entire Maritime combat role reassigned to the luftwaffe in September 2014 the bundesphere acknowledged chronic equipment problems that rendered its Armed Forces unable to deliver its defensive NATO promises dysfunctional weapon systems armored vehicles aircraft and Naval vessels were considered unfit for immediate service due to a neglect of Maintenance along with serious equipment and shortages of spare parts a major contributor to this downsizing can be assigned to Germany's heightened standards of practice with inspection standards often leading to equipment being designated as unfit over minor issues when it comes to bureaucracy reviewing conditions and the procurement of equipment throughout the military the German system is regarded as both slow and at times dysfunctional ordering replacement equipment can take years not only for tanks and ships but also for more mundane items it took Germany about a decade just to deliver new battle helmets for its forces one reason for these setbacks lies in laws that allow the losing bidder for a defense contract to challenge the decision in court which can stall a delivery for years the German military budget is renegotiated every fiscal year and money that has not been spent by the end of the year is essentially withdrawn this leads to delays and under financing as a result the bundes fair has somewhat of a reputation for wasting money when Ursula Van Der leyen was Minister of Defense between 2013 to 2019 she was accused of spending hundreds of millions of Euros on Consultants alone after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 Germany announced an increase in defense spending whether this was retaliatory or implemented as a measure of caution isn't certain but in May of 2015 defense spending was announced to be increased by 6.2 percent over the next five years in an effort to modernize the military the 2015 reform set a required strength of 185 000 soldiers plans were also announced to significantly expand the tank Fleet to a potential number of 328 order 131 more boxer armored personnel carriers increase the submarine Fleet and develop a new fighter jet to replace the Aging panavia tornado in May 2016 the German government announced it would spend 130 billion euros on new equipment by 2030 and add nearly 7 000 Soldiers by 2023 in the first major German military expansion since the end of the Cold War in 2020 Germany increased its military spending by 5.2 percent to 52.8 billion euros or 1.4 percent of the nation's GDP this was 28 higher than in 2011 when it was 1.2 percent of the GDP yet despite these extensive reforms a new crisis would evolve that meant today's German military spending would increase more than ever on February 24th 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine escalating the conflict which began in 2014. as Russian troops and armored divisions poured over the Border German Chancellor Olaf Schultz shocked the world when he announced that Germany would meet two percent of their GDP Benchmark required for NATO this vastly increased spending would make Germany the third largest military in terms of expenditure at around 76 billion euros leaving them only behind China and the United States additionally Schultz also assigned a special fund of over 100 billion euros on top of the annual budget to modernize and expand the bundesphere further one of the biggest costs involved in this budget will be for the brand new Lockheed Martin F-35 lightning II which would allow Germany's older model aircraft to be replaced in one major restructuring heavy transport helicopters armed drones warships submarines and air defense systems are also on the list of equipment to be replaced the bone despair also plans to use the expanded budget to enhance its research and development efforts particularly in coordination with Allied Nations such as France Spain the Netherlands and Israel while the German reserves have also seen increased applications since the start of the war it could take up to eight years for the bonus fair to muster its full potential the German government hoped that by 2031 the German military would have eight fully equipped brigades but not a single Brigade was a hundred percent ready for action in 2020. fully equipping the brigades is costly with the Army estimating that the price for a single Brigade being 5 billion euros responding to Schultz's announcement former military adviser to Angela Merkel Eric VOD remarked the bundesvere is in a very bad situation we have fewer tanks than Switzerland and fewer ships than the Netherlands the Air Force is a little bit better we have the smallest Navy in our history in that context this 100 billion is not a very high amount of money but we need it to strengthen our military capabilities by German standards a single combat ready division must consist of roughly 10 to 15 000 troops today the Germans do not have a single combat ready division less than 30 percent of Germany's naval ships are fully operational and many of the country's fighter aircraft are unfit to fly during exercises in Lithuania German soldiers used analog radio equipment that was not encrypted and had a shortage of ammunition and other equipment while Olaf Schultz's announced expenditures make it clear that Germany is making strides in reforming itself they have a long way to go

one and three million people died in the Vietnam War and the preceding Indochina War waged by the French the majority of which were young men leading to a tectonic shift in the gender makeup of the Vietnamese population Census Data indicates a marriage squeeze or imbalance between single men and women as late as 1989 possibly fueled by a combination of War mortality and migration regardless of its gender makeup it was the same Vietnamese population that was victimized by both sides of the war the war crimes of Vietnam demand their own video but includes the most horrendous acts against countless civilians as well as the theft of these same civilians property and destruction of their homes much of this destruction and brutality came not at the hands of crazed soldiers but simple chemistry in desperation to deprive the North Vietnamese of the Jungle that covered and concealed them the United States began using a variety of defoliants that destroyed swaths of Vietnam's native plants though exact figures are a subject of fierce debate it is estimated that roughly 10 percent of Vietnam was defoliated by agent orange and other chemicals what is not debatable is the horrors this chemical warfare wrought on Vietnam's ecosystem and people birth defects in humans and animals alike poisons in the food chain and disease directly linked to defoliant contamination continued to be found up to the time of writing civilian mistreatment did not end with the Vietnam War as many South Vietnamese citizens were sent to re-education camps by the Victorious Northerners there they were forced to perform hard labor while in the grips of starvation and disease 750 000 to 1 million Southern Vietnamese were simply shipped off to the Wilderness their homes and land confiscated and parceled out to Loyal communists but some Vietnamese managed to escape the horrors of peace with 8040 women immigrating to the United States as War Brides between 1964 and 1975. a further 26 000 children born to American servicemen and Vietnamese women were allowed to immigrate to their father's Homeland but this was a fraction of the number born many were simply abandoned when it was time to head home Colombian author and winner of the Nobel Prize for literature Gabriel Garcia Marquez did his own Grim arithmetic 360 000 people mutilated a million widows five hundred thousand prostitutes five hundred thousand drug addicts and a million tuberculosis cases and more than a million soldiers of the old regime impossible to rehabilitate into a new Society the Communist takeover of Vietnam did not lead to a cordial Block of South Asian Communist States however three years after reunification of their country Vietnam invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge the murderous dictatorship led by Pol Pot that killed an estimated quarter of its own people with a campaign of torture and starvation the Vietnamese and cambodians had long been rivals in the region and while Vietnamese and Cambodian troops had worked in concert during the American intervention the Khmer Rouge had long feared a United communist Vietnam would attempt to seize control over the entire indo-chinese region as the Vietnam War ended Cambodia conducted cross-border raids prompting Hanoi to launch an invasion in a bitter irony Vietnamese troops would find themselves in a quagmire of their own in Cambodia Carlisle Thayer of the Australian Defense Force Academy in Canberra noted the Vietnamese military had been trained and experienced in overthrowing and occupying power and all of a sudden the shoe was on the other foot they had to invade Cambodia and occupy it and succeed in setting up a government then engineer a withdrawal despite saving the country from the murderous Khmer Rouge the Vietnamese soon found themselves the targets of Cambodian frustration while still suffering from their own mental wounds a veteran of the Cambodian Invasion drew a grim parallel American soldiers thought they helped Vietnam then their illusion was broken we were the same in Cambodia but worse than being treated as an occupier by the cambodians was the reaction of the Region's most powerful player the People's Republic of China Pol Pot was an avid maoist and China had propped up his regime until the Vietnamese Invasion Chinese troops invaded Vietnam in response to their toppling of the Khmer Rouge leading to a series of Border clashes that saw 450 000 Vietnamese citizens of Chinese descent driven from their homes by their ethnic Vietnamese neighbors but perhaps the most fascinating if not ironic impact of the war was economic the economy of Vietnam was naturally left in utter ruin by the war with some stability achieved by the 1980s the Vietnamese government undertook a sweeping campaign of economic reform in 1986. dubbed DOI Moy it saw efforts to shift from their comic-con-dependent economy to a more socialist-oriented market economy eliminating communist Mainstays of price control and state monopolies fifteen percent of government jobs were cut and all centralization and collectivization of Industries and markets was undone the results have been staggering in 1990 58 of Vietnamese people lived in poverty by 2006 that number had dropped to 16 percent urbanization has well and truly taken root and Vietnam has gone from a nation requiring International Aid just to make it through the day to a burgeoning market inviting International Investment foreign Johnson escalated American involvement in the conflict he also sought to Gin up military support and build a coalition of Nations to keep Vietnam from turning red his efforts bore some fruit as Australia South Korea Thailand and New Zealand would deploy troops to the aid of the American effort in public leaders and presidents from Canada to Japan gave moral support to America's intervention while privately being skeptical of the Domino Theory guiding American foreign policy European heads of state in particular viewed Vietnam as a nationalist cause rather than some existential battle between communism and the rest of the world Charles de Gaulle president of France often and loudly ridiculed American involvement in Vietnam as a foolish Endeavor one that it should be noted his country had already tried after the indo-china war French military planners had compiled a three-volume after action report in 1955. this was valuable intelligence real narratives about the fight America was heading into paid for in blood so naturally American military leaders ignored the French reports out of hand the Pentagon was sure of American Military superiority over the French Empire besides this wasn't a war to hold on to some far-flung Asian Colony this was a fight for freedom and democracy and to keep those supposed dominoes from falling America's doggedness would prove divisive and the knock-on effects of going into Vietnam would cast a shadow over America's International relationships de Gaulle continued to give voice publicly to what other leaders thought privately until his time as president came to a close and even afterward France would Place itself front and center in the narrative around the war Paris would serve as the site of the peace talks between the U.S and North Vietnam and France advocated often and loudly in the halls of NATO for restraint and neutrality as France spoke its mind other European nations would find themselves having to give some opinion on Vietnam despite not actively participating in the conflict the United Kingdom a staunch American Ally was rather busy with Rising tensions between India and Pakistan the Malaysian Insurgency and Chinese threats to Hong Kong when Vietnam escalated leading to the UK sidelining itself in Italy the government made a board of attempts to facilitate peace talks as the war inflamed tensions between Myriad political parties neo-fascists monarchists and other conservatives were outraged at the efforts by the Christian democrats to mend fences with Italian socialists and this raging debate only intensified as the war dragged on Rome feared angering the U.S and between this anxiety and the mounting political Discord any attempt at peacemaking was abandoned in the Netherlands Firebrand anti-communist and americophile Yosef loans advocated for military action in Vietnam first as Dutch foreign secretary and later as NATO Secretary General the neutral Nation most antagonistic to the U.S during Vietnam was arguably Sweden which publicly invited Americans fleeing conscription to settle there relations between the U.S and Sweden utterly broke down in 1968 when then education Minister Olaf Palma participated in an anti-war protest alongside the North Vietnamese ambassador to the USSR leading to the U.S recalling its own ambassador to Sweden until 1970 in 1972 now prime minister Palma made a radio address following the American bombings of Hanoi likening American actions to the worst atrocities committed by the Third Reich and leading to a second breakdown in diplomacy Sweden's opposition to the war including sending medical supplies and doctors to train and treat North Vietnamese Personnel was framed as a protest of the United States ignoring the will of the Vietnamese people [Applause] the U.S remained active in world affairs after Vietnam with VIP visits to European allies made to show continued faith in America's foreign ties but as the U.S licked its wounds and learned its lessons an idea began to form that would be cited in future crises and interventions Vietnam syndrome allegedly coined by Nixon Vietnam syndrome is the idea that the defeat in Vietnam so wounded the American psyche that it induced a sense of pacifism that reverberates into the present day a wound that was self-inflicted Alexander Hague Secretary of State to Ronald Reagan opined that America could have won Vietnam if it had only applied to the full range of American power to bring about a successful outcome with Reagan himself stating that the American Military was denied permission to win the Democratic party to whom President Kennedy and Johnson belonged was written by the Vietnam war with both Pro and anti-war sentiment motivating people to disassociate those against the war left on principle while other Democrats who supported Vietnam left in frustration at the perceived domination of the Party by anti-war elements both camps would either register with the Rival Republican party or become independent voters one of the most unpopular aspects of America's involvement was the draft America's version of conscription for most of America's history outside the world wars there were sufficient volunteers that the draft was not a serious consideration but as the popularity of Vietnam and volunteer numbers both plummeted draft calls Rose the failure of Vietnam's soured Americans on the draft and President Nixon allowed the law authorizing conscription to expire in 1973. the United States has had an all-volunteer Force since and Americans continue to resent the idea of conscription although American men are legally required to register for the draft reintroducing it remains an unpopular idea with the most recent push in the early days of the war on terror failing despite the emotionally charged atmosphere of the time but the impacts of Vietnam were economic as much as they were political President Johnson refused to Levy new taxes to pay for the war sparking a cycle of inflation that damaged the American economy demand for resources increased as military spending rose with 1965 seeing the use of manufacturing infrastructure reach a level unseen since the second world war these demands coincided with Johnson's war on poverty initiatives and a tax cut intended to incentivize economic activity both factors that accelerated inflation in the American economy all told the Vietnam War cost the United States roughly 977 billion in 2022 saddling the nation with interest payments and debt servicing for decades to come the United States unequivocally failed to prevent communism from taking over Vietnam but in the post-cold war world spurts of capitalist investment have seen the country shift into a mixed economy Vietnam and the United States normalized diplomatic relations in 1995. and the former opponents are now much closer the People's Republic of China continues to apply pressure to Vietnam as part of its attempts to expand its influence despite a mixed reputation throughout the rest of Southeast Asia today Vietnam finds itself needing to balance its relationships with China and the United States as it wishes to pursue cooperation with both Powers the Vietnam of today is a nation of

of around 3 million before dropping to less than 800 000 by the end of its Siege in addition to its thriving industrial sector and strategically important position the city was titled the Cradle of bolshevism but these factors made Leningrad a high priority Target for the Nazi invasion with directive 21 designating the city as one of barbarosa's primary objectives alongside Kiev and Moscow in

two months of the war in the East beginning field Marshal Ritter von lieb's Army Group North had stormed across hundreds of miles of Soviet territory and arrived at leningrad's doorstep with almost no time to prepare the trapped citizens could only watch in horror and despair as the seemingly Unstoppable Nazi Juggernaut slammed against the gates of their beloved City the Red Army had been caught right in the middle of extensive reforms by the June Invasion and hundreds of thousands of Soviet soldiers had already been encircled and surrendered Leningrad itself was hugely undermanned and under supplied with shortages of everything from food to ammunition yet rather than flee the city on mass the star war inhabitants of Leningrad chose instead to resist the invasion with all their might in the few scant weeks prior to Army group North's arrival over a million civilian workers had helped dig multiple concentric lines of trenches around the city and fortified them with everything from reinforced concrete bunkers to improvised Timber barricades while the citizens of Leningrad struggled to prepare for the inevitable the German Advance continued practically uncontested by the demoralized forces of the Red Army by September 8th all Railway connections to Leningrad had been severed and the city was only accessible via a single Waterway connected to Lake Largo that same day German bombers struck leningrad's Warehouse District igniting a firestorm that destroyed most of these cities food Reserves yet remarkably The Defenders chose to persevere and the first German ground troops to assault the Leningrad suburbs found themselves repelled by unexpectedly heavy resistance ironically this was as much Hitler's doing as anybody else's as he had specifically ordered the commander of army Group North to refuse any and all offers of surrender from the besieged city to the fearer Leningrad represented everything he hated about the islavic race and he intended to erase it from history as thoroughly as Rome erased Carthage or the Mongols had erased the koresian Empire every man woman and child still inside Leningrad knew they were Marked for Death and this knowledge inspired them to resist there would be exterminators with every weapon at their disposal but sheer determination could only carry the Defenders so far and although the city held out against the initial German Onslaught The Siege lines proved unbreakable throughout the winter of 1941. as temperatures fell to an estimated minus 40 degrees celsius Lake ladaka froze solid enabling the construction of the road of Life across the resulting ice sheet but while many vital supplies were delivered to the besieged inhabitants of Leningrad conditions within the city rapidly worsened to such an extent that the entire wing of the police department was established explicitly to punish acts of cannibalism committed by the starving populace the police force in general was horribly overworked as over 8 000 members of the normally 13 000 strong Leningrad constabulary had been conscripted and sent to the front lines prior to the siege those who remained now had to pull double duty acting both as militia to fight off the Invaders and officers of the law in a city where murders could be committed over a slice of bread or a scrap of cloth but even when spring of 1942 brought relief from the Arctic temperatures New hardships appeared in the form of a trio of massive Siege batteries which the Germans used to turn large sections of the city into smoldering Rubble unsurprisingly the Red Army was not simply content to allow a treasured symbol of the Soviet regime to be slowly ground into the Dust by German guns and so launched many enthusiastic But ultimately futile counter-offensives against the besiegers among these was the disastrous Battle of yubon which saw the three hundred thousand strong second Soviet shock Army exhaust itself in a months-long battle of attrition against the dug in forces of army Group North before being utterly annihilated by a German counter-attack the Soviets also launched a series of failed counter-offensives from the scenevana heights east of Leningrad but in August of 1942 Rising Star Lieutenant General yeonid govarov arrived to command the Leningrad front and quickly began preparing a third much larger offensive from this Eastern redoubt by sheer coincidence gavarov's preparations coincided with army group North's own operation nordlist or Northern Light a full-scale assault on the trench lines around Leningrad this meant that when the Red Army began a coordinated attack on German positions near the scene Ivana and Maga Salient large portions of the force planned for operation nordlist had to be hastily diverted away from their intended targets to meet them the result was a bitter stalemate that persisted for three weeks with Soviet casualties exceeding over a hundred thousand men in exchange for a mere 26 000 German casualties but gavarov's efforts were successful in forcing the Nazis to cancel operation nordlished leaving army Group North in a greatly weakened position overall following the theoric victory of his cinevana offensive General gavarov spent the rest of 1942 carefully preparing for yet another assault on the German Lines by now the war in the East was starting to turn against the axis forces but Hitler remained fully committed to his genocidal agenda against the Slavic peoples day and night Leningrad was methodically hammered with artillery fire and luftwaffe bomber formations intent on smashing the city to Rubble block by block attacks on the road of Life were constant with bombs capable of shattering the thick ice often sending whole Supply convoys to a watery grave but still the starving citizens resisted working in unheated unroofed workshops to reload spent shell casings and repair damaged equipment astonishingly enough street cars and bus stations operated even during the worst months of The Siege while schools continue to offer in classes to children not engaged in combat related activities such as fire watching zotaxed to their very limits hospitals and Medical Services worked around the clock to prevent disease successfully containing potentially devastating outbreaks of Cholera typhus and typhoid fever these efforts were all the more impressive considering that the average worker was surviving on less than 300 calories per day the equivalent of three slices of bread fortunately for the embattled citizens of Leningrad January of 1943 saw General govarov leap Into The Fray with operation iskra an offensive designed to break German lines south of Lake Largo and Link the Leningrad front up with the nearby volkov front the gap between the two fronts was a mere 16 kilometers or 10 miles however every Soviet advance in the area would be made under constant artillery bombardment from the guns normally occupied with shelling Leningrad additionally the terrain around Lake lotuga consisted of heavily forested Wetlands severely limiting the deployment of mechanized units the only real Advantage these Soviets had was that German forces faced a severe Manpower shortage and lacked the Strategic reserves necessary to launch the kind of aggressive counter-attacks and encirclements that had caused such appalling losses during earlier campaigns after several days operation iskra commenced on January the 12th thanks to heavy air support provided by over 800 Soviet planes troops were able to quickly Advance into the gap on both sides but within 24 hours weather conditions took a turn for the worse grounding the Air Force and leaving the Red Army stalled until the 14th the next four days consisted of an incredibly grueling slog through miles of German trench lines with Soviet forces from the Leningrad front finally linking up with their volkov counterparts in the early hours of the 18th this marked the first time a land connection had been made between the Defenders of Leningrad and the rest of the Soviet Union in over a year and Battlefield Engineers raced to complete and improvised rail line to the city unfortunately iskra's overall success was limited as the bulk of army Group North remained firmly entrenched around Leningrad and although supplies could now be reliably shipped into the besieged city The Siege itself was still far from over this was proven just a few weeks later when the Soviets attempted the much larger operation Polar Star intended to encircle large sections of army Group North and drive them out of the Leningrad region for good as 1943 dragged on the situation in the East shifted progressively in favor of the Soviet Union but despite operation iskra eliminating the possibility of Leningrad falling Army Group North stubbornly maintained The Siege throughout the entire year by this point leningrad's population had dropped to as low as 750 000 with tens of thousands having been evacuated after the success of operation escrow the city itself was also remarkably intact thanks to German troops having never penetrated beyond the outer suburbs though enduring unfathomable hardship leningrad's industrial sector had never shut down completely and citizens continued showing up for work even during the harsh winter months thanks to their perseverance the worst of the siege was over but they rode to victory was still long and bloody however Polar Star was doomed from the start as the Germans preemptively evacuated many of the key areas being targeted for encirclement shortening their defensive lines and leaving the exhausted red army forces with no choice but to Halt their advance until the spring thaw with winter once again on the horizon General gavarov now sought to replicate the success of his earlier offensives with another January campaign after consultation with high command gavarov formulated a battle plan that called for his second shock Army to encircle German forces in Peter Goff and strellna regions while other elements of both fronts flanked the German 18th Army in simultaneous attacks Southwest of Leningrad and in the navgarad region after destroying the 18th Army the two fronts would Advance toward narva and piskov driving the Germans ahead of them and out of the region while this was ongoing German reinforcements would be kept out of The Fray by diversionary attacks on Army group North's right flank from the second Baltic front ensuring The Liberation of Leningrad once and for all after intense preparation the Leningrad navgrav offensive began on the night of January the 13th 1944 when a swarm of Soviet night bombers struck targets all across the region this was followed by an hour-long artillery barrage on the regional airfields being used by the luftwaffe suppressing them long enough for infantry and mechanized forces to punch through Army group North's outer defenses in less than 24 hours the Soviets had Advanced along a 10 kilometer or 6.21 mile front creating a Salient 3 kilometers or 1.8 miles deep into enemy territory to the south and east of Leningrad the 42nd and 67th Soviet armies maintained pressure on German positions during the night allowing the main advance to push a further four kilometers or two and a half miles the 15th of January saw rifle Corps from the 42nd and second shock Army racing a further six kilometers or 3.7 miles blasting their way through heavy counter-attacks from the third SS Panzer Corps in the process further to the east other elements of the 42nd Army were busy giving German positions a taste of daily life in Leningrad by bombarding them with over 220 000 artillery shells in just a few hours this was followed up by a strong assault against the shell-shocked Defenders at the town of polkava opening another deep Salient into the enemy line however these advances were exceptionally costly with hundreds of Soviet losses for every bunker ditch or trench line pried loose from the German Death grip in fact initial casualty reports were so lopsided that an unwarranted sense of optimism began to take hold among the German officer Corps with General major Gerhard Lindemann of the 18th Army predicting that he could defeat the supposedly overextended Soviet Force within three days 72 hours later on the 20th Lindemann was frantically begging his superiors for non-existent reserves as gavarov's forces ripped through the entrenched Nazi lines that had maintained the siege of Leningrad for over 870 consecutive days with no possibility of recovering from these devastating losses Army Group North went into a full Retreat and within a week the front lines had been pushed back over 100 miles from the city in many ways The Siege ended just as abruptly as it had begun with the lightning pace of the Soviet Advance mirroring that of army Group North during Operation Barbarossa on the 26th of January Joseph Stalin personally declared the liberation of Leningrad to both the Soviet Union and the rest of the world great celebrations broke out all across the city at the news but even the most enthusiastic citizens could not ignore the devastation surrounding them though Leningrad had suffered less damage overall than cities like Berlin or Warsaw eventually would as soon as their position had become untenable the Nazis had done their best to obliterate all traces of Russian culture within the region special effort had been made to raid leningrad's many museums and art galleries with thousands of Irreplaceable paintings statues and historical exhibits looted or burned by the Invaders destroyed landmarks included the old palaces of the Russian czars which had previously managed to stay intact even through the Soviet Revolution in terms of human lives lost the siege of Leningrad caused at least 640 000 civilian casualties many of whom were women and children who died of starvation or frostbite during the Arctic winter of 1941. yet this number was utterly dwarfed by the deaths sustained by the Red Army during both the defense of the city and the many operations undertaken to liberate it conservative estimates Place Soviet casualties against Army Group North at around 3 million while German losses amounted to around 500 000. Hitler's obsession with destroying the so-called cradle of bolshevism is widely regarded as one of his key tactical mistakes during Barbarossa wasting vast amounts of Manpower and resources on a Target whose symbolic importance far outweighed its strategic value foreign [Music]\",\n",

lightning speed as its armies closed in on Berlin its men vowed to take revenge for the death and destruction the Germans had brought upon the motherland Hitler however would not go down without a fight and forced his defeated people into one more cataclysmic bloodletting that would not end until the hammer and sickle finally flew above the reichstag and the fuhrer lay dead in his underground

annihilation of army group Center the seemingly Unstoppable Red Army had chased the Vermont to the gates of Warsaw in the South Romania and Bulgaria had capitulated and changed sides while Hungary verged on collapse as Soviet armies laid Siege to Budapest unwilling to admit defeat Hitler now made the momentous decision to deploy his final armored reserves to relieve the city's Defenders and secure hungary's oil fields this as it turned out was exactly what the Soviet High command better known as the istofka had hoped for by increasing pressure on the Hungarian front Stalin and his advisors aimed to lure the fuhrer into moving his vital armored reserves away from Poland while three Soviet fronts totaling some 2.5 million men would make a dash across the vestula river around Warsaw and drive straight toward Berlin to mentally prepare their men for the coming struggle political commissars handed out instructions that echoed the overwhelming sentiment felt among the embittered Soviet Soldiers the soldiers rage in battle must be terrible he does not merely seek to fight he must also be the embodiment of the court of his people's Justice fueled by a desire for Revenge Stalin's armies began breaking out of their bridgeheads on January 12th within days The outgunned Defenders were forced into a frenzied Retreat on the 15th General Heinz guderian pleaded with Hitler to send every available unit East the fuhrer in turn made great promises in the form of two SS panzerkor recently withdrawn from the ardenne however rather than arriving to salvage the situation in Poland they were thrown into yet another one of Hitler's armored pipe dreams in Hungary lacking sufficient mobile reserves the bulk of the ill-fated German Defenders were encircled and destroyed as the catastrophe unfolded the Berlin radio broadcasted apocalyptic news bulletins which compared the advancing Red Army to the Mongol hordes the Huns and the tartars who were out to bring total Destruction and the end of civilization driven by fear a growing mass of German refugees began a long deadly march across the icy roads leading westward in hopes of eluding the jaws of Soviet Vengeance the dreaded red horde however was moving at lightning speed and by the end of January its armies had Advanced some 500 kilometers or nearly 311 miles to the banks of the odor River just 60 kilometers or 37 miles from Berlin however the rapid Advance had stretched the red Army's Logistics to their limit and heavy resistance in East Prussia had left Marshall Georgie zhukov's flank dangerously exposed to counter-attack from German troops massing in Pomerania as a result the estofka decided to Halt the final assault on Berlin until the flanks were secured by mid-april the Red Army had reached the odor Niza River Line on a front that stretched from steten in the North to the Czech Border in the south the eyes of the world were now converging on Berlin as Stalin's armies prepared for their final Act of Vengeance that would eradicate Nazi Germany once and for all although the Allies had promised to leave Berlin to the Red Army the ever paranoid Stalin still urged haste in the capture of the city the final Plan called for a three-pronged attack on the Berlin axis to encircle and capture the city within 12 to 15 days then move on to meet the Allies at the Elbow River zhukov's first Bella Russian front would be at the center of the thrust while Marshall Ivan koneff's first Ukrainian front to the South was set to attack across the naiza river in the direction of Potsdam and Dresden finally Marshall Constantine rokusovsky's second belarussian front would tie down German forces to the north in the stetenshvet sector to prevent them from reinforcing Berlin having become accustomed to fighting on wide open terrain few in the Red Army had much experience in large-scale urban street fighting it was up to General vasili troykov's eighth guards army veterans of the Battle of Stalingrad to distribute pamphlets on Urban Warfare while special combined arms task forces were formed Red Army Engineers on their part worked day and night to construct hundreds of bridges and thousands of wooden assault boats to cross the odor and naiza rivers to achieve this Soviet planners had to find a way to move 29 armies over hundreds of kilometers to create shock groups capable of penetrating the German line in areas only 2.5 to 10 kilometers or 1.5 to 6 miles in width when it was all said and done the Red Army would Advance on Berlin with some 2.5 million men 6 250 tanks and self-propelled guns and 7500 combat aircraft aiming to make the Invaders bleed for every inch of German soil the vermacht constructed a series of well-entrenched defensive lines which barricaded the way into Berlin Manning these positions were the remains of army group fistula and fourth Panzer Army as well as the Berlin Garrison combined this Force consisted of 750 000 German soldiers supported by 1519 tanks and assault guns 9 303 guns and mortars and 2 200 aircraft however these numbers looked more impressive on paper than they did in reality as virtually all of its formations were under strength although many units were led by battle-hardened Veterans of the Eastern Front their Rank and file was often made up of a mix of wounded unfit and inexperienced soldiers and even boys from the Hitler Youth moreover some 60 000 of the Defenders came from under-trained and barely armed volkster militia battalions the Infantry would not be able to count much on its armored and air assets either as the Germans lacked the fuel reserves to keep its otherwise considerable force of fighting Vehicles operational for any extended period of time morale was also at an all-time low most suffered from malnutrition and a lack of hygiene and saved for the most fanatical Nazis few now believed in the promise of final victory even so every effort was made to convince the men that the much anticipated wunderwaffen would still turn the tide of the war and that peace talks with the Western allies were soon to bear fruit but if these motivations were only marginally effective the widespread fear of Soviet Vengeance and barbarism drove even the most cynical to continue fighting on April 12th the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra gave its last performance among the music played was Richard Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries four days later another type of Orchestra began to play as thousands of katyusha rocket launchers and field guns of zhukov's front opened up on the first German defensive line along these Halo Heights miles away in Berlin's Eastern suburbs houses began to shake as terrified citizens gathered in the street to listen to the start of the coming storm a stunned Russian engineer described to the unfolding spectacle along the whole lengths of the Horizon it was bright as daylight on the German side everything was covered with smoke and thick foundations of Earth and clumps flying up there were huge flocks of scared birds flying around in the sky a constant humming Thunder explosions we had to cover our ears to prevent our eardrums breaking as the sound of artillery gradually faded hundreds of men began shouting to Berlin as tank engines roared and the elite assault elements began advancing toward the heights many of the German Defenders unfortunate enough to have been caught in the preceding Onslaught had disappeared in the blink of an eye while dazed and panic-stricken survivors rushed back toward the second defensive line however the awesome bombardment obscured serious problems in zhukov's plan the destruction caused by the shelling had been so great in scope that it had severely worsened the condition of the terrain that his men now had to Traverse these searchlights intended to Blind the enemy instead reflected onto the smoke-filled air and obscured the vision of the advancing infantry in the resulting chaos units lost contact with each other as Soviet artillery and aircraft began attacking friendly formations worse still German intelligence had had prior knowledge of the coming offensive which meant that many of the first-line troops had been evacuated to the safety of the rear what ensued was nothing less than what a member of the gross Deutschland guard regiment described as a slaughterhouse countless soldiers were cut down as they struggled to advance across the flood Plains and through German minefields in other sectors too the attackers were cut down and repulsed as they attempted to cross the odor sensing disaster and increasingly agitated zhukov ordered his two tank armies to attack at once however most of the infantry's artillery and Supply Vehicles were still trying to make their way to the front causing the tank armies to become hopelessly stuck in an endless traffic jam even when the lead armor finally approached the heights they found themselves ambushed by concealed 88 gun emplacements Tiger 1 tanks and infantry armed with deadly Panzer fouls to recoilless anti-tank launchers foreign ly zhukov's decimated men had made little progress at the end of the first day and it would take three more days and countless more dead before his armies finally forced their way through the final defensive line naturally Stalin was infuriated but he could rest easy in the fact that conebs front to the South had seen more success by the end of April the 18th his tank armies were across the spray River and were racing toward Berlin lacking sufficient reinforcements and ammunition the surviving defenders in both sectors were forced into a headlong retreat with the German defensive lines in the South and in the center broken and with vital troops in the north still tied down in heavy fighting the road to Berlin lay open lacking the supplies to keep on fighting German morale now visibly began to collapse thousands of encircled men surrendered while masses of stragglers deserter and refugees made their way into the doomed City all the while an increasingly delusional Hitler continued to demand fanatical resistance until The Bitter End on April 20th the fuhrer's birthday was rudely interrupted by Soviet artillery shelling Berlin's Northeastern suburbs as its citizens fled into Sellers zhukov and konaf's tank armies began a frantic race to these City's outskirts in the meantime many senior officials of the Nazi party engaged in a similar type of competition to be the first one to get permission to flee the city soldiers on the ground enjoyed no such Privileges and those who tried to run or displayed signs of cowardice were summarily hanged throughout the city with messages such as I was a coward or I was a deserter dangling from their chests the next morning Soviet artillery fired a frenzied barrage into Berlin's City Center while the remains of General Helmut vaidling's 56th Panzer Corps of the German ninth Army conducted a desperate withdrawal across Berlin's Autobahn ring while being mercilessly strafed by Soviet aircraft other remnants of the German defense attempted in vain to stop zhukov's armies from pushing into the city from the southwestern and Northern flanks however its depleted units could only delay the enemy and zhukov and konaf's forces both reached the city's outskirts that evening believing himself to be the next Frederick the great Hitler remained confident that a massive counter-stroke by the newly created Army Detachment Steiner and Ninth Army against zhukov's flanks would trap the Invaders In The City in a ploy similar to what had befallen the Germans at Stalingrad two years prior when it became clear on the following day that Schneider's Army Detachment lacked sufficient strength and ammunition to attack the fearer finally cracked and openly admitted for the first time that all was hopelessly lost with the Soviets breaking into the city General weidling was appointed commander of the Berlin defense area however by the time weidling took command only about 45 000 Vermont and SS troops just over 40 000 men of the volkstorm and a measly 60 fuel starved tanks were left standing to defend the city against some 1.5 million Soviet troops unsurprisingly zhukov's armies had managed to push the Defenders out of the eastern and Southeastern suburbs by the end of the 23rd while other fronts tightened their grasp around these City's flanks with Inevitable Defeat looming on the horizon many of the Defenders began to lay down their arms others however continued to resist fanatically at the templehof airport a mixed group of ss-led German Defenders including some 100 Hitler Youth wreaked havoc on the attacking Soviet tanks and infantry who had to resort to massive aerial and artillery bombardment to finally capture the airport a day later by that time the encirclement of Berlin had been completed however a manic Hitler promised weidling that yet another massive counter-offensive by General venk's 12th Army in the southwest was sure to come to the rescue of the beleaguered Defenders venk however had no intention on embarking in a futile suicide mission and instead moved to relieve encircled German troops further to the east with no further hope of relief weidling urged the fearer to Stage a breakout Westward to join up with remnants of army group fistula Hitler however rejected the plan and restated his intention to fall at the head of his troops during the next three days the Red Army tightened its hold on Berlin as the advancing armies closed in on the inner defensive line protecting the governmental District the lack of clear demarcation lines between the fronts however led to various formations competing for space and getting hopelessly confused in the ensuing Quagmire after careful deliberation it was decided that most of konaf's frustrated men were to be redeployed to Czechoslovakia while zhukov was to go in for the final kill by the end of the 29th the eighth guards Army had blasted its way through the heavily defended tiergarten sector while the third shock Army had crossed the spray over the maltika bridge just to the north in front of them lay the Ultimate Prize the blackened walls of the reichstag the former Parliamentary Building widely regarded as the symbolic heart of the Third Reich capturing it would be nothing less than the culmination of the entire Soviet war effort the defense of the building and its surroundings was led by a determined group of mostly foreign SS Fighters with little less to lose in the morning of the following day Soviet artillery opened fire as a few hundred assault troops rushed forward after a heavy fire fight the men reached the main entrance and proceeded to clear the building in brutal Close Quarters combat after hours of bitter fighting the red banner was spotted hanging from the second floor at around 2 30 PM but it wouldn't be until late in the evening before a path to the roof had finally been cleared two sergeants identified as mikayo yagorov and melaton kantaria managed to reach the top and hoisted the hammer and sickle on top of the reichstag marking the symbolic end of Hitler's Third Reich as this historic moment unfolded an even more momentous event occurred barely a kilometer away with Soviet troops converging on his bunker complex the embittered fuhrer knew that he had reached the end of the line the German people had failed him and his vision of a Thousand-Year Reich after giving weidling the go-ahead to attempt a belated breakout the fury set his farewells to his remaining staff poisoned his dog Blondie and retired to his study room to commit suicide together with his newly wedded bride Ava Brown but Hitler's death did not put an immediate end to the fighting the new Chancellor Joseph Goebbels rejected Stalin's demand for an unconditional surrender of the Garrison prompting the Red Army to blast the remaining German positions until the defense was reduced to little more than a few isolated pockets with gerbil's subsequent suicide being announced that night the door to peace in Berlin could finally be opened at 6am on May 2nd General weidling officially ordered his remaining men to lay down their arms when the guns finally fell silent in the afternoon an eerie silence descended on the city of which troykov would later write the flame of world war was quenched there once it arose although fighting in Europe would continue until Germany's unconditional surrender on May 8th the war had come to a climax at the Battle of Berlin the capture of Germany's capital had cost the Red Army an estimated 78 000 men killed in action and over 274 000 wounded in return the Germans had lost some 90 to 100 000 men killed in action as well as at least another 200 000 wounded during their Advance into Germany the vengeful Red Army had left a trail of pillage and destruction in its wake an estimated 95 000 to 130 000 women in Berlin alone are said to have been sexually assaulted of which ten thousand would later commit suicide still many Germans were relieved that the conflict was finally over and that a semblance of normal human life was slowly returning under shared Allied Soviet occupation however the alliance between the two Victors would prove short-lived and the star of the Cold War would Usher a new type of crisis in the city which had suffered so much during the second World War foreign\",\n",

Company of Heroes 3 using our Link in the description below by Spring of 1943 Benito Mussolini's mishandling of the war had turned the majority of his political party against him though holding near total Authority as prime minister Mussolini was technically subordinate to the reigning king of Italy Victor Emmanuel III who could remove him from office at any time but Victor Emmanuel was a notoriously cautious Monarch and had deliberately fostered the fascist regime in Italy to preserve his own authority it was not until shortly after the fall of Sicily that opposition forces dared to approach the king and it took multiple assurances from president of the Chamber of fasces and corporations count Dino Grande before he agreed to back Marshall Pietro badoglio as the next prime minister of Italy Emmanuel was desperate to cling to power and viewed badoglio as an easily manipulated underling who could be relied on to help him reassert his authority over Italy and to negotiate a favorable ceasefire with the allies but even with Victor Emmanuel's backing Grande knew that a dangerous struggle lay ahead as several other members of the grand Council were still Ardent fascists who remained committed to the war effort on July the 24th the members of the grand Council of fascism met in the Palazzo Venezia to decide the fate of their Nation outside smoke still Rose from ruined factories and Basilica of Saint Lawrence devastated by Allied bombing raids just five days prior the mood was exceptionally tense with Dino Grande going so far as to conceal a pair of hand grenades under his jacket in case violence broke out though armed black shirts surrounded the building Benito Mussolini entered without his personal bodyguard and immediately launched into a furious defense of his own actions Grande replied with a speech that besieged the king to resume control over the nation and concluded with a vicious jab at the duche himself let perish all factions so that the nation can live arguments raged back and forth throughout the evening as the various fascist members of the council Rose to argue their points with the supporters of the King after nine hours the council was split over several ordina delgiorno or orders of the day each outlining a radically different course for the nation to break up this confused tangle of conflicting interests grandi demanded the unthinkable an actual vote the first to take place in the entire 15-year history of the council to his immeasurable relief Grandy's order of the day carried a majority and a broken Mussolini was forced to deliver it to the king in person the next day Victor Emmanuel then ordered his arrest and informed badoglio that he was the new prime minister within hours huge crowds were swarming through the streets of all major Italian cities defacing statues chipping off murals and making bonfires out of former fascist regalia the grand Council would disband itself shortly thereafter bringing Italy's 21 year old fascist regime to a stunningly abrupt and ignominious end unfortunately this extraordinary political upheaval left many unanswered questions most prominent of which was what exactly to do about the eight German divisions that began advancing into Northern Italy on the day of Mussolini's arrest King Victor Emmanuel was still backing a highly authoritarian government ruling under martial law and his plea is for assurances of Allied support for the monarchy delayed the opening negotiations to take Italy out of the war for 45 days the government struggled to assemble a coherent agenda while the king relapsed into passivity in the end badoglio arranged secret talks with the Allies signing the Armistice of casabele which assigned Italy the role of co-belligerent against Germany but the Allies refused to alter their existing timetable for the invasion of Italy and badoglio was unable to arrange a defense of the nation before being forced to publicly announce the armistice in response case access was devised as an operation to disarm the Italian military and set up a puppet regime in Northern Italy on September 9th with German troops racing toward the capital bodolio Victor Emmanuel and most of their government fled South into the waiting arms of the Allies the subsequent power vacuum in Rome allowed numerous opposition parties to emerge from hiding including the Christian democrats the Socialists and the Communists who quickly founded the committee of National Liberation or cln September 9th was also the starting date for operation Avalanche a massive amphibious landing at Salerno by the U.S Fifth Army their goal was the capture of Naples which had already been heavily damaged by Allied bombing campaigns social order had almost entirely broken down thanks to the widespread arrest and Detention of the carabineri or Italian police forces who had been deemed a monarchist threat by the German occupation on the 12th Colonel Walter Scholl took command of Naples and declared that up to 100 citizens would be executed for every German life lost Shoal then ordered 240 neapolitans living near the coastline to evacuate making it clear he planned to demolish the entire Port District to deny it to the attackers this was accompanied by a declaration that all Italian males aged between 18 and 30 would be conscripted for forced labor and a day later Shoal dispatched troops to round up as many men as possible this caused huge crowds of mostly unarmed neapolitans to burst out onto the streets their ranks augmented by a few soldiers who had managed to escape detention The Following chaos would be known as the four days of Naples with uncoordinated but highly motivated groups of partisans striking at the occupiers in any way they could on the third day the partisans gained the upper hand after corralling Colonel Scholl inside the City Stadium where he was forced to negotiate for the release of Italian prisoners housed there a day later the German Garrison began to pull out of the city leaving the partisans battered but Victorious and the vital Port facilities intact for Allied usage while the people of Naples made their stand major events had been taking place further north after his arrest Mussolini had been detained in the heavily guarded Grand Sasso Mountain Complex the question of what to do with the former duche was solved for the Allies on September 12th when German special operative Otto scorzani rescued Mussolini from captivity and spirited him North to become the prime minister of the new Italian social Republic also known as the Republic of celo or RSI but Mussolini's failures had hardly left him in good standing with Adolf Hitler and his new fascist regime was all but completely subordinate to its Nazi counterpart with Germany seizing the Italian gold reserve and allowing the RSI only a token military force Mussolini however was allowed to recreate his personal militia who would quickly come to be known as the brigate Neri or black brigades formed expressly to suppress partisan activity the black brigades would operate closely with the German military and assist in many massacres of Italian civilians but news of these war crimes would strengthen the resolve of the Italian citizenry to resist the RSI and Mussolini's first conscription campaigns drove thousands of middle-class Italians to flee into the mountains and take up arms against the fascist puppet government these initial Guerrilla bands were primarily composed of Communists augmented by deserters or Italian soldiers who had managed to keep hold of their weapons some were also outright Bandits who terrorized the local peasantry for personal enrichment the situation was made worse by constant Allied bombing campaigns focused primarily on the three industrial cities of Turin Milan and Genoa in March of 1944 several hundred thousand Italian workers in Milan went on strike pleading with the RSI to stop making their Nation a Target by supplying weapons to Germany of course Mussolini rejected these demands and the protest was suppressed with thousands sent to German labor camps this was the last straw for many Italians and thousands began flocking to the banner of the cln in an effort to reassert dominance the Germans would retaliate by slaughtering 335 Italians in the rdatine massacre a few months later German soldiers and black Brigade members surrounded the village of Saint Anna di stotzema none of the villagers had been directly implicated in a partisan attack but the Germans executed 560 of them anyway in an effort to terrorize the rest of the populace into submission but far from cowing the partisans the brutality of the RSI and its allies only encouraged more over resistance as between the end of 1943 and summer of 1944 partisan membership exploded from fewer than 9000 to well over thirty thousand due to the distance separating the partisans in the RSI from their counterparts further south the cln would establish a new branch in February creatively named the National Liberation committee for Northern Italy or clnai thanks to increasing Allied support the clnai began to campaign throughout the mountainous regions of Northern Italy using the rough terrain to strike and then melt back into cover these tactics were remarkably successful leading Albert kesselring to estimate that in the summer alone partisan activity accounted for over 20 000 German and RSI casualties unfortunately this daring campaign would come to an abrupt halt at the start of the winter when British general Harold Alexander declared the Allied Advance would not continue until spring with intense cold driving the partisans down from the mountains the RSI was able to make a significant comeback the clnai was also in a difficult position due to the Minor Detail that 70 of its members were outspoken Communists which made the Western allies distinctly wary of closer cooperation this led to the signing of the Rome protocols where the two halves of the cln agreed to voluntarily disarm as soon as the Liberation was complete in exchange for the Allies guaranteeing their support while hostilities were ongoing the spring of 1945 marked the beginning of the end for the axis in Italy and an escalation of violence between the two sides of the Civil War that exceeded anything seen previously in April the Allies began their final assault on the gothic line accompanied by a message from the Italian Communist party to the clnai telling them it was time to launch a final Insurrection against the RSI leveraging their ties to the disaffected workers in Turin Elan and Genoa the Communists went above and beyond expectations launching a general Uprising against the RSI that plunged the whole po valley region into Anarchy Mussolini reacted to these events by going into a State of Shock desperately ordering his token military force and black brigades to suppress the Rebellion while dithering between negotiating for his own life and making a glorious Last Stand of some sort on the 25th he left Milan along with his personal guard and made a dash for the voltelina redout at the base of the Alps though he joined up with a retreating column of German soldiers Mussolini's fate was sealed when partisans attacked and surrounded them having no wish to die alongside the dictator the Germans negotiated for their freedom in exchange for abandoning Mussolini his mistress and various other Italian fascists to their fate Mussolini would be executed within 24 hours and his body put on display for public mockery it is a testimony to just how completely insignificant Mussolini was at this point that his death was ultimately little more than a footnote in history of the Italian civil war with the Germans scrambling to flee Italy the cln AI swept up the remnants of the RSI with little effort with over 250 000 partisans facing less than a tenth of their number in black shirts and fascist loyalists but the clnai was not about to rest on its laurels and instead raced to establish improvised courts and execute as many members of the old regime as possible before the government in Exile could return this was a dangerous time for Italy as some of the hard-line Communists saw this as a chance to carry Italy into a full socialist Revolution however cooler heads in the movement New Britain and America would never tolerate the emergence of a communist nation in the heart of Europe and even Joseph Stalin condemned the idea thus the Italian Communist party instead slaked its thirst for fascist blood with its show trials and summery executions before politely cleaning itself up and taking AC at the table of the new Italian democratic system perhaps seeing the writing on the wall the exiled Victor Emmanuel III chose to abdicate in May of 1946 and passed the throne on to his son Umberto II but with the nation still racked by civil unrest Umberto decided his best option was to Stage a referendum on the continuation of the monarchy surprisingly enough the Republican side squeaked past with just 54 of the vote but this would have little impact on the momentum of the cln in post-war Circles of power this was followed by the toliati amnesty for both Communists and fascists alike on the 22nd of June 1946 drawing a line under the bloody reparations conducted during the last days of the Civil War for his extraordinary bravery and standing up to Mussolini and his fascist allies in the Palazzo Venezia Dino Grande would spend most of the rest of his life in quiet Exile before returning to Italy shortly before his death foreign s during the second world war played host two partisan movements and collaborationist governments Italy stands out as unique for the extent to which brother fought against brother though both the Allied and axis forces did their best to prevent Italian soldiers from the RSI and co-belligerent armies from clashing no such effort was made to keep the fascist black brigades and partisans away from each other's throats even today the Italian socialist movements Define themselves by the experiences shared during the Civil War and still maintain a prominent place in Italian political circles meanwhile Mussolini's grave is the site of fascist Gatherings every year with a small yet still significant number of Italians still holding sympathy for a man they view as having lifted Italy out of the Great Depression and into the modern era yet Perhaps the greatest lesson of the Italian Civil War is that even a nation forced to undergo massive economic and social upheaval can hold together and rebuild [Music]\",\n",

beginnings as the third and only surviving son of a naval conscript and factory worker Putin would climb the ever-shifting power structure of first the Soviet Union and then the Russian Federation until finally claiming his place as leader of one of the largest most powerful Nations but Putin's rise to prominence amongst his peers is inextricably linked with the Chechen Wars a series of conflicts fought over control of the country of chechnya in the northern Caucasus in this video we'll be examining the second Chechen war and exploring how Putin's careful political schemes exploited the unstable region to both expand the scope of Russian influence and enable his own Ascension to the highest office in the nation in a region as ethnically diverse as the caucuses being able to

description below during the chaotic First Years of the post-soviet era the small and fairly insignificant Breakaway Chechen Republic of ichiria was mostly left to its own devices while President Boris Yeltsin struggled to create a viable Russian government and stabilize the economy but Yeltsin always kept the region in the back of his mind fearing that other Russian republics would use chechnya's example to make their own bids for freedom chechnya was utterly plagued with crime and Corruption to such an extent ethnic Russians were leaving in droves and by November of 1994 Yeltsin authorized the use of disguised military personnel to overthrow the government then openly resorted to force after this attempt failed but yeltsin's hope of a brief easy intervention were dashed when the poorly coordinated Russian Advance on the capital city of grozny was stalled for Days by a Motley collection of Chechen troops volunteers and foreign mercenaries even when grozny fell the chechens simply began a protracted Guerrilla war in the countryside the Chechen president at the time was zekar dadayath a veteran of the Soviet Afghan war who knew exactly how to counter the Federation offensives while much of the field actions were organized by a military officer and hard-line Muslim extremist named Shamil basaya who had close ties with the mujahideen though guilty of blatant acts of terrorism against the Russian people visayath would go on to serve as the chairman of chechnya after Yeltsin was forced to sign the kasafiert Accords in 1996. these Accords brought hostilities to an end but left the status of chechnya in a gray area that both sides knew would only cause future conflict 1996 was also an election year in Russia and thanks to the bungled war effort the increasingly unpopular and unhealthy Boris Yeltsin urgently needed support against his political Rivals enter Vladimir Putin an unassuming former KGB agent brought on to assist yeltsin's campaign for the next seven months the powerful Moscow oligarchs Savaged each other in the political Arena while Putin discreetly toiled in the background in 1997 a successfully re-elected Yeltsin promoted him to chief of the main control directorate of the presidential property management department and Deputy Chief of the presidential staff this gave Putin wide-reaching authority to investigate government corruption which he prosecuted with a selective diligence that always conveniently benefited the Yeltsin Administration the connections he forged via these investigations would earn him many friends and equally as many enemies and were instrumental in his appointment to the directorship of the Federal Security Service in 1998 and the Office of Prime Minister in August 1999 after Yeltsin fired his previous prime minister and entire political cabinet for the fourth time but while Putin was busy amassing power with yeltsin's presidency Shamil basayath was plotting to destroy it on August 7th Messiah and fellow Muslim extremist IBN el-katab led a 1400 strong islamist Insurgency into the neighboring Republic of Dagestan intending to establish a new Chechen Dagestan Islamic Republic Putin used the conflict to divert attention away from his increasingly noisy whistleblowers and vocal critics within the Russian government having already begun emerging from yeltsin's Shadow Putin now asked the president for absolute power to coordinate the Russian response to Dagestan Yeltsin and the rest of the Russian Duma agreed and Putin threw himself into proving that the Russian Federation still had its teeth within a month the dream of an Islamic Republic had been trampled into the Dust by the boots of nearly 20 000 Russian soldiers backed up by artillery airstrikes and even a small number of shiny new t-90 main battle tanks but just as War seemed to be wrapping up early in September a series of explosions rocked apartment complexes across Moscow and Volga Dansk Putin had intelligence Assets in chechnya and these swiftly blamed Ebina L catab for the deaths of at least 293 innocent Russian civilians the explosions also outraged the nation and this Spirit of righteous indignation was expertly channeled by Putin's rhetoric at the time and his popularity skyrocketed when he began aggressively calling for Retribution against chechnya the issue was that the president of chechnya Aslan mascadov was absolutely desperate to avoid another war in August Russian planes had entered Chechen airspace and bombed retreating mujahideen but muscatif refused to retaliate while Putin prepared to attack moscatov was practically screaming his desire to negotiate from the nearest rooftop going so far as to repeatedly try to telephone Yeltsin personally only to be ignored at every turn of course absolutely none of this mattered to Putin and on the 30th of September 90 000 Russian soldiers thundered across the border into Northern chechnya now led by experienced Veterans of the first Chechen War the Russians reacted to Urban guerrilla warfare by simply flattening every piece of available cover with gratuitous amounts of artillery fire and airstrikes the local Chechen Village Elders were politely told to expel any Rebels and submit to occupation or have their settlements declared terrorist bases and subsequently bombed to Rubble by early November the Russians were advancing across the tyric river straight towards grozny to surround it and blast The Defenders into submission with overwhelming Firepower on the 12th gooder Mass the second largest city in chechnya felt to the Russian advance and just a few weeks later the first troops reached the outskirts of grozny and began the siege over the next two months grozny was subjected to constant bombardment while Russian troops secured strategic positions in the suburbs and skirmished with their Chechen counterparts who often tried disguising themselves in Russian uniforms during nighttime raids in early December the nearby city of argon fell after significant resistance that left several hundred Russians dead or wounded with its capture grozny was surrounded and the real Attack could begin the Russian plan of attack involved dividing grozny into 15 sectors reconnoited one by one to identify enemy strongholds these would then be subjected to long-range bombardment before sappers created safe corridors for infantry to secure the sector the bulk of the street fighting would be done by loyalist Chechen militia under the command of a former mayor of grozny beslan gontamirov backing up the militia were two MVD brigades and several units of the feared Russian Special Forces operatives these Spetsnaz the operation was intended to reduce the mobility of Chechen Defenders and create a spiderweb of russian-controlled areas throughout the city after this web had been woven around grozny storm detachments of 30 to 50 men would break up pockets of serious resistance while the militia would mop up the stragglers each Detachment also had access to sniper rifles rocket-propelled grenades and the Tariff terrifying schmel RPO a flamethrower on the 24th of December the first Russian soldiers Advanced into grozny escorted closely by tanks and backed up by BMP infantry fighting vehicles that also acted as field ambulances with so much Firepower at their disposal the Russians avoided close combat whenever possible instead marking clusters of resistance for elimination by mortar and artillery barrages the first reports of the battle to reach the Russian media were glowingly positive describing the occupation of huge swaths of grozny and virtually no direct confrontations With the Enemy but in reality the fighting was vicious hectic and extremely intense Guerrilla Fighters were constantly sneaking past the siege lines to reinforce their comrades in the city and were far more numerous and determined than expected the Chechen militia complained they were left unsupported during engagements and the Russian troops often failed to adequately secure sectors before moving on resulting in territory captured one day being lost the next day the worst fighting occurred in January of the new year as both sides grappled for control over minutica Square surrounded by five to nine-story buildings that made ideal positioning for snipers long-range duels were interspersed by frantic Close Quarters combat as chechens used tunnels and hidden crawl spaces to infiltrate Russian lines the tallest building in grozny was also located near the square and changed hands multiple times throughout the month but while Chechen control over grozny was slowly eroding Putin's control over the Russian government had become absolute after nearly a decade of struggling with severe alcoholism and heart disease Yeltsin had decided not to stand for re-election in the year 2000 but Yeltsin was in a conundrum as the office of president was the only thing protecting him from the vast horde of extremely rich enemies he had acquired in late 1999 Yeltsin summoned Putin to his private residence and made a deal in exchange for resigning and letting Putin become the acting president for the rest of his term Putin would Grant Yeltsin immunity from prosecution when he left the office Yeltsin resigned on New Year's Eve and that very evening Putin traveled to Dagestan and made speeches affirming his commitment to the war effort including the quote this is not just about restoring Russia's honor and dignity it's about putting an end to the breakup of the Russian Federation their resolve strengthened by the knowledge that they were now led by a relatively young healthy and highly energetic leader instead of the Aging sickly and horribly unpopular yelpson Russian troops continued to push into the Chechen Capital by January grozny had earned the highly prestigious title of the most fatal damaged City since the second world war with vast sections having been utterly obliterated by weeks of Russian shelling early January saw the fiercest fighting yet as the Chechen Rebels mounted a last-ditch counter-offensive that saw gorillas popping up Behind Enemy Lines in argon Gunder mass and shali by this point Russian paranoia was at an all-time high and there are many allegations of federation soldiers indiscriminately murdering civilians to root out disguised insurgents or simply out of sheer frustration at the continued Chechen Defiance just as it became clear grozny was a lost cause Shamil basayath arrived to personally coordinate a breakout attempt through the vast Russian Minefield encircling the city on the 29th basayath and his officers led the way through the mines marking the way for their beleaguered subordinates though many were wounded the majority were able to escape leaving the capital once again in the hands of the Invaders but this Retreat infuriated muscativ who had hoped to negotiate with the Russian officials while grozny still held to make matters worse many survivors of the battle crossed the border into neutral Georgia which the Russians cheerfully used as an excuse to conduct airstrikes into Georgian territory this sent a clear message to other nations in the caucuses demonstrating that Putin would not tolerate even passive cooperation with chechnya dashing moscatov's hopes of forming a Coalition in the region even the Americans cynically exploited the situation for their own benefit making a great show of offering Aid to the innocent Georgians while paying lip service at best to chechnya alone isolated and forced to rely on wanted terrorists for the defense of his country muskaidiff was in an untenable situation his every attempt at peace talks were sabotaged by Muslim radicals and the legitimacy of his government had been forever tainted by his association with men like visayath and al-katab having seized the capital the Russian army now spread out into the countryside to conduct mopping up operations most remaining pockets of opposition were holed up in the mountainous regions in the south of the country such as chateauy and vidino but even the largest of these consisted of a few hundred men at most and their ability to resist amounted to acts of sabotage and terrorism designed to make life as annoying for the occupiers as possible while the Chechen Insurgency clung to the faint Hope of Victory Vladimir Putin was being sworn in as president of the Russian Federation his policies in chechnya had been carefully spun by the media as the actions of a man determined to weld the various fragmentary parts of the Union back into a United cohesive whole thanks to this Putin secured an easy 53 percent of the popular vote just two months after his victory Putin placed chechnya under direct rule with a hand-picked pro-russian government taking office in the Blasted ruins of grozny but the real government of chechnya persisted with muscadev continuing to try and represent his Nation to the best of his abilities while in Exile however his credibility would be constantly sabotaged particularly by the events of 9 11. almost as soon as the attack occurred Putin called President Bush ostensibly to express condolences but also taking the time to imply a link between the Chechen resistance and Al-Qaeda by planting such seeds of Doubt Putin was able to keep in International pressure off of Russia while leaving the Chechen government isolated muscatv's last gasp came in 2002 when al-katab was assassinated by a poisoned letter by far the most extreme member of the Chechen resistance alcatab's death indirectly gave moscadev the political Capital needed to bring the eternally bickering Chechen guerrillas together one last time naturally basayv chose this exact moment to claim responsibility for a hostage taking at the nordost theater in Moscow since he was still commander-in-chief of chechnya's armed forces this extremely public link to a terrorist attack that resulted in hundreds of innocent deaths destroyed Moscato's stream of negotiation once and for all basayath would leave the Chechen government shortly thereafter but not before him and moscatov publicly denounced each other as Russian double agents 2002 was also the year the Russian army handed over combat duties against the insurgents to locally appointed militia groups made up of catching loyalists in October of 2003 the Chechen government installed by russian-elected Ahmad khadiraph as president khadiraph oversaw a referendum on the Constitution which included a motion to reintegrate with the Russian Federation debate over the wording of the Constitution was forbidden and over 80 000 Russian soldiers were also allowed to vote rendering the proceedings farcical to further emphasize just how little power the puppet government had khadiraph was killed in an explosion at grossney stadium in 2004 and the Kremlin reacted by putting his son ramzan through an emergency political education as his father's eventual successor 2004 also saw Aslan muscadov's death as he was tracked down by Russian Special Forces and killed by a grenade blast Shamil basayaf would last until 2006 when he too met an explosive End by accidentally triggering a mine while attempting to disarm it for various reasons it is impossible to definitively determine when the second Chechen war came to an end remnants of the Insurgency continue operating to this day and fragments of the ichiria government still cling to legitimacy in secluded corners of the caucuses however most place the end of the conventional conflict as occurring shortly after the fall of grozny while anti-terrorist operations continued into the late 2000s it is estimated that to this date around 7 000 Russians have been killed in combat with insurgents in exchange for around 16 000 Chechen casualties the civilian toll is up to 10 times higher with both sides accused of extensive war crimes against innocence and acts of terrorism by Chechen extremists having killed at least 600 Russians outside the borders of chechnya itself foreign\",\n",

clicking our Link in the description below the war between Japan and the Allied Powers lasted a total of three years and eight months from the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and its accompanying Asian Blitzkrieg to when the atom bombs fell though the War in China had been on for some time Japan's men in uniform did not find out about their country's surrender immediately veteran and Japanese prime minister tomishi morayama recalled that he and other soldiers heard the news hours after the radio announcement from our superiors At first I felt bad that we had lost but some of us were at the same time relieved because it was a long time coming while Japanese troops throughout the Pacific region would hear of their country's surrender over the next several weeks with the end of the war came the American occupation of Japan from August 1945 to May of 1952 a period of almost seven years Japan functioned as a colony during this period with no military or political Independence all decisions of the Neutered Japanese government had to be approved by the United States this was the world into which demobilized Japanese soldiers returned if they did at all the end of the war is usually associated with homecomings and happy reunions but for the Japanese soldier the end of the war meant uncertainty as he made his way back to a Homeland he no longer recognized while the conflict was ongoing the Japanese government made it extraordinarily difficult for captured soldiers to contact their families and propagandists in the military pushed the narrative that surrender was as dishonorable as it was impossible a Japanese soldier was expected to fight to the death and if for some reason he couldn't honor demanded he take his own life to surrender was not only to invite the greatest shame upon yourself but also to horribly dishonor your family and forfeit one's very identity as Japanese to spare their families they shame being associated with them returning Japanese pows would often not mention their capture to family and friends hiding what they were told was the most mortifying unforgivable sin they had ever committed in their lives foreign [Music] the Western allies had no interest whatsoever in keeping Japanese pows on hand unlike their German counterparts the Japanese were not leased out to reconstruct shattered infrastructure or press ganked to clear minefields the rump Japanese government called for their repatriation and in concert with the Americans had made Provisions for getting the demobilized men home repatriation began in December of 1945 with the sick or wounded ethnic Taiwanese or Koreans and all Japanese soldiers in China pushed to the front of the line the returning soldiers were forced to exchange any foreign money they'd come into for the rapidly crashing Yen but were far more eager to exchange their prison clothes for old uniforms while they waited for their turn to head home they were housed in either old Barracks or warehouses at their ports of entry with basic furniture and no protection from the chill of the Japanese winter conditions were squalid to the point that one returning Soldier noted he wished he'd stay in the Philippines when it came time for the repatriots to complete their Journey they were given enough money for a train fare and enough rations to see them through the arrival home was not always a happy one families of pows sometimes wrongly received notices of death an intentional distortion on the government's part so it's easy to imagine the emotional shock of seeing your dead husband brother or son walk through the front door the returning soldiers limped through these streets of their hometowns often still wearing Surplus uniforms given to them by their former captors and sometimes reduced to begging from American troops though many Japanese civilians privately supported their returning veterans the loss of the war and overnight restructuring of their society was too fresh of a wound and some soldiers were greeted with outright hostility by these same crowds that once cheered them as Heroes they came home quietly said toru Takaya a high school student at the time some of the soldiers told me that when they left to join the war everyone cheered and sent them off but when they came back there was nothing people looked at them coldly regardless of how they were received it was all too common for returning soldiers to suffer a psychological collapse and many who made it back to their hometowns simply walked into their homes closed the door and were never seen again [Music] the Soviet Union and Japanese empire had spent the war in a state of armed non-aggression each eyeing the other while dealing with the pressing matters of Nazi Germany and the United States respectively on August 15 1945 the Soviets defeated the quantang Army in Manchuria ending their war with Japan three days later Stalin ordered the transfer of all Japanese soldiers to the Soviet Union pows were stripped of all of their valuables by the Soviets left with only the clothes on their backs they would endure a long journey into the USSR punctuated by dragging marches between camps the site of Japanese women assaulted by Red Army troops and fijiers anti-jubilation of the natives at the Japanese defeat but at the end of it all they had optimism that they would eventually be returning home the attorneys were poorly cared for as the Soviets put their effort primarily towards stripping their newly acquired territory of anything of value being nakedly named committee on exporting trophy equipment from Manchuria oversaw the pilfering of Manchuria and other Japanese territories of anything regardless of size that could support the rebuilding of the Soviet economy leaving little food or supplies for the pows thanks to the efforts of the export committee huge Trains full of loot were soon steaming toward the Soviet Union with vast quantities of stolen War materiel were tens of thousands of Japanese pows these supremely unfortunate men were in for a terrible shock as some believed they were headed back home instead the Soviets took many of their charges to internment camps in Siberia the infamous Wilderness long used to house political prisoners and enemies of the state winter said in hard and early with temperatures dropping well below freezing fortunately these Soviets were careful to equip the transport trains with stoves and heating equipment when they were sent back in 1947. the Japanese who were transported to Siberia battled the elements on their own with those who touched the metal surfaces of their train cars losing the skin off their hands conditions were no better when they arrived at the camps themselves the extreme cold caused the Japanese soldiers bodies to go into survival mode increasing their blood circulation to Stave off frostbite but the increased activity also meant they could barely sleep when they tried the men huddled in Tangled masses not only to conserve body heat but because their Barracks were often overcrowded latrines were separated from the barracks and if a late night visit was required the returning pow would often find that his sleeping spot had been filled in by his fellows these probations meant that internees required medical attention and the camp infirmaries were staffed by many female doctors and nurses to the Japanese this was a humiliation as the female staff would inspect them from head to toe every month and shave them to prevent infestations of lice it must be noted that this was not part of some malevolent design to shame and psychologically wound the pows but rather a matter of necessity the Soviet Union had lost over 200 000 male medical personnel in the war and fully qualified women were available to make up the shortfall however these effects were present regardless of intent it is important at this moment to make a simple statement it is a fact of history that the Empire of Japan horribly abused civilians and pows alike throughout the war embarking on programs of forced labor human experimentation sexual exploitation and other cruelties Petty and expansive this Bears no denial the purpose of this examination is not to paint the Empire of Japan as a victim Nation but to explore the after effects of the second world war and it is incumbent on us to report them objectively the Soviets abused the Japanese as they abused the Germans as the Japanese abused the Chinese Filipinos Malaysians Vietnamese Dutch Americans British and so on while the camps in Siberia were certainly hellacious there were internment centers built all around the Soviet Union the central Asia regions of the USSR were home to camps that reached sweltering summer temperatures while some Japanese found themselves imprisoned in the underground wastes of verkuta wherever they were imprisoned the Japanese were expected to do their bit to rebuild the Soviet economy in the same breath as he ordered the initial internments in Siberia Stalin ordered that the Japanese pows be used as laborers to repair the damage they and their access Partners did to the workers Paradise the nkvd the Soviet Secret Police and precursor to the KGB was put in charge of dividing the pows into thousand-man labor battalions the vast majority of which were used to build roads lay Rail and construct or repair Bridges and other transport infrastructure others were put to work as industrial workers or Lumberjacks whatever would benefit the Soviet economy the variety and intensity of a pow's labor was a matter of chance what camp they were imprisoned in the effect the war had on the surrounding area how many workers were available and what would be the most advantageous to Stalin's plans the conditions of Labor were equally varied with some camps hosting a Workforce of relatively healthy internees who finished their tasks by midday while other camps hosted ill-car Ford men who regularly failed to meet quotas though their experiences were diverse all Japanese pows shared memories of the work being hard grueling and punishing Japanese soldiers who were in training or otherwise off the field of battle when surrender was announced were taken in by the Japanese government who wished to quickly and efficiently demobilize them despite their junior position in the power Dynamic the government in Tokyo pushed to get these men processed employed and back to civilian life American authorities assessed them for what skills they could bring to the post-war country with those possessing valuable training in civilian trades sent home before others skills also determined the amount of rations and other Goods the government would issue a demobilized soldier as more and more soldiers came home the Japanese government steered them toward jobs in the Agricultural and Industrial sectors incentivizing businesses to hire returning veterans others were enlisted as laborers for the American occupiers Servicing vehicles and working to rebuild the broken Japanese transport system the headquarters of the American occupation in beppu was built with no small amount of demobilized Labor and Japanese workers were a fixture in the building's kitchen but some Japanese who weren't captured took a different attack for them the war was not over at its height the Japanese empire controlled over 20 million square miles or roughly 51 million square kilometers of territory such expansive Holdings naturally meant that news of surrender was slow to reach isolated garrisons and positions especially in the remotest jungles and Island groups isolated and filled with Warrior Spirit some groups of soldiers fought on either unaware or unheeding of the surrender one such lone soldier was Corporal suichi yokoi who lived in the jungles of Guam for 28 years as a holdout when the U.S retook Guam yokoi's regiment was all but annihilated and he was recorded as one of the dead he lived in solitude until a pair of fishermen discovered yokoi checking shrimp traps along a river yokoi attacked the fishermen and was subdued by the Anglers who to yokoi's surprise took him home and fed him rather than dispatched the lone Warrior yokoi was ultimately demobilized in 1972 and wrote a book about his years in the jungle but the most famous of these cases was the Detachment of Lieutenant Hiro onoda whose small group conducted a guerrilla war against the Philippine government until 1974 when the now lone onoda was coaxed out of hiding and formally relieved of Duty by his very much retired commanding officer like the Nazis the Japanese committed a variety of crimes against humanity that demanded prosecution war criminals were imprisoned near where they were captured with jails in Hong Kong Burma Singapore and the Dutch East Indies holding those awaiting trial the prisoner of war information Bureau or p-o-w-i-b was a key participant in preparing for trials in that they actively interfered in the process Japanese authorities encouraged the pow IB to withhold information from Allied prosecutors a demand the ostensibly neutral body ascented to categorizing their files on pows and their personal histories as for Active Release and release only if required the situation was further Complicated by both the pow IB and Japanese government lacking English-speaking Personnel who could interface with the American occupation forces and other Allied Leaders the Potsdam declaration which laid out the terms of Japanese surrender declared there must be eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest and to this end the Tokyo trials were convened 28 members of the Japanese government including military dictator and Survivor of a failed suicide attempt Hideki Tojo stood trial for a Litany of Horrors stretching from the time the first Japanese soldiers stepped onto Chinese soil through the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the proceedings lasted until 1948 by which time two defendants died of natural causes seven of the 28 were sentenced to death including the aforementioned Tojo the 28 at the Tokyo trials were considered Class A or highly ranking war criminals thousands of lesser offenders were tried in municipal courts throughout Allied territories in the Pacific the Tokyo trials ultimately lasted two times as long as their counterpart in Nuremberg and were similarly effective in the establishment of international law concerning crimes against humanity the Empire of Japan entered the second world war to create a zone of hegemony in Asia but would leave the war a ruined Nation her soldiers coming home in shame were being shipped off to labor camps in the Soviet Union Japan would never wage an offensive War again and would effectively be an American puppet state until 1952. The Fallout of Japan's defeat is especially sad a depressing end to an orgy of violence and hatred with few peers in the journals of man's inhumanity to man [Music] [Music] [Music]\",\n",
       " \" hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian the strategy of the Red Army during the second world war is one of the most analyzed yet misrepresented topics in history films and games often portray the Soviets mindlessly throwing themselves against their enemies and ordered to be shot by their own officers if the men refused orders these myths were primarily perpetuated by German officers seeking to slander their enemies and in this video we'll analyze both the highs and lows of Joseph Stalin's war effort how he both helped and hindered his nation and how his commanders performed under his leadership if they weren't already dismissed one of the few good decisions made by the USSR before the second world war was the adoption of the one-time pad system an encryption

Soviets including the losses of 48 000 tanks 167 000 guns and 77 000 aircraft on the other hand Soviet military casualties were around 16 million with another 16 million civilian deaths of these figures Germany suffered around 3 million killed in action to the Soviet Union's 8 million killed in action an unbelievable 14 of its total population of all the powers involved in the second world war the USSR not only suffered by far the highest losses it also suffered a far higher proportion killed in action as a direct result of the conflict yet despite this colossal body count the USSR not only emerged Victorious but went on to become a global superpower to explain how the Soviets could simultaneously suffer such losses yet still somehow be on The Winning Side we will first explore its leadership then move down the chain of command to see how individual war strategies were implemented all power within the USSR was centralized around a single figure Joseph Stalin not a single decision was made without Stalin's approval either directly or indirectly notoriously paranoid and suspicious Stalin entered the second world war having just spent three years conducting the infamous Great Purge which saw over half of the officers in the Red Army imprisoned or killed but while some genuinely seditious elements were exposed the purges also spilled an ocean of innocent blood totaling at least seven hundred thousand Army personnel and sixty thousand high-ranking officers Stalin was obsessed with ideologically purifying his nation of all non-soviet influencers even if that meant killing men deemed too intelligent to make reliable underlings these murderous prejudices deeply affected the Soviet military Doctrine as many officers were killed simply for proposing changes influenced by capitalist thought processes promotion relied on adherence to proper communist ideals while any demonstration of genuine Talent OR leadership ability amounted to a death sentence surprisingly enough at the same time the Red Army was suffering through the worst of the purges it was also seeing an unprecedented period of growth and rearmament while historians have frequently debated Stalin's motives and geopolitical Outlook during the 1930s the majority agree that he foresaw a major conflict within the next decade and he had no intention of presiding over another disastrous defeat this illustrates the strange dualistic nature of Stalin's War preparations which saw him pouring vast resources into the military while simultaneously ripping out its teeth to ensure it couldn't be used against him Stalin also actively courted the attention of Adolf Hitler several high-ranking defectors have claimed Stalin believed a new world war would trigger socialist uprisings in Europe which the USSR would sweep to the aid of others have claimed that Stalin couldn't care less about International socialism but instead wanted to recapture the various tsarist territories that splintered from Russia during the revolution still others believe Stalin held Hitler in very high regard considering him a kindred spirit thanks to their shared authoritarian values regardless of Stalin's real motives he planned on keeping the USSR out of conflict until it was ready to fight an offensive War sometime in the 1940s thanks to his close diplomatic ties with Nazi Germany Stalin gained the molotov ribbon Trot pact in August of 1939 which included a secret protocol dividing Eastern Europe between the two Powers after war broke out in September the Red Army moved into the eastern half of Poland with Little Resistance Stalin then turned his attention to Finland whose administration contained many white russian Exiles after Finland refused to cede its border territories and join the soviet-led Bloc in the Baltic Stalin ordered an invasion only to witness his hand-crafted Red Army take nearly four to one casualties against the determined Finnish Defenders confronted with a butcher's bill of nearly 170 000 men Stalin was forced to sit down with his top military commanders and begin inquiries into analyzing the disaster unsurprisingly these revealed a shocking lack of initiative amongst Soviet commanders embarrassingly poor coordination between units a total inability to rapidly communicate with Frontline troops and massive logistical issues enormous reforms in both Doctrine and Equipment were required but serious problems continued to go unaddressed Chief among them were the political commissars who held the power to execute officers for practically any reason given his extremely weak military position and the ease with which the clearly rotten Western democracies were failing beneath the heel of the German jackboot Stalin realized he needed time to consolidate his gains and avoid additional Bloodshed for now but this caused Stalin to become unhealthily obsessed with preserving peace with Germany his belief that Hitler would not invade while at war with Great Britain was initially reasonable but he clung to it far beyond the point of rationality even rejecting intelligence from his own agents in Berlin and Tokyo in a report from laverenty birya regarding the prospect of an invasion Stalin wrote you can tell your Source from the German air headquarters that he can go and his mother this is not a source but disinformation in a similar display of maturity Stalin responded to the perfectly accurate reports from agent Richard Sorge in Tokyo that nine armies would attack the USSR on the 22nd of June by calling him a little Stalin also believed that even if the unthinkable did happen his existing defenses could hold out until a full mobilization said defenses consisted of a Thin Red Line of Divisions stretched across the vast Soviet border territories all with orders never to retreat and no radios to coordinate a retreat anyway fortunately some officers of the Red Army foresaw the inevitable and risked their lives to prepare for a German attack on May 15th General Alexander vasilevsky worked with giorgi zhukov and Simeon timashenka to formulate a strategy that called for the Red Army to absorb the German attack and then counter-attack to destroy the bulk of enemy forces and fight the war on foreign soil the plan proposed a preemptive strike against The Invasion force and requested Stalin permit a covert mobilization Stalin either never read the plan or instantly rejected it but even experienced generals substantially underestimated the speed of the German buildup and it was only on the 21st of June that Stalin finally issued an alert order which reached the front lines a whole one hour before the attack began even in this last communique Stalin showed his reluctance to believe the obvious by saying the task of our troops is not to respond to any provocative actions that might result in serious complications at 3 15 a.m on the 22nd of June 1941 over 3 million German troops crashed through the Soviet border defenses with unstoppable Force the Red Army was caught in the middle of major reforms and commanders failed to exercise even the most rudimentary coordination between infantry and artillery Stalin himself was completely blindsided by The Invasion and wasted precious hours entertaining the notion that it was all a hideous mistake when he came to his senses his first moves were to order the evacuation of Soviet industry to the euros and establish a general Supreme command or stafka with himself at the top but Stalin allegedly suffered a breakdown on the 28th after the fall of Minsk and fled to his private residence outside of Moscow after two whole days in solitude a delegation of senior Soviet officials convinced him to return whereupon he threw himself into organizing a series of massive counter-offensives while doubling down on his policy of No Retreat and no surrender this culminated in order 270 which read in part those falling into encirclements are to fight to the last those who prefer to surrender are to be destroyed by all available means the order was enforced by Stalin's political commissars who were empowered to countermand the orders of operational commanders and administer summary executions without trial on July 3rd he addressed his Nation for the first time since the start of the invasion and called for A Patriotic War he also recognized the British as allies declaring the conflict part of a united front of people's standing for freedom this speech marked a turning point in Stalin's attitudes as he began to replace ideological sentiment with patriotism emphasizing this as a grand struggle for these Soviet people rather than a battle between communism and fascism ironically enough it was perhaps Hitler's unswerving dedication to the extermination of the Slavic people that helped Stalin power through his darkest moments leaving him with a binary Choice except certain death or fight as hard as possible to avert it while Hitler's early victories convinced him that he was a military genius Stalin's early defeats shook him back to a semblance of reality though he continued ordering failed counter-offensives throughout 1941 he also reached out to other allied powers and began essential negotiations for supplies and military aid these diplomatic overtures would be Stalin's greatest contribution to the war ensuring that the Red Army had the international backing necessary to absorb the horrific early losses inflicted by Operation Barbarossa however it should not be assumed that Stalin was the source of all military issues within the USSR even at his worst he did listen to advice from his generals and many supported his tactical decisions even giorgi zhukov wrote in his Memoirs we did not think that our armed forces would be such a failure at the start of the war and suffer such serious defeats in the first battles that they would be forced to retreat into the interior of the country and at that time our military theoretical science generally did not consider the profound problems of Strategic Defense mistakenly considering it not so important the entire Soviet military command fully subscribed to the doctrine of offensive action supported by mechanized units and many supported Stalin's insistence on no retreat even from obviously hopeless battles many officers were also obsessed with the idea of avoiding defeatism which led to absurd scenarios like General Clement varashilov refusing a massive food Convoy for the besieged city of Leningrad because it gave the impression that the city was undersupplied as the Germans began knocking at the gates of Moscow Stalingrad and Leningrad Marshals like zhukov timashanka and vasilevsky were busy Reinventing the core doctrines of the Red Army Air power was concentrated into large centrally coordinated air armies that could flexibly respond to a rapidly evolving strategic situation while ground forces were finally freed from the oppressive hand of the political commissars in September of 1942 promotion by Merit was resumed as was the distribution of metals for valorous conduct to shore up morale and prevent desertions veteran blocking detachments were stationed in the rear of Soviet divisions these blocking detachments were examples of morale ant discipline to nervous conscripts as they detained fleeing soldiers operated as emergency reserves and restored the cohesion of routing units on a strategic level the Red Army embraced the concept of deep operations which contrasted the German Blitzkrieg by emphasizing large-scale combined arms Warfare across a vast front depleting enemy reserves and exhausting their logistical capabilities commanders like zhukov and vasilevsky also became masters of mosqueirovka an institutionalized art of deception and misinformation that sought to fool German armies as to the size and intent of their Soviet counterpart this strategy was enhanced by Stalin's diplomatic efforts granting access to the Allied code breaking Network and vital insight into German strategic intentions another common myth about the Red Army is its Reliance on chaotic human wave tactics to drown out their qualitatively Superior German foes the truth is much more nuanced first rifles and other Small Arms were plentiful men were not sent in without a weapon against fortified positions as movies and games like to depict and though Mass assault tactics were used in some capacity it was as a last resort when all other options were unavailable and the instant that the Red Army adopted the radio improving coordination they all but ceased to occur furthermore deep operation Warfare emphasized the grand strategic picture rather than the outcome of individual battles therefore if the Red Army suffered technical defeats in 10 minor battles but inflicted enough losses on the German Army to keep it from winning one decisive engagement the Red Army retained an overall strategic advantage the one Doctrine the Soviet leadership had kept sacred throughout its tumultuous early years was that of total mobilization alongside the absolute prioritization of military Recruitment and production this attitude paid dividends during the war as it enabled combat losses to be replaced at a phenomenal rate further adding to the illusion that the USSR had a bottomless well of Manpower in reality the German Army had a numerical advantage in operation Barbarossa and the scales only tipped toward the Red Army after 1941. throughout most of the war the Red Army failed to meet the three to one numerical Advantage most military thinkers believe necessary to counter a defender's Advantage yet was still able to wage the largest offensive war in history many reports also conflate numbers of active personnel with reservists who hadn't even been called up yet only by early 1943 did the Red Army outnumber the Vermont and by the time the Soviet tanks rolled into Berlin this advantage had reached four to one by late 1944 the Red Army had reached its Zenith while Hitler was busy micromanaging his forces reassigning generals on a whim and generally interfering at every level of military operations Stalin had relaxed his grip on the reins of power just enough to let his now veteran officers prosecute the war as they saw fit Soviet offensives now began with careful planning and deception followed by an initial wave of attacks that seized key positions and compromised the Integrity of the whole enemy defensive Network these initial thrusts were accompanied by Titanic artillery barrages and vast air attacks that rolled ahead of the main Advance while Mass tank formations punched holes through the disordered Enemy Lines Soviet field officers were now able to race their forces through the resulting salience and respond to emerging threats with speed and discipline the Battle of Kursk was the perfect example of all these new ideas coming to fruition involving extensive campaigns reception to fool the Germans into striking and heavily reinforced sections of the Soviet line while vast tank and infantry columns tore across the open step Under A Sky Full of ground attack aircraft this new Dynamic approach to Warfare would enable such Feats as the lightning invasion of Manchuria a brilliantly coordinated assault across a virtually unindustrialized land mass with Soviet forces penetrating as deep as the Korean peninsula in less than two weeks the USSR presents a fascinating case study into a nation that entered the largest conflict in human history in perhaps the worst position possible ruled by a paranoid autocrat with practically no military experience the Soviet Union paid a huge price during Operation Barbarossa and continued seeing defeats well into early 1943 but with each loss the Red Army learned from its mistakes methodically planning how to get the most use out of every individual Soldier Stalin also learned to trust his military commanders to do their job without micromanagement something his Nazi counterpart never grasped the Red Army went from a state of near Anarchy at the start of the conflict to inflicting the overwhelming majority of German casualties and swiftly invading Japanese Manchuria in only 10 days [Music] [Music]\",\n",

concern when hostilities broke out in July of 1914 American ambassador to France Myron T Herrick advocated taking an active role in mediation expression from our nation would have great weight in this crisis a strong plea for delay and moderation from the president of the United States would meet with the respect and approval of Europe President Wilson called for neutrality on an existential level exhorting all Americans to observe neutrality in thought and indeed to this end the government prohibited American Banks from loaning money to any belligerent Nation an act that the then Secretary of State and noted gold hater William Jennings Bryan hoped would both cement American neutrality and bring the war to a speedy conclusion one cannot fight with an empty War chest after all this fiscal neutrality was not long-lived as President Wilson reversed the decision in 1915 in response to the British Empire indicating their stockpiles of cash were about to run out and thus they could not afford to continue buying American Goods though protesting its neutrality at each turn the United States was all too Keen to do business with the Anton with the metaphorical floodgates opened American creditors sent a veritable tsunami of greenbacks to the British Empire who turned right around and spent that money in the United States but the British were not the only foreign Shoppers in American markets as the German Empire too sought to buy critical supplies from Uncle Sam with the Western Front grinding to a stalemate Germany hired ships from neutral countries to Ferry food and other necessities purchased in the United States to the continent but British Naval Supremacy and their blockade of Germany prevented much of it from getting through the United States formally protested the British blockade in March of 1915 but the issue was quietly resolved in a meeting that saw the United States accept a British prohibition on selling food to Germany when the blockade began impacting American cotton exports and threatening a vital pillar of the economy Britain agreed to increase their cotton purchases to cover the shortfall the upshot of all of this economic backroom dealing was an ostensibly neutral United States bowing to any small pressure from the British Empire to stop selling to Germany between 1914 to 1916 American trade with the German Empire plummeted by an economy shattering 99 percent Germany backed to an economic wall ordered a submarine blockade of Great Britain in retaliation the United States protested declaring this to be a violation of international law this double standard accepting a British blockade of Germany but not a German blockade of Britain was acknowledged and waved Away by President Wilson who claimed that the British Navy did not threaten American lives in the same way that Germany's powerful Fleet of submarines did Wilson was unaware that Germany had only nine submarines with which to enforce its blockade hardly the mammoth threat to American life that he seemed to imagine but the threat was still there as the sinking of the Lusitania on March 7 1915 would throw into sharp relief [Music] foreign the sinking of the RMS Lusitania which killed 128 American citizens was only one in a series of incidents that drove the American people further and further into the antonce camp the American public already displeased at reports of German atrocities in Belgium condemned the apparent sinking of a civilian vessel and a diplomatic back and forth between Washington and Berlin ensued calls to enter the war rang in the halls of the capital stopped only by German promises to scale back their submarine operations America was pacified for now but German Americans began to face Prejudice at home Prejudice that would only intensify as the war progressed doubts of German Americans loyalty would be continuously raised with President Wilson declaring that any man who carries a hyphen with him carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this Republic when he gets ready a nakedly hostile remark towards the largest non-english speaking group in the United States at the time government stoked and homegrown paranoia escalated into violence with German Americans shot forced from their homes or lynched such as the case of Robert Paul proger a naturalized citizen who was lynched as a spy in April of 1918. this hatred was further stoked by an incredible Act of sabotage as previously mentioned the Anton funneled much money to Yankee businesses including Munitions plants Germany unable to buy American Weaponry thanks to the British blockade began sending spies to find where the Anton was procuring and transporting weapons and munition and to Halt the flow of materiel if possible one such Point of Departure was black Tom Island in New York Harbor and on July 30th 1916 German agents decided to have a little fireworks show igniting over 20 million dollars worth of stockpile Munitions the Germans created one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in human history a Shockwave equivalent to a magnitude 5 earthquake was felt as far away as Philadelphia the Statue of Liberty was damaged and black Tom Island was devastated 110 by 50 meter crater left behind by the blast momentum was steadily building for the United States to enter the war and in a display of military Acumen that would make Von Bismarck proud German planners determined that the best way to keep the United States from entering Wars was to actively Target their merchant shipping and threaten American lives their rationale was simple bringing back unrestricted submarine warfare and sinking every ship headed to Britain American or not would starve the ontant into submission and end the war before the United States could even be moved to intervene American ships were sunk but President Wilson just barely re-elected continued to demur instead proclaiming armed neutrality by ordering American ships to be armed and authorized to fire on any aggressor as their ships were raided and more were lost the American public began clamoring for more than just armed neutrality President Wilson continued to resist but his efforts were ended by the infamous Zimmerman Telegram an order by the German foreign minister to his men in Mexico to court America's Southern neighbor with Promises of recovering territory in Texas Arizona and New Mexico if they would invade the United States for the Central Powers President Wilson faced with all of these pressures asked his cabinet for advice and found a single word on all of his advisors lips both houses of the United States Congress passed resolutions supporting a war on Germany and President Wilson formally requested Congress acknowledge a state of War had been created by Germany's actions rather than declare war outright Congress responded by declaring war outright on April 6 1917. neutrality had ended and it was time to go over there foreign the United States that entered the first world war was far from a military power isolationism had taken its toll on America's Armed Forces leaving President Wilson to call up a minuscule standing army and dust off a Navy of Aging battleships this in a way suited the president just fine as Wilson believed the simple Act of entering the war would tip the balance of power firmly in the favor of the Anton while the British and French clamored for a fight to the Finish Wilson had his gaze fixed firmly on bringing the Germans to the negotiating table and truly making this the war to end all wars with the passage of The Selective Service Act widespread conscription swelled the Americans numbers two million men had volunteered at the outbreak of war and conscription would see 2.8 million more go over there whether volunteers or conscripts Yankee troops began making their way to Europe American troops landed on European Shores in June of 1917. British and French commanders initially viewed the newly arrived Americans as reinforcements they could use to supplement their dwindling numbers some black soldiers including the famous Harlem Hellfighters were folded into the French army for the duration of the war but General John Blackjack Pershing Infamous pacifier of the Philippines and commander of the American expeditionary Force sought to keep his men together in a unified American Army Pershing would largely get his way and the first major engagement fought by the Americans would come the following summer the Battle of continent a German Salient at the Village of continent represented a golden opportunity to Pershing who committed the first Infantry Division better known as The Big Red One to wipe it out this strike would not only consolidate on taunt Lions but Pershing hoped seeing the Americans in action would boost French confidence in their American comrades at 6 45 am on May 28 1918 American infantry Advanced under cover of French artillery French tanks and flamethrower detachments Advanced alongside the Yanks and the combined Force Advanced up these slopes of Continuum despite the help of the French Gunners tankers and air support the Americans were mauled during the uphill battle yet they succeeded in capturing the village German counter-attacks began not long thereafter but the Americans held firm turning back two days of offensives and keeping a firm grip on Contin the Americans accomplished their objective of not only taking the village but also demonstrating that they could be counted on in a scrap that scrap would come at Bello wood a German offensive punched a hole in French lines and the U.S Marines were sent to plug the Gap pushing back the German assault and repelling numerous attempts to reopen the hole from there the Marines assaulted critical German positions in and around Bellow wood taking heavy casualties but accomplishing their objectives it was among the Trees of Bello that Marine lore could be written Captain Williams refusal to retreat has become the motto of the fifth Marines but Bella Wood and continuity were only the Prelude to the largest offensive and American military history to that point from September 26th to November 11th 1.2 million American troops embarked on the Muse argon offensive aimed at capturing the Railhead at Sudan the offensive hit immediate stumbling blocks as the Americans deployed inexperienced units already weakened by the Spanish Flu as the battle dragged on both the Americans and the French sent troops to shore up the line the Anton Spirits would be lifted by an incredible Act of heroism Corporal Alvin York a sharp shooting infantryman from the 82nd infantry now the 82nd Airborne killed 25 and captured 132 Germans a feat that would earn him the Medal of Honor in a bid to break the stalemate The Big Red One assaulted the German stronghold at Cote du ChatOn an imposing position that American Lieutenant General Robert Bullard described thus not a line a net four kilometers deep wire interlaced knee-high and grass wire Tangled devilishly in forests pillboxes in succession one covering

failed cracking quotes du chattion and turning the tide of the offensive just in time for the Armistice to be signed on November 11th America would prove as active in peace as they were in the final days of the war President Wilson brought his 14 points to the negotiations at Versailles and pushed for these principles to provide the Bedrock for the post-war World Wilson envisioned A League of Nations that would promote Global Peace and provide a diplomatic alternative to fighting Wilson also sought to impose his peaceableness on Europe as a whole dismantling the Old Colonial system and promoting self-determination for All Peoples across the world but Wilson's ideas were not universally accepted with the previously mentioned Secretary of State Lansing remarking that promoting self-determination would raise hopes which can never be realized and that the phrase is simply loaded with dynamite the British and French were equally skeptical with the French representative only reading Wilson's points when the German delegation requested that they be the basis of the peace talks fearing that the Americans and Germans would conclude a separate piece based on Wilson's ideas the French and British accepted the 14 points as Germany requested Wilson became quite popular for his peacemaking image and his League of Nations was formally established in 1920 but neither the Treaty of Versailles which ended the first world war nor the United States entry into the League of Nations were approved by Congress a sign that isolationism had returned to America's Shores America's war was over for now participation in the war to end all wars brought America onto the world stage in an unprecedented fashion but the Public's desire to return to a quiet isolation dashed any hopes that President Wilson had of his country leading the world into a new era of peace and international cooperation the League of Nations would go on to crumble under the weight of its members indifference to its decisions specifically the open Defiance of the Japanese empire in the 1930s German Americans came out of the war brow beaten into hiding their culture and assimilating while

       " \" hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian during the Great War the Imperial German Navy was one of the largest military organizations on Earth but after Decades of operating with a nearly unlimited budget the Kaiser's Grand fleet was ignominiously scuttled after the German surrender in this video we'll see how the Kaiser's successors began working in secret to restore their nation's position as a major Naval power and how various strategies and goals were examined During the interwar period and how Admirals like Eric Rader worked to establish a coherent plan for German Naval Supremacy on the high seas only to see it collapse in the face of mismanagement resource shortages and the Eternal bickering between the three main branches of the military special thanks to the sponsor of today's video Warpath keep that mg firing boys damn we are pinned down hard and do something time to level up the squad we also need better weapons right now cool an m1903 Springfield just what we need time to relocate sniper go are they immerse yourself in the campaign and watch your men progress from raw recruits to hardened veterans equip your army with a vast arsenal of authentic weapons and help them evolve into an elite fighting force use real tactics and strategies to outmaneuver surround and flank your enemies set foot on the warpath make strategic alliances and rewrite history by downloading the game today following the signing of the Treaty of Versailles the Weimar Republic was allowed only a handful of obsolete surface vessels submarines were banned as was a Naval Aviation program furthermore public perception of the Navy was overwhelmingly negative with many critics going so far as to surely blame the Imperial German Navy for having lost the war with virtually no funding or public support the disgraced Veterans of the high seas Fleet were forced to go back to the drawing board digging deep into their archives to try and figure out exactly where they had gone wrong and more importantly what they could do better next time from the late 1910s to the mid-1920s the new reichs Marina dispatched students across the globe to attend various foreign Naval academies while high ranking officers conducted yearly war games and wrote in-depth treatises on all manner of subjects one particularly prolific publicist was vice admiral Wolfgang Wagner whose collected works entitled Naval strategy in the world war highlighted the Strategic importance of Denmark and to Norway whose harbors and airfields could be used as forward bases to strike at the Atlantic trade routes he also pointed out that Germany had utterly failed to cut Britain off from Maritime trade leaving it with no leverage over its enemies as a result the Imperial Navy's only major Fleet engagement had occurred at the inconclusive Battle of Jutland which ultimately did nothing to change the status quo wagoner's arguments were strongly based on the works of American naval officer Alfred Thayer Mann and postulated that future success would require the German Navy to seize French ports on the English Channel disrupt the Atlantic trade routes and create a situation where the Royal Navy was forced into a decisive engagement on German terms where it could be destroyed once and for all standing in Stark opposition to the main veganer School of thinking was Admiral Eric Rader who had no expectation of Germany being able to face the Royal Navy on even terms again until at least the late 1940s Raider instead endorsed the idea of a small but flexible force of coastal defense vessels sufficient to protect German assets backed up by a fleet of Commerce Raiders Cruisers and small aircraft carriers that could operate anywhere on the high seas his assertion was that such a fleet composition would force the Royal Navy to adopt Convoy tactics and spread its resources out across a broad front which qualitatively Superior German warships could then exploit too slowly but surely gain Victory the largest expansion of German Naval power under the Republic took place in 1929 when the construction of the three Deutschland class Panzer Schiffer heavy Cruisers began the deutschlands were designed as anti-blockade ships capable of easily defeating smaller Cruisers and older battleships while outrunning newer battleships they were also blatantly in violation of the Versailles treaty being nearly 3 000 tons over the displacement limit of 10 000. far more secretive was the reich's Marina's U-Boat program made of a core of Veteran officers from the Great War who conspired to not only keep their Traditions alive but contribute to whole new designs that would form the basis of Nazi Germany's underwater flotilla amongst this Cadre was Carl Donuts a man whose illustrious career would see him rise to the leadership of the Third Reich itself history however would not force the Kaiser's veterans to toil in obscurity for much longer after dismantling the Weimar Republic and instituting his new German Reich in 1933 Adolf Hitler began pouring money into new military projects including the reichs marina which he would rename to the kriegs marina in 1935. prior to this Admiral Rader had his first personal conversation with the fuhrer in April of 1933 and the first plans for a small escort-class carrier were drawn up just a few months later this marked a shift in German Naval strategy away from defensive Warfare and towards domination over the Atlantic it also marked the beginning of a tangled snarl of dead end designs misappropriated materials and convoluted expansion plans that would render the kriegs marina a pale shadow of what it could have been Chief amongst these boondoggles would be the carrier program which by 19 34 three 15 000 ton vessels whose designs included several turrets and a proposed range of 12 000 nautical miles this was almost immediately curtailed to two carriers after the signing of the anglo-german naval treaty in 1935 limited The Creeks Marina to 35 percent of the royal Navy size this treaty was considered essential at the time as the now General Admiral Eric Rader believed that parody with the Royal Navy was impossible for at least a decade fortunately Raider could rest easy thanks to Hitler's solemn and sincere promise that war with Great Britain was not even a consideration and work on the first carrier later known as the graph Zeppelin began in December of 1936. while arguments about the German carrier Force raged back and forth the newly promoted Admiral Carl Donuts was busy building up Germany's U-Boat flotilla spurred on by his unrelenting belief that it would be the key to strangling British Commerce the anglo-german naval treaty had permitted the expansion of the submarine Fleet and donuts quickly determined that the type 7 design was the most flexible overall while the far larger type 9 was best in the west Mediterranean but the submarine program would have its own issues with contracts for Gigantic multi-targeted Cruiser submarines being enthusiastically endorsed by older Admirals with absolutely no idea what they were doing this highlighted another issue that the kriegs marina was facing a lack of large diesel engines under Raiders strategic Vision diesel-powered Capital ships could race across the Atlantic and sweep aside any smaller vessels they encountered unfortunately even the Vata German engineering companies were unable to construct such gigantic generators forcing Germany to fall back on traditional steam engines nevertheless Germany continued pushing the technological envelope and in 1936 The Kills of the iconic Bismarck and terpits were laid down with both to be equipped with radar and Fire Control Systems and catapults for reconnaissance float planes by late 1937 Hitler realized that war with Great Britain was likely and called for an expansion of the kriegs marina War Games determined that smaller carriers were best suited to the kind of Commerce rating operations against the Royal Navy but new designs would not be ready for years on the other hand Donuts was busy using radio technology to introduce the concept of wolf pack tactics to his submarine Fleet this involved squadrons of U-boats working together to attack enemy targets from multiple angles while coordinating their movements via radio Transmissions to and from a centralized command station on the mainland Donuts also exhaustively drilled his men in nighttime surface attack operations something no other submarine fleet was training for at the time 1938 would see the incomplete Groth Zeppelin being symbolically launched in a grand ceremony that failed to disguise the fact that she had no planes no fire control system and that Hermann Goring would rather have seen her explode in the harbor and hand over a single pilot to The Creeks Marina as these storm clouds grew over Europe the kriegs marina embraced the idea of operational flexibility resulting in both the double pole strategy and the notorious plan Z the double pole approach emphasized single high endurance warships Waging War against British commercial interests while two small battle groups maintained control of the North Sea with a carrier each plan Z meanwhile was a last-ditch effort for parody with the Royal Navy approved by Hitler in January 1939. plan Z mandated the construction of an enormous new force that included 10 battleships four carriers 15 Panzer Schiffer and many other vessels but plan Z assumed war with Britain wouldn't occur until 1944 and was canceled the instant war broke out in September of 1939. ultimately the kriegs marina would enter the second world war as a third-rate naval power at best as Raider himself wrote in his diary we are not in a position to play anything like an important part in the war against Britain's Commerce Donuts was also horrified by the outbreak of hostilities having only about 24 Atlantic proof U-boats operational and no warm water ports to service them in Winter even so the kriegs marina would quickly swing into action while it lacked a powerful surface Navy it did enter the war with a number of mine layers that were able to clog up the English Coast Baltic Coast and West Frisian islands with explosives that would continue to cause losses well into 1944. another surprising success were the hilfs kreitzers a force of 10 auxiliary Cruisers AKA militarized Merchant men though no match for a real warship the helps greitzers proved astonishingly cost effective requiring a mere 3000 Sailors to crew every ship and able to operate across the world the helps kreitzers would eventually sink 850 000 tons worth of Allied Shipping putting them nearly on par with the the whole rest of the surface Fleet in terms of total tonnage sunk the older ships such as the Deutschland class Panzer Schiffer had a far worse track record with the Admiral Groth spay being trapped and scuttled in the river Plata after a brief anti-shipping operation in the South Atlantic the lack of diesel engines also limited the range of heavy Commerce Raiders HIPAA and Prince Oregon perhaps the most significant contribution by the kriegs marina to the early stages of the war occurred during operation vaserubung aka the invasion of Norway and Denmark where they provided transport and fire support for the Vermont like most German operations in 1940 theyza Ruben was a huge Gamble and the resulting loss of 10 destroyers one heavy and two light Cruisers was deemed acceptable to secure Sweden's iron ore and Norwegian heavy water another blow was dealt to the Royal Navy when the two fast battleships Sean forest and gonis now easily sank the carrier HMS glorious while German cryptologists were able to crack British Naval codes and locate many Merchant convoys by early 1941 the kriegs marina had arguably reached its Zenith thanks to gaining full access to the ports in occupied France and churning out new submarines at a rate of 16 per month allowing large wolf packs to roam A Thousand Mile width of sea beyond the reach of Allied air cover this was known as the happy time when British sonar and radar was rarely encountered and the convoy system was still unrefined leading to many easy kills the surface Fleet also saw major successes with the battle Cruisers scharnhorst and gonizenal disrupting the transatlantic Trade Network but Naval resources kept being diverted towards supporting the land war with the Soviet Union while the British broke the Enigma code in the spring leading to a major uptick in U-Boat losses before the morse code Wheels were added Raider and many other commanders believed their time would be better spent in the Mediterranean where they could cooperate with the Italian Navy in operations against Malta and Gibraltar this was the only theater of the war outside of the Pacific where the axes held local Naval superiority for a time and Raider felt this could be transformed into total Regional Supremacy but Raiders lofty dreams would never come true as the loss of the battleship Bismarck during his maiden voyage dealt a huge blow to the surface Fleet and was compounded when its Supply ships were also located and sunk this left donuts and his submarine Corps to pick up the slack which he did commendably sending over 8 million tons of Allied chips to the bottom of the ocean between 1941 and 1942. the entry of America into the second world war also marked a high point in U-Boat success rates as the American admiralty stubbornly refused to adopt the convoy system maintain radio silence or black out their cities this led to what German U-Boat captains would call the second happy time as submarines roamed back and forth among the American Coastline sinking dozens of undefended merchant ships that were perfectly silhouetted against the bright lights of coastal cities as the war dragged on Admiral Rader found himself being supplanted by Donuts whose ubo fleet was now operating at Peak strength while the surface Fleet had all but stagnated with most of the kriegs Marina's resources now devoted to submarines Raider was barely able to convince Hitler to resume work on the Graf Zeppelin in 1942 winter of that year saw 100 active duty submarines sinking 627 000 tons of Allied Shipping but in May the tides turned dramatically as the Enigma machines failed to keep up with advances in Allied cryptology resulting in most U-Boat positions being identified within one month 47 U-boats were lost forcing a horrified Donuts to withdraw from the Atlantic or face annihilation with the U-Boat flotilla now on the back foot and the surface Fleet incapable of sustained offensive operations Hitler ordered all remaining Capital ships scrapped prompting Admiral Raiders resignation and forcing Donuts as the new chief of the kriegs marina to plead with the fearer to reconsider Donuts convinced Hitler to preserve the surface Fleet but at the cost of halting all ongoing shipbuilding projects including the scheduled completion of the Graf Zeppelin the U-Boat flotilla did persist however aided by new designs with electrical drives and snorkels which enabled high-speed underwater operations safe from detection by radar but this was simply too little too late and as Ally tactics grew more into more successful both donuts and Hitler began sending the remaining surface vessels scurrying back to Port at a hint of danger which meant they were bombed two pieces at anchor instead Donuts also refused to acknowledge the dangers posed by Wireless Direction finding aircraft and Aztec equipped surface escorts leaving his U-boats underprepared to deal with opponents now fully equipped to counter their operations for all intents and purposes the kriegs marina ceased to exist as a factor in the war by 1944 when Germany's largest remaining warship the tirpitz was sunk after a career even less noteworthy than its sister ship the Bismarck in the final accounting 6.1 percent of Allied Shipping losses were inflicted by German surface Raiders 6.5 by mines 13.4 by air attack and 70 percent by U-boats the kriegs marina sank around 14.5 million tons of American British and Russian shipping killing an estimated 72 000 Sailors but by early 1944 99 of Allied ships were reaching their destinations intact although this may give the impression that the kriegs marina was useless in the second world war it's important to Remember The Impossible odds they faced ultimately men like Raider and donuts did the best they could with far fewer resources than either the vermacht or the luftwaffe donuts had hoped to amass a submarine flotilla of at least 300 U-boats by the time Germany went to war but had to make do with only a few dozen as late as spring of 1940 Raider likewise estimated he needed at least twice as many ships as he had in 1939 to pursue even a limited war with Britain and unlike the U-Boat Fleet nearly every loss was irreplaceable in many ways the kriegs marina was the most effective branch of the German military they just happened to be by far the smallest and tasked with covering a greater area than both the

of 680 000 men while the Russians called up 623 000 conscripts Napoleon's force was a varied one with units of Cavalry and over 1200 artillery pieces a significant portion of Napoleon's numbers came from Allied or vassal states with half of his Cavalry units and a third of his infantry coming from the German state of wurttemberg while the emperor himself LED French and Italian troops the French had the second advantage of a highly competent officer Corps including the legendary martial michalnay of the French Cavalry Russia was the second party in this Duel of juggernauts with the core of the tsarist army made up of peasant conscripts charged with serving for a full 25 years the average conscript was a man subjected to harsh conditions and harsher discipline but he bore the travels with a sense of national pride and purpose of particular Renown were the Cossacks step Raiders used as Cavalry by the Russians the Cossacks were given near total freedom of movement operating as a force unto themselves to sow Terror in the enemy ranks with their maneuvers the Ebbs and flows of the campaign in Russia deserve their own video but suffice to say that the armies that would meet at borodino were Shadows of their previously mentioned selves two months of running battles Retreats and skirmishes had taken their toll on both sides the French had been reduced to half of their original Force when battle was finally met 133 000 beaten and burned out men faced off against 125 000 Russians preparations for battle began on September 3rd 1812 when the Russian Commander Mikhail katusive selected borodino as the place where he would make his stand katusif was a fascinating character a polyglot placed in overall command to balance out the twin generals of the Russian defense the calculating Scottish import Michael Andreas Barkley and the passionate peyote by gration katusive chose his field well the village of borodino was 70 miles or roughly 112 kilometers from Moscow sitting along rivers and marshes nestled between the twin roads to the city the Russians laid out a defense in two wings the right wing being situated along the colocha stream and backed up by 26 field guns but cut off from the village of borodino by the stream the left wing was stretched out and vulnerable arrayed along a line of marshes and the semikovska stream along with the namesake Village of wooden houses with no defensive value on September 5th Napoleon's forces come across the Russian positions the French quickly array themselves to strike on the weaker Russian left focusing their initial efforts on a dog in position called the cheverdino redout the Cavalry opened the battle engaging with the Russian horse while French infantry marched on the radau itself the French Cavalry sent their counterparts to round as Napoleon's infantry engage in a point-blank musket duel with the Russians who hold the redoubt by their fingernails as their flanks disintegrate in a Darkly comic twist the commander of the Russian Artillery had observed the opening moments of the battle and rode off to report tuba gration how well the position was holding he now comes back to find the position crumbling his guns perilously close to capture as Russian infantry abandoned Theory doubt Nightfall brings no respite as the French continued their tug of war until the stroke of midnight when orders from katusiv come to retreat the French take the area and the Russian commanders bicker in their tents this initial engagement sees 18 000 Russians pitted against 25 000 French in a horrendous miscalculation for now an uneasy peace settles over berodino the Russians have no interest in sallying Forth while Napoleon feverishly finalizes his strategy anticipating the arrival of his reserve artillery the French Emperor is presented with plans for a grand flanking maneuver which he rejects outright opting for a frontal assault katusive meanwhile opts for a vague defensive plan Holding Out for as long as possible and refusing to commit his reserves until the last possible moment the French construct bridges over the colocha above berodino and array their guns to bombard The Village as the morning of the seventh Dawns Napoleon's officers read their men a proclamation from the emperor soldiers here is the battle you have so much desired the victory now depends on you we have need of it Victory will give us abundant supplies good winter quarters and a prompt return to our native land fight as you did at austerlitz Friedland vitepsk and Smolensk and posterity will remember with pride your conduct on this great day may it be said of each of us he fought in that great battle under the walls of Moscow the French commit 85 000 men to Napoleon's Grand assault who will throw themselves at the Russians along a 1.5 mile or roughly two kilometer front stretching from a redoubt in the north commanded by Russian general Nikolai rayevsky to fetid Marshland in the south in the far south a Polish contingent marches up the old Smolensk road to outflank the Russians at 6am precisely the French guns open up hammering on the Russian soldiers in berodino Barkley orders his men to abandon the village and burn the borodino bridge but the Russians are already engaged in 15 minutes they lose over half their numbers but succeed in burning the bridge as ordered the french plant artillery on their side of the river in response bringing the Russian's own Canon and ryevsky's Riddell quite literally under the gun a half hour later Russians under bhagratian face a French assault on their Earthworks or fleshes with Napoleon's forces marching through devastating canister shot and ambushes by Russian Jaegers as they make for the Earthworks the French are bloodied by their advance and driven off by the Russians who hold their fortifications at the same time the poles on the Smolensk Road assault the village of Utica which includes a hill with a commanding view of the battlefield the Russians fight hard to hold The High Ground burning Utica itself in their bid to deny Napoleon as the polls continue to push on the village French forces enter the nearby Woods to clear the Troublesome Jaegers both sides send reinforcements into the fights and the struggle for bakratian's fleshes is particularly Fierce A Renewed French assault outpaces Russian reinforcements and pagratian himself is injured though he successfully withdraws and survives a rumor Burns through his lines that the passionate Commander is dead critically wounding Russian morale but gratian is carried to a medical tent where he begins issuing orders at 9 30 a.m ryevsky's redoubt sees its first attack the French Advance slowly on the fortification unaware that many of its Defenders have been siphoned off to other areas the redau is a cramped Affair too small to hold any infantry so the crews of their 18 guns inside are expected to both serve their pieces and defend the parapet the Russian infantry Mass outside the walls while the Cavalry stand on to the left rear of the fortification and are severely bloodied by the French opening bombardment ryevsky observes the battle from the parapet and sees an initial French assault repulsed by his infantry but the general celebration is short-lived as the smoke from his weapons create an ad hoc smoke screen that the French use to mask a second push ryevsky ignorant of the French Advance receives word that bagration has been injured and has requested he changed positions as he takes in this new order rayapsky suddenly forced to retreat before a wave of Napoleon's grenadiers bayonets fixed and murder in their eyes the French sweep ryevsky and his men from the redoubt while the fighting rages at vibration's fleshes and ryevsky's redoubt Napoleon commands an assault on the Russians Center left with a majority Cavalry Force the French Riders blunder into the Russian lines and are at risk of being swamped by their tsarist counterparts until a Lancer unit makes a spectacular counter sending the Russian horse scattering the Russian infantry is made of Sterner stuff and forms squares that catch the seemingly ascendant French Cavalry in a withering Crossfire the Russians trip up the French so badly that their infantry are able to launch a bayonet charge against cavalry Napoleon fails to commit his reserves into the fight continually insisting he lacks sufficient intelligence to do so though it is reported the emperor is exhausted and utterly sleep deprived which may explain his bizarre decision here nevertheless the Russians stand like Stone in the face of Napoleon's attack and hold their positions for a full two hours as the battle rages Cossacks suddenly appear in a flanking maneuver on the French line Barkley rides to assume command from bugration and is stopped by the spectacle of the fight over rayevsky's redoubt smoke and Flame prevent the Scot from seeing anything and he sends a subordinate to investigate who finds the defense in collapse and the redoubt in French hands but the French are counter-attacked from four directions simultaneously and in 10 minutes their gains are entirely reversed the cossack's presence deterring a French counter-attack and buying the Russians critical time it is afternoon in berodino ryevsky's redoubt has been recaptured the polls at Utica are finally and definitively reposed and the fortunes of battle seem to be shifting against Napoleon it is now critical that the French retake ryevsky's redount and after hours delay thanks to the Cossacks and Russian Artillery Napoleon's men March once more Barkley Demers on reinforcing the position leaving whoever is defending Theory doubt to their own devices the redoubt is assaulted at 3 pm led by the French horse who fly in to engage The Defenders hand-to-hand with the French infantry close behind the Russian infantry draw themselves up on elevated ground behind the redoubt with conspicuous gaps in their line the French Cavalry leave the redoubt to engage the Russians riding straight through the gaps in their own line where they are set on by Barclays Cavalry in a bitter melee on the whole the Russians have steadily been pushed back despite winning tactical victories and the Defenders of Utica find themselves in a Salient which they pull out of in the late afternoon leaving the village to finally fall to the polls Barkley sends a staff officer to katusiv to ask for reinforcements and a chance to salvage something from this back and forth Barkley's Rider finds katusiv far off from the fighting surrounded by an Entourage of young and thoroughly debauched officers katusif is indignant at a report of Napoleon's progress declaring that the messenger was clearly a drunkard who had not seen the real battle we have victoriously repulsed the French attackers along the whole length of our front and tomorrow I shall place myself at the head of the army and drive the enemy without more Ado from the holy soil of Russia despite his outright delusional statements katusif orders Barkley to withdraw to better ground convinced that at a minimum the French have been desperately bloodied and he can Marshal a grand counter-attack the next day Barkley knows this to be a Folly and orders a general Retreat it is now 6 PM in berodino and the battle is finally over katusiv declared himself the winner of a great Victory and wrote a letter to Tsar Alexander informing him the vainglorious general received a hundred thousand rubles and promotion to field Marshal all at the cost of 38 to 44 000 dead and wounded which equates to roughly 34 of the troops committed to the fight katusif was not far off with his uninformed estimation of the French condition Napoleon's forces were bloodied with thirty thousand killed and wounded but berodino allowed to Napoleon to march on and occupy Moscow a feat which logically should have led to the czar's surrender a surrender which did not come the Grand Army emerged from berodino a husk exhausted and wretched so they wintered in Moscow before their disastrous withdrawal back to warmer climbs marching not from the scene of a great Victory but to the beginning of Napoleon's end [Music]\",\n",

the people of Latin America had\\xa0\\xa0 been frequent Pawns in the power struggles\\xa0\\nfought between Spain and Portugal both of\\xa0\\xa0 whom had poured vast amounts of time money and\\xa0\\npolitical Capital into dominating the continent\\xa0\\xa0 however freedom from the Yoke of colonial\\xa0\\nAdministration did little to foster a sense\\xa0\\xa0 of community or shared

the 1810s resulting\\xa0\\xa0 in the independence of Argentina Uruguay\\xa0\\nand Paraguay all three of these countries\\xa0\\xa0 promptly began engaging in significant border\\xa0\\ndisputes over the mostly unchartered regions\\xa0\\xa0 that lay between their population centers seeing\\xa0\\nan opportunity to project its sphere of influence\\xa0\\xa0 further south the Empire of Brazil recognized the\\xa0\\nindependence of Paraguay in 1844 placing them in\\xa0\\xa0 direct opposition to Argentina which considered\\xa0\\nParaguay a breakaway Province but this is Latin\\xa0\\xa0 America and things are never simple in Latin\\xa0\\nAmerica upon gaining their freedom the new\\xa0\\xa0 government of Paraguay had wasted no time picking\\xa0\\nthings up right where the Spanish left off by\\xa0\\xa0 restarting the decades-old argument over whether\\xa0\\nthe Oppa or brocco river should be the demarcation\\xa0\\xa0 line between their territory and that of Brazil\\xa0\\nthis meant that while Brazil was trying to use\\xa0\\xa0 Paraguay as a buffer against the argentines\\xa0\\nthe paraguayan government was belligerently\\xa0\\xa0 demanding territorial concessions and making\\xa0\\nit as hard as possible for Brazilian ships to\\xa0\\xa0 use the Paraguay River adding to this Tangled mess\\xa0\\nof conflicting interests was the situat nation in\\xa0\\xa0 Uruguay which was torn between two main political\\xa0\\nparties the Colorados and the Blancos Brazil had\\xa0\\xa0 already intervened twice in Uruguayan Affairs by\\xa0\\n1855 and in 1863 they stepped in again after the\\xa0\\xa0 Colorados rebelled against the reigning Blanco\\xa0\\nparty which was Allied to Paraguay at the time\\xa0\\xa0 thoroughly annoyed with the fractious two-party\\xa0\\nState Brazil issued an ultimatum to the blanco\\xa0\\xa0 government demanding that they protect Brazilian\\xa0\\ninterests in the region or face an invasion the\\xa0\\xa0 blanco government refused and Brazilian\\xa0\\nwarships promptly obliterated Uruguay's\\xa0\\xa0 minuscule Navy and marched across the border in\\xa0\\nOctober of 1864. the Brazilians assumed that a\\xa0\\xa0 swift resolution to the blanco situation would\\xa0\\nprevent interference from Uruguay's allies only\\xa0\\xa0 for this notion to be swiftly disproven when\\xa0\\nparaguayan Marines stormed aboard the Brazilian\\xa0\\xa0 steamer Marcus de Olinda as it approached their\\xa0\\ncapital city of asuncian on November 13th this\\xa0\\xa0 was followed swiftly by a formal declaration\\xa0\\nof war between the two Nations on December 13th\\xa0\\xa0 the belligerent attitude demonstrated by the\\xa0\\ntiny nation of Paraguay towards the gigantic\\xa0\\xa0 Empire of Brazil stemmed primarily from the\\xa0\\ngrandiose Ambitions of a single man president\\xa0\\xa0 Francisco soleno Lopez AKA The wannabe Napoleon\\xa0\\nof South America the son of Paraguay's first\\xa0\\xa0 president Lopez came to power in September\\xa0\\nof 1862 and immediately set about preparing\\xa0\\xa0 his country for war though it possessed barely\\xa0\\nhalf a million citizens compared to Brazil's\\xa0\\xa0 11 million Paraguay had invested heavily into its\\xa0\\nmilitary and cobbled together a force of about 70\\xa0\\xa0 000 men at a time when Brazil was Fielding fewer\\xa0\\nthan half that number but ragtag barely even began\\xa0\\xa0 to describe the state of Lopez's men as many of\\xa0\\nthem lacked even basic necessities like shoes\\xa0\\xa0 however this did not stop the aspirational\\xa0\\nLatin American Grand Army from scoring\\xa0\\xa0 several early victories against the empire\\xa0\\nin the opening phases of the war wounding\\xa0\\xa0 the giant as it struggled to mobilize more\\xa0\\nthan a token Force along its Southern border sadly for the eternally ambitious Lopez a\\xa0\\nquick Advance into the Brazilian province\\xa0\\xa0 of Mato Grosso meant to very little in the grand\\xa0\\nscheme of things as Uruguay was still well Out\\xa0\\xa0 Of Reach and the Brazilian Navy stood ready to\\xa0\\nintercept any attempts to transport paraguayan\\xa0\\xa0 soldiers to their allies the province of\\xa0\\ncorrientes offered a convenient land route\\xa0\\xa0 to Uruguay but it was under the control of\\xa0\\nArgentina faced with no Alternatives Lopez\\xa0\\xa0 requested permission to cross Argentine territory\\xa0\\nto relieve the beleaguered uruguayans after his\\xa0\\xa0 envoys were presumably laughed out of the room\\xa0\\na furious Lopez decided to drag Argentina into\\xa0\\xa0 the war by crossing the corrientes with\\xa0\\ntwenty thousand Men by April Lopez had\\xa0\\xa0 captured the provincial capital seizing many\\xa0\\nArgentine warships as they lay at anchor import however the rash actions of Paraguay's eccentric\\xa0\\ndictator would have dire consequences as after\\xa0\\xa0 Decades of jockeying for position the two largest\\xa0\\nLatin American nations now had a common cause\\xa0\\xa0 and diplomats from Argentina soon met with those\\xa0\\nfrom the Empire of Brazil to hammer out a formal\\xa0\\xa0 alliance against Paraguay while negotiations were\\xa0\\nongoing Brazilian armies were busy mopping up\\xa0\\xa0 resistance in Uruguay with Lopez now far too busy\\xa0\\nlooting pillaging and murdering his way through\\xa0\\xa0 corrientes to care about little things like aiding\\xa0\\nhis allies the Blanco's stood no chance against\\xa0\\xa0 the Brazilian Army of the South on the 2nd of\\xa0\\nFebruary Monty video the capital of Uruguay was\\xa0\\xa0 under siege surrendering on the 20th by May the\\xa0\\nColorados had taken over and concluded a formal\\xa0\\xa0 military pact with Brazil and Argentina creating a\\xa0\\nTriple Alliance that could now Focus its attention\\xa0\\xa0 on Paraguay just like his hero Napoleon Bonaparte\\xa0\\nFrancisco Lopez had successfully managed to unite\\xa0\\xa0 his opposition into a coalition with the express\\xa0\\npurpose of crushing his Imperial Ambitions forever\\xa0\\xa0 in yet another comparison to the Napoleonic\\xa0\\nWars Brazilian Naval dominance allowed them\\xa0\\xa0 to isolate Paraguay's economy by blockading\\xa0\\nthe Rio de La Plata this sparked the battle\\xa0\\xa0 of the riachuelo the largest naval\\xa0\\nengagement in South American history\\xa0\\xa0 when Lopez ordered the paraguayan Navy to launch\\xa0\\nfrom The Fortress of umaita and ambushed the\\xa0\\xa0 blockade on the 11th of June 1865. Lopez had\\xa0\\ngiven strict orders to his Admiral Pedro Ignacio\\xa0\\xa0 Mesa to conduct a surprise attack and boarding\\xa0\\noperation to capture the enemy Fleet while it lay\\xa0\\xa0 mostly at anchor but Mesa ignored these orders and\\xa0\\ninstead opened fire as soon as he was within range\\xa0\\xa0 this initial barrage inflicted some damage on the\\xa0\\nBrazilian Fleet but it also alerted the shorebound\\xa0\\xa0 crews who scrambled back aboard their ships and\\xa0\\nlaunched a counter-attack thick fog made gunfire\\xa0\\xa0 on both sides highly inaccurate but for a time it\\xa0\\nseemed as if the paraguayans had the upper hand\\xa0\\xa0 however the tide of battle turned abruptly when\\xa0\\nBrazilian Admiral Francisco Manuel barholzo\\xa0\\xa0 charged mesa's line smashing several of these\\xa0\\nsmaller enemy warships and barges beneath the\\xa0\\xa0 prow of his paddle steamer at around the same\\xa0\\ntime Admiral Mesa was hit in the chest forcing\\xa0\\xa0 his Fleet to make a disorderly withdrawal under\\xa0\\nheavy fire are wholeso's quick thinking would\\xa0\\xa0 earn him the title Baron of the amazonas while\\xa0\\nmesses insubordination would have earned him a\\xa0\\xa0 firing squad had not the injuries he sustained\\xa0\\nin battle proved fatal only eight days later\\xa0\\xa0 the defeat at the Battle of riachuelo marked\\xa0\\na permanent turning point in the fortunes of\\xa0\\xa0 the upstart paraguayans and their eccentric\\xa0\\ndictator with Uruguay now part of the Triple\\xa0\\xa0 Alliance Lopez now ordered his army to invade\\xa0\\nthe country through corientes in the hopes of\\xa0\\xa0 quickly toppling the Colorado's regime but\\xa0\\nhis advancing columns were turned back as\\xa0\\xa0 they tried to cross the Uruguayan River\\xa0\\nat the Battle of jutai a force of only 3\\xa0\\xa0 000 paraguayans faced off against a combined Army\\xa0\\nof at least nine thousand enemy troops despite\\xa0\\xa0 being heavily outnumbered the paraguayan Cavalry\\xa0\\ninflicted heavy losses on the enemy infantry\\xa0\\xa0 but the entire force was eventually killed or\\xa0\\ncaptured with increasing numbers of Allied troops\\xa0\\xa0 advancing into the corrientes Lopez withdrew\\xa0\\nback into Paraguay to prepare for an invasion although the Triple Alliance had now driven Lopez\\xa0\\nout of the corrientes they had underestimated how\\xa0\\xa0 costly the war would be Latin America had\\xa0\\nlittle in the way of industry or military\\xa0\\xa0 infrastructure and while the paraguayan soldiers\\xa0\\nwere ill-equipped they were still highly motivated\\xa0\\xa0 by a charismatic leader the Triple Alliance\\xa0\\nmeanwhile were forced to fill out their ranks\\xa0\\xa0 with slaves and Backwater provincials after months\\xa0\\nof ponderous preparation the alliance dragged a\\xa0\\xa0 force of over 35 000 dispirited disease-riddled\\xa0\\nand under-supplied conscripts over the border and\\xa0\\xa0 set up camp in the marshy lowland terrain of tut\\xa0\\nthe choice of campsite proved inspired when a 27\\xa0\\xa0 000 strong paraguayan Army was caught\\xa0\\ntrying to creep up on the Defenders\\xa0\\xa0 through the thick scrub land prompting\\xa0\\nthe largest Battle of the war foreign the paraguayans charged the Defenders\\xa0\\nhead-on causing massive casualties on\\xa0\\xa0 both sides the poor terrain delayed the main\\xa0\\nAdvance resulting in attacks coming in waves\\xa0\\xa0 rather than the planned single huge assault\\xa0\\nthroughout the day paraguayan Cavalry caused\\xa0\\xa0 Havoc all along the Allied line only being driven\\xa0\\nback by artillery fire and infantry squares by\\xa0\\xa0 the time the fighting seized the Allied Force had\\xa0\\ntaken 3 000 casualties in exchange for nearly 13\\xa0\\xa0 000 paraguayan losses this was an enormous\\xa0\\nblow to Lopez's Ambitions forcing him to\\xa0\\xa0 refill his depleted ranks with the elderly and\\xa0\\nunderaged but on the other hand the Allied Army\\xa0\\xa0 had come very close to Breaking during the Frantic\\xa0\\nengagement and needed time to rest and reorganize\\xa0\\xa0 while they waited disease broke out in the\\xa0\\ncamp striking down men by the thousands with\\xa0\\xa0 reinforcements trickling in at a snail's pace\\xa0\\nthe advance into Paraguay stalled devolving\\xa0\\xa0 into primitive trench warfare both sides at\\xa0\\na temporary impasse Lopez reached out to the\\xa0\\xa0 Argentine president bartolome Mitre and attempted\\xa0\\nto negotiate a peace treaty but mitrae insisted\\xa0\\xa0 Lopez surrendered unconditionally which only\\xa0\\nencouraged Lopez to resist to The Bitter End\\xa0\\xa0 following the negotiations the Invaders attempted\\xa0\\nto break through the Fortified lines around\\xa0\\xa0 kurupaiti in September assuming Naval bombardment\\xa0\\nwould paralyze The Defenders the overconfident\\xa0\\xa0 attackers became trapped in muddy terrain and\\xa0\\nslaughtered by hidden artillery positions nearly 4\\xa0\\xa0 000 Allied troops died in the foolhardy attack\\xa0\\nmaking kurupaiti their worst defeat of the war\\xa0\\xa0 sadly for the defiant Lopez success at korapai tea\\xa0\\nonly amounted to a temporary stay of execution by\\xa0\\xa0 now the Triple Alliance had agreed on appointing\\xa0\\nthe Duke of kashias to command The Invasion and\\xa0\\xa0 this veteran officer quickly began reforming\\xa0\\nthe dispirited Army into a force capable of\\xa0\\xa0 assaulting Paraguay's ultimate defensive Bastion\\xa0\\nthe gigantic Fortress of humaita sitting a stride\\xa0\\xa0 to the River from which the country Drew its\\xa0\\nname humaita blocked all access to Asuncion\\xa0\\xa0 and even prevented the Brazilians from retaking\\xa0\\ntheir paraguayan occupied territory of matogroso\\xa0\\xa0 well aware of the enormous task that lay ahead the\\xa0\\nIron Duke chose to spend nearly eight whole months\\xa0\\xa0 training his men improving Camp sanitation\\xa0\\nand refitting his artillery core when he was\\xa0\\xa0 ready kashias swept North from toyuti and began\\xa0\\nthe painstaking process of surrounding kumita\\xa0\\xa0 a series of assaults were launched on the\\xa0\\nFortress throughout August but were met\\xa0\\xa0 with failure while a massive chain across\\xa0\\nthe river prevented the Brazilian Navy from\\xa0\\xa0 isolating humaita completely it took kashias\\xa0\\nuntil November to isolate the Bastion by land\\xa0\\xa0 but it was not until February of 1868 that a\\xa0\\ndaring rush through heavy fire allowed the Navy\\xa0\\xa0 to take control of the whole river kashias then\\xa0\\nordered his ironclads to proceed upstream and\\xa0\\xa0 bombard the capital of Asuncion while his\\xa0\\narmy continued to besieging its objective\\xa0\\xa0 realizing their position had been rendered\\xa0\\nstrategically worthless whomitas Defenders staged\\xa0\\xa0 a series of breakouts in July surrendering the\\xa0\\nposition at a final cost of around 1500 casualties\\xa0\\xa0 sitting aside the River from which the country\\xa0\\nDrew its name humaitab locked all access to the\\xa0\\xa0 asuncian having broken down the gates of Paraguay\\xa0\\nkashias continued to live up to his reputation By\\xa0\\xa0 ignoring the impressive secondary defensive line\\xa0\\nLopez had constructed along the peaky CD tributary\\xa0\\xa0 and instead cutting a 10.7 kilometer or 6.6 mile\\xa0\\nlong road through the supposedly impenetrable\\xa0\\xa0 jungle Against All Odds the Allied Army was able\\xa0\\nto conceal this operation until December then\\xa0\\xa0 burst out Behind Enemy Lines and decimated the\\xa0\\nparaguayans in a series of hard-fought engagements\\xa0\\xa0 known collectively as the de zambrada this\\xa0\\nculminated in a battle of Lomas valentinas where\\xa0\\xa0 Cassius and Lopez went head-to-head in a lopsided\\xa0\\nengagement that nearly resulted in the paraguayan\\xa0\\xa0 dictator being captured alongside his senior\\xa0\\nstaff officers only a desperate rush through\\xa0\\xa0 the Enemy Lines at the height of the battle by his\\xa0\\nCavalry Corps saved Lopez from an ignominious fate\\xa0\\xa0 and he vanished into the jungle alongside the\\xa0\\ntattered remnants of Paraguay's army with no\\xa0\\xa0 enemies left to oppose him on the battlefield\\xa0\\nthe Victorious Iron Duke of Brazil moved to\\xa0\\xa0 occupy asuncian which was mostly abandoned having\\xa0\\nspent years on campaign cashias was exhausted and\\xa0\\xa0 would soon return home as one of Latin America's\\xa0\\ngreatest military Heroes meanwhile a force of 30\\xa0\\xa0 000 Allied soldiers began looting and burning\\xa0\\nthe paraguayan capital reducing it to ruins\\xa0\\xa0 the Fortress of humaita was also raised to the\\xa0\\nground and over the next few months the Triple\\xa0\\xa0 Alliance would work systematically to obliterate\\xa0\\nparagwise infrastructure Lopez responded with\\xa0\\xa0 an increasingly brutal campaign of Guerrilla\\xa0\\nwarfare that saw paraguayan troops burning their\\xa0\\xa0 own settlements in a scorched Earth campaign\\xa0\\nand shooting potential deserters on the spot\\xa0\\xa0 this Insurgency would continue until the Battle\\xa0\\nof seikura on the 1st of March 1870 when 4\\xa0\\xa0 000 Brazilian soldiers located and hunted\\xa0\\ndown Lopez's personal guard of 400.\\xa0\\xa0 defiant to the last Lopez refused to surrender and\\xa0\\nwas stabbed by a Brazilian cavalryman despite the\\xa0\\xa0 Mortal injury the former dictator kept fighting\\xa0\\nuntil he collapsed next to a riverbank when\\xa0\\xa0 again offered clemency Lopez replied by shouting\\xa0\\nPatria or I die with my nation and was shot dead the ignominious death of Francisco Solano Lopez\\xa0\\nmarked the official end of the war of the Triple\\xa0\\xa0 Alliance Latin America's bloodiest conflict Brazil\\xa0\\nwould continue to occupy Paraguay until 1876\\xa0\\xa0 forcing the nation to relinquish all of its claims\\xa0\\nto Allied territory and Seed over 150 000 square\\xa0\\xa0 kilometers of territory to Brazil and Argentina\\xa0\\nthe conflict utterly devastated Paraguay to the\\xa0\\xa0 point that its population dropped over 60 percent\\xa0\\nwith a death toll of at least three hundred\\xa0\\xa0 thousand the

       " \" hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian during the final months of the first world war a series of allied offensives finally broke the bloody stalemate on the western front civil unrest in germany surged while its demoralized and exhausted armies were sent into a headlong retreat kaiser wilhelm ii was forced to abdicate in the face of imminent revolution and on november 11 1918 the new german republic signed a humiliating armistice which saw much of its former territory partitioned by the victorious nations various circumstances had influenced the empire's collapse but it was the unrelenting pressure from the massive allied offensives that had proven most fatal today we are taking a closer look at what is known as the hundred days offensive the offensive that ended

started with a series of political earthquakes in germany the united states had entered the war one year prior on the side of the allies and a german defeat seemed inevitable on the home front thousands of war-weary starving german citizens took to the streets to protest the once glorious conflict that now seemed little more than a meat grinder supplied by the nation's youth but right when all seemed lost miraculous news arrived from the eastern front the nascent soviet union had signed a peace treaty with germany officially ending its participation in the war the commander of the german army general eric ludendorff suddenly sensed an opportunity to end the war before morale broke down and american troops in europe could arrive in force having freed up his forces on the eastern front he quickly seized the opportunity to prepare a massive spring offensive against the western allies the plan for operation michael was to deliver a knockout blow to the british expeditionary force in the ross sector driving the tommy's back to the english channel ludendorff assured the german people that final victory was now once again finally imminent on march 21st an elite vanguard of specially trained german stormtroopers advanced across no man's land and found themselves aided by a thick layer of fog as they infiltrated deep into the british lines the stunned british were put on the back foot as german morale sword but the offensive gradually petered out in the face of logistical issues tactical mistakes and the timely arrival of french reinforcements unwilling to concede an agitated ludendorff doubled down and launched a series of increasingly costly and incoherent follow-up offensives which although they saw tactical successes ultimately failed to achieve operational breakthroughs when the dust had finally settled on july 18th the exhausted and stretched out germans had suffered some 700 000 casualties while the allies had to contend with a combined loss of nearly 865 000 men of their own although a numeric victory the depleted german empire could ill afford to replace their losses while the allies could count on 250 000 fresh american troops arriving on the continent each month to make matters worse the onset of the spanish influenza hit the german lines hard with over 1 million soldiers falling ill between may and july alone and when on july 20th french units under general ferdinand fox forced the battered germans to retreat from the river marn the stage seemed set for the allies to pull an uno reverse card and embark on an offensive of their own gathered at the town of bonbon the allied commanders agreed to a series of limited attacks across the front the amya salient was to be the site of the first push as the open and hard terrain there was considered to be especially favorable for tank maneuvers and the german forces in the area were considered to be only lightly entrenched and suffering from poor morale the veteran canadian and australian corps were tapped to shoulder the main weight of the offensive in contrast to their german opponents they were well rested highly motivated and equipped with some 500 tanks including the new mark v in addition the attack would be supported by a well-prepared mass of artillery and would enjoy clear air superiority to maintain the element of surprise the appearance was given that the canadians would strike in flanders instead as a result german intelligence had little notion of what was to come on august 8th at 4 20 am 2 000 allied guns rudely woke the germans with a devastating bombardment that silenced the majority of german artillery pieces so stunned were the defenders by the shelling that the canadians and australians were upon them before they had a chance to recover to the south the french first army saw similar success and made rapid gains in the meantime german general georg van der marwitz frantically tried to figure out what was going on as his reserve forces struggled to get past the remnants of the shattered front-line divisions however by the end of the day the allied forces had reached their objectives and had advanced close to 8 miles or almost 13 kilometers into enemy territory according to von der marvitz the aggressive use of tanks which he called evil weapons had been the major factor in the decimation of the defending german second army moreover their rapid advance into the enemy's rear left the neighboring 18th army's flank positionally unhinged and served as an indicator for the way tanks would be utilized in the next war german losses that day were so high that the 8th of august would become known as the black day after having lost a staggering 48 000 men on top of 400 guns and hundreds of machine guns and trench mortars fueled by this unprecedented success the allies widened the attack on the northern and southern shoulder although the british and french armies managed to push on for several more miles the following day the advance was slowed due to the fact that the supporting artillery simply could not keep pace with the infantry and many tanks were beginning to suffer mechanical failures the australians in the meantime were pinned down at the village of hamel by german artillery fire coming from the shipya ridge the shelling from the heights would continue until the end of the day when a daring assault by elements of the 33rd u.s infantry silenced the guns however by the end of august 10th the advance had ground to a final halt as arriving german reinforcements managed to stabilize the situation and allied supply lines were stretched thin nevertheless the offensive had been a major success as the town of monte die which had been the offensive's main objective had been encircled by the french and all the territory that the germans had gained during operation michael had been retaken in a matter of days at the german supreme army command or the ohl the mood had turned sour the previously triumphant ludendorff now advised the kaiser that germany ought to seek a negotiated peace the german army would however need to hold its present ground on french soil in order to obtain favorable terms in an urgent meeting with reich chancellor georg von hertling and the kaiser the leaders of the ohl general ludendorff and field marshal paul von hindenburg insisted that the army would be able to do so provided the german people continued to support them on the other side of no man's land general fock had gotten an appetite for victory and urged the allied commanders to press the attack into the sam region his colleagues however cautioned against this idea as intelligence had indicated that the german positions in the area had now been significantly reinforced unwilling to consider alternative plans the unyielding frenchman ultimately got his way and on the 21st of august the british third army under general sir julian bing advanced through a thick layer of fog into the battle-scarred territory that had haunted the tommy's two years prior although initially aided by the lack of visibility the attack gradually slowed down as entire waves of men lost their way in the mist as expected german resistance was stiff and losses were high especially among the tanks and the advance was finally stopped dead in its tracks in the face of relentless artillery fire nonetheless the british advanced three miles or nearly five kilometers in one day and managed to secure several of their objectives in the process in the following days a renewed push saw the further capture of albert and bao pama and carried the australian corps to the banks of the soam river which they reached on august 31st after having found a lone rail head among the destroyed bridges and railways on the river the mast aussies queued up to continue their unparalleled advance and by september 4th the men from a land down under had smashed the german defensive line at the battles of montson county and peyron with the germans now in a headlong retreat from the somme the allied armies were in position to attack the famed hindenburg line the final german defensive position on the western front the following month brought more bad news for the kaiser as his retreating armies were caught with their pants down on several occasions at saw miaow the american first army with support from the elite french second colonial corps completely overwhelmed the withdrawing germans news arriving from germany's allies was equally catastrophic the austro-hungarians had started sending peace proposals to the united states and the bulgarians were similarly pleading for a ceasefire in the face of imminent military collapse on the solenica front faced with a whopping 460 000 casualties in the months of august and september alone ludendorff was noted to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown on the front line the mood had soured too peering towards no man's land demoralized german soldiers now awaited inescapable defeat or death the anticipated allied assault on the hindenburg line came in the final week of september on the 26th a combined franco-american force advanced up the thickly wooded hillsides of the argol forest although conscious of the difficult terrain and intricate defenses in front of his men us general john jay pershing intended to force his way through the 61 000 defenders with his numerically overwhelming assault force of 330 000 although seeing some initial success the advance of the inexperienced americans ground down to a crawl in the face of tenacious resistance and the arrival of significant german reinforcements and the fighting in the forest would continue right up until the end of the war to the north america's allies had more success with the canadian corps capturing the canal du nord on the 27th and general fox launching an assault on the song contact canal two days later the canal formed a formidable obstacle at 35 feet or nearly 11 meters wide littered with barbed wire after shelling the area for several days with thousands of guns a joint american australian and british force crept forward to cover the advance allied artillery fired some 30 000 rounds of mustard gas toward the german defenders whose understrength divisions had by that time been reduced to the size of regiments still the attackers struggled immensely until the british ninth corps to the south managed to cross the canal and capture the recaval bridge the feared hindenburg line had been broken and the allies now possessed a crucial supply line to advance even further into german-held territory the intensity of the attacks in the south forced the germans to pivot crucial forces away from other sectors of the front this opened up lucrative opportunities for the opposing allied armies to advance in places that had been at a standstill for years at the eep salient which had been the site of four major battles in the years prior the combined british belgian force broke out on the 28th of september and overran the lightly held german lines in a single day netting another 10 000 prisoners further south at cambray the british also sensed opportunity and pressed the attack the withdrawn german defenders attempted to buy time by booby-trapping the area even setting fire to the town itself but they too were quickly overrun with the hindenburg line decisively broken and the imperial army in disarray ludendorff realized that the war was now inevitably lost in the north belgian french and british forces in the eep sector further exploited their breakthrough by pushing deeper into flanders they were met with little resistance from the exhausted and demoralized germans and by mid-october the british fourth army had crossed the river cell with ease meanwhile the situation on the german home front began to move in tandem with the rapid breakdown on the front in early october the newly appointed chancellor of germany maximilian von baden initiated negotiations with the american government of president woodrow wilson to request an immediate ceasefire but when the german government conceded to demands for political reforms and unconditional surrender the ohl lashed out by flat out rejecting any of the humiliating terms proposed by the wilson government and instead ordered its troops to fight on until the bloody end to break the deadlock baden convinced the kaiser to dismiss ludendorff from the ohl on october 26th a day later the german government accepted wilson's conditions for an armistice however the wheels of revolution were already turning and these developments did but little to temper the growing civil unrest on the very day the conditions were accepted a mutiny broke out in wilhelmshofen when hundreds of sailors refused to weigh anchor for one final suicide clash with the royal navy within a week their ranks grew to some 40 000 heavily armed men who now occupied much of the city's civil and military institutions and were demanding the abdication of the kaiser as well as radical political reforms with the authorities unwilling and incapable of stopping them revolutionary unrest spread like wildfire into the interior even reaching as far as the southern kingdom of bavaria on november 8th its war reary population ousted its king ludwig iii and declared itself a folkstat were the people state of bavaria on that same day panicked government officials in berlin could see with their own bulging eyes that the situation was in danger of completely spiraling out of control baden urged the kaiser to abdicate immediately to preempt a revolutionary triumph the latter consented to giving up his title as king of germany and set out to prepare an official declaration the impatient and unsatisfied chancellor decided to take matters into his own hands taking the stage to not only announce the abdication of the kaiser as both the king of germany but also the king of prussia as well as the crown prince's renunciation of rights to both titles with the kaiser gone the conditions for signing the armistice were finally met however the german delegation was in no position to demand any significant amendments in its final terms which among other things demanded hefty reparations to the allies and the seeding of much of the former empire's territory despite this the new german government instructed them to sign the armistice regardless and on november 11th at 5 a.m an agreement was reached exactly six hours later the guns that had ceaselessly roared for over four years finally fell silent and the bloody war that had cost the lives of millions had come to a sudden end although various factors played a role in the fall of the german empire it was the unrelenting pressure of the allied hundred days offensive which ultimately broke the eagle's back with ludendorff's promise of imminent victory bombarded to a crisp the exhausted german people had finally had enough the end of the first world war however did not immediately bring peace to the german homeland from his new home in the netherlands the former kaiser helplessly watched as his empire descended into a bitter revolution which would not finally end until august of the following year with the ratification of the weimar constitution the new government however would prove equally ill-equipped to deal with the many social and political hardships that lay ahead and its disgruntled population would soon look to a more radical alternative to put their humiliated nation back on the top thanks

axis occupation and the collapse of the Greek government the most powerful political force was the Communist Greek party or Kappa Kappa Epsilon which came under the leadership of georgius ciados following the imprisonment of its previous head Nicos zachariadis in Dachau the National Liberation Front or ayam was founded under Kappa Kappa Epsilon Direction in September of 1941 creating the Greek people's Liberation Army or elas the following December the combined Aya malas would begin operations in Spring of 1942 demanding its members do something completely foreign to the individualistic Greeks who were long suspicious of organized Authority thanks to centuries of foreign misrule the ayamalas demanded total and unquestioning obedience their promotion of unity and purpose the May main driver for their prominence in the underground movement but prominence did not mean cohesion and the ayam elas would find itself in conflict with not only the axis occupiers but other resistance movements as they jockeyed for political dominance in the coming liberation the Greeks did not fight alone however their defeat of Italy's Invasion brought them much support from Britain who until that point was largely fighting alone against the axis British troops were sent to the Mediterranean in March of 1941. close Behind These Boots on the ground were spies in the shadows agents of MI6 made contact with Greek partisans mi6's activities were soon absorbed into the wider Special Operations executive or soe the league of gentleman spies that included the late Sir Christopher Lee among others but with the intervention of the Nazis and the expulsion of the allies and the Greek government the soe's role in Greece would intensify with a campaign of sabotage by both British and Greek elements under soe Direction these efforts were impeded by the Greek resistance itself whose ideological infighting cast the soe as the unwilling referee in their internal conflict outside this struggle however the Greeks proved Keen intelligence gatherers and together the British and Greeks were able to send substantial reports on the growing unrest in the Greek population and the unpopularity of both the Allied approved free Greek government in Cairo and the axis puppet regime as the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 Drew near the soe went to ground focusing on arming and training their testy charges and scaling back operations with Germany on the ropes in 1944 an Allied Victory seemed more imminent by the day the ayam elas had only grown in power and influence throughout the occupation drawing worried glances from their British comrades behind closed doors the British agreed to not allow Greece to fall into the hands of the Reds and with the placa agreement of February 1944 the British finally brokered a ceasefire among the squabbling creek resistance organizations the ayam elas requested that a provisional committee be formed two liaise with the free Greek government and that a single Greek underground Army be formed assumedly by them both requests were firmly rejected things were little better for the british-backed Greeks exile to Cairo Winston Churchill had long put his weight behind the Greek monarchist faction which quickly found itself in turmoil when their chosen ruler king georgyus II refused to allow a Regency government to be installed in his name when the country was retaken the free Greek cabinet insisted on a Regency but with Churchill's backing giorgios dug his heels in the ayamalas looked on this chaos with Hungry Eyes the Reds smelled blood in the water as the Brit's chosen leader frustrated his own Camp the following month the ayam inaugurated Civil War attacking the national and social Liberation party and killing their leader this act was condemned by the newly installed Greek Prime Minister in Exile georgius papandreu who accused the Greek Communists of trying to kill their way to a one-party State not long after the Soviet delegation met with their ideological Brethren and in a surprise move georgius siados joined the papandreu government this was in line with how papandreu had opened his Premiership with a call for National unity and he set about bringing members of all the resistance groups together to form a United Greek government though papandreu's messaging stressed unity and cooperation for all Greeks it was clear his words were directed squarely at the ayam alas May of 1944 would see the disparate resistance groups and government in Exile come together and create the Lebanon Charter ratified on the 20th of that month the patchwork Greek organizations agreed to create a new Unified Government with all their interests represented to hold and honor the results of a parliamentary election and to hold a referendum on whether to bring back King georgius II back to Greece as a monarch all this papandreu hoped to accomplish with British military backing the British were in a prime position to control Greek Liberation not only did they have the soe advising and participating in the underground but resistance groups from all ends of the political Spectrum were supplied with British arms and the free Greek government was in British Egypt in summer 1944 the modestly named Operation Mana was laid out by Winston Churchill the blueprint for a British liberation of Greece meanwhile the ayam elas went on a new offensive meeting both axis soldiers and the quizling security battalions in pitched battles the aom ls were particularly vicious in the peloponnese where they hunted accused collaborators in the tune of 1 800 alleged killings the British altered operation Mana in response splitting their forces to send an element to establish order in the Peloponnesian Killing Grounds the ayam continued to keep everyone on their toes by signing new agreements with papandreu to allow operation Mana to proceed the sudden shift from violence to diplomacy confused many Greek communist fighters on the ground but the Communist leaders were more pragmatic shaking hands with papandreu while keeping a weather eye on the shoreline that same Shoreline filled with British Commandos and their Greek allies on September 25th when a combined Force captured the port of patras access control of Greece was not long for the world and the Nazis went into a full Retreat on October 12th the main British Force dropped anchor off the Greek Coast the very next day and the 23rd armored Brigade of the British army drove into Athens October 14th papandreu arrived in the Greek capital on the 18th and was immediately faced with a challenge the ayam elas controlled most of the country though not the capital of Athens and the left wing of his Patchwork Coalition howled for the punishment of collaborators add to this the total collapse of the Greek economy and the pressing need to disarm the partisans so the new government could assert control and papandreu was less the Bold leader of a liberated nation and more the latest Steward of a lit Powder Keg he turned to the British to blow out the fuse papandreu and the ayam aligned ministers in his cabinet entered Marathon talks papandreu hoping to peacefully disarm a massive network of politically driven partisans who had enjoyed great success in resisting and driving out the axis negotiations stalled out on December 2nd 1944 and the ayam contingent resigned from the government on mass the very next day crowds appeared in Athens to show support for the ayam and were fired on by police who had forbidden the Gathering in advance 33 people were killed and within an hour of the violence the secretary of the Greek Communist Party declared henceforth papandreo is an outlaw Greece had re-inaugurated their Civil War it was time for the British to involve themselves the 23rd armored was combined with the second parachute Brigade to form Ark force and defend Athens a full-scale offensive against the ayam elas was ordered a matter of life and death per Churchill the intervention was not popular with the war weary British and the Prime Minister had to defend Arc Force against a scathing political attack on the floor of the commons Churchill remained determined to crush communism in Greece in the face of any objection and December 16th would see the ayam elas launch a three-pronged attack in Athens an attack weakened by the defection of socialist elements of the movement who balked at fighting the Allies the attack would accomplish little the Communists did take territory in the south of the city territory the British cleared by the end of the month and it was here that Arc Force stopped even Churchill knew the futility of trying to beat the Communists in a brush war in the Greek Countryside the British were well and truly calling the tune of the Greek Civil War by this time and it was Churchill not papandreu who called a meeting of the aeom and the Greek government for Christmas day 1944. there was quick consensus that the Greek monarchy be restored under a regent Archbishop Damascus of the Orthodox Church the Communists demanded between 40 to 50 percent of the peacetime Parliament as well as control of the justice and interior Ministries they also clamored again for punishment of all collaborators these demands short-circuited the conference but the Communists did not pick their arms back up immediately Churchill finally browbeaten did some brow beating of his own to convince King georgius II to accept a Regency government Archbishop demasquinos was installed on December 30th and accepted papandreu's resignation appointing Hardline anti-communist General Nicolaus plasteras to head the government the Communists faced with the growing British military presence decided that the time for fighting was done the ayam elos retreated from their holdouts in Athens and the City of preyos but not before executing masses of alleged collaborators and taking up to 35 000 civilians with them as human Shields four thousand would not live to see their homes again the Communists and their captives slunk away the twin atrocities of massacring supposed enemies and kidnapping hostages planting a seed of anti-communist hatred in The Wider Greek public a seed that would Bloom and be plucked by Future authoritarian regimes in Greece but it wasn't long before anti-communists began carrying out crimes against the real and imagined ayam alas members including extrajudicial killings and disappearances intense surveillance banishments to deserted islands and the kidnapping and indoctrination of children the last crime won that both sides shared a hand in Ark Force stood down on January 8 1945 and a legation from the ayam arrived to negotiate a truce with the British two days later on January 15th the ayam signed a formal Armistice with the British and all military operations seized the tired tommies began packing up to go fight somewhere else leaving the Greek Communists to meet their countrymen and Hammer out some kind of solution the resulting varkisa agreement on February 12 saw the ayam alas commit to demobilization and British supervised disarmament while the plastereros government pledged elections within a year with a tentative peace finally in place plus tiras could turn his attention to repairing the ruined Greek economy and curtailing his right-wing fellows desire for retaliation against the Communists who had led the resistance for so long plus tiras would eventually resign after a newspaper published a letter he had sent to the Nazis in an attempt to convince the Reich to broker a piece between Greece and fascist Italy Admiral Petros vulgaris would succeed plus tiras and was forced to reckon with the appearance of Vigilantes armed with weapons seized from The ayam elas Who sought their own retribution against the Communists and who remained the very real power in many areas of the country British soldiers would begin leaving Greece in large numbers the following April beginning a years-long withdrawal that would officially end in 1950. this drawdown coincided with a year of mounting tensions not only as the Greek Vigilantes who dubbed themselves the National Guard postured and sought to satisfy their vendettas but as the Greek Communists began to regain some of their previous Zeal abandoning any Notions of reconciliation and calling for a Greek soviet-style state this was bolstered by the release of Nicos zakariadis the Communists previous leader from Dachau zakariadis resumed his former position and it was under his watch that the third phase of the Greek Civil War would begin on March 30 1946 a band of ex-am alas partisans attacked the police station in the village of litocuro at the base of Mount Olympus full-scale Guerrilla War ensued and the British watched Greece turn red Yugoslavia would Supply the Greek Communists with everything from Small Arms to land mines to anti-aircraft weapons but even as the British threw their hands up and left the security of the nation to the fledging Greek army in 1947 the Reds sorely lacked food and other basic necessities it was here that Greece would receive a helping hand the United States eager not to let Communism spread in the post-war World sent the Greek government advisors and equipment that gave the Greek army a decisive advantage the Communists were placed on the back foot and the Greek government pushed them back culminating in a final battle on the Albanian border the final communist redoubt in the gramos mountain range fell after intense fighting in 1949 the defeated Communists fleeing over the frontier the Greek government declared Victory officially ending the Greek Civil War [Music] Britain and later the United States intervened to ensure that the Communists would not gain control of the nation but what ensued was a period of division and ruin while political schisms tore the Greek people apart British military intervention imperialist as it was helped to liberate Greece from the axis and lended some stability but in the end conflict was inevitable Greece would ultimately prove to be yet another stage upon which the cold War's ideological drama was performed and though Britain and the United States would prevent the Cradle of democracy from slipping behind the Iron Curtain their intervention set the stage for the future installation of a right-wing military Junta 20 years on [Music] thank you [Music]\",\n",
       " \" hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian it can sometimes be easy to forget the truly global nature of the cold war from norway to argentina not a single political entity escaped the attention of these superpowers as they struggled for dominance between 1945 and 1991. an often overlooked theater of the cold war is the continent of africa whose fate hung in the balance after over a century of european dominance in this video we'll focus on the impact of u.s and soviet political economic and military interventions in africa and how they affected the process of decolonization we'll also see how the europeans reacted to the various nationalist and socialist movements that emerged during this period and how the stubbornness of some colonial powers resulted in some of the

africa after six years of conflict the british empire was an exhausted shadow of its former self while the french republic was left in deep political and social turmoil after the nazi occupation with the great colonial powers now at their weakest the africans quickly realized the importance of carrying favor with the united states and the soviet union whose influence could easily determine the success or failure of any independence movement though neither of these superpowers had a direct say in african affairs they could exert considerable influence via the united nations which they had jointly founded alongside 50 other member states in june of 1945. the first major example of un interference in africa occurred when the fate of the former colonies of the defeated italian empire was called into question italian territories in libya somaliland eritrea ethiopia and the rest of east africa had been placed under allied military administration after the end of the war and many expected that at least some of these lands would be divided up between britain and france in the coming years but in 1949 the un general assembly endorsed libyan independence resulting in the creation of the united kingdom of libya two years later the british had recognized the full sovereignty of ethiopia in 1944 and emperor hale selassie returned to power once the italians were driven out of the country eritrea would then become part of the ethiopian empire in 1952 while somaliland and east africa were put under their own paths to self-governance by un oversight committees unfortunately a majority of these mergers or integrations would merely set the stage for the divided poverty stricken africa that trudged into the 21st century while the u.n was quietly limbering up in preparation for full-scale decolonization france was busy providing a case study on how not to hold on to colonial territories after becoming completely bogged down in the first indochina war with vietnam the republic then received another massive blow from an explosive rebellion in 1952 in algeria one of france's oldest colonial territories the rebels were known as the national liberation front whose leaders were highly active in the international community denouncing french treatment of the native muslim population and selectively courting the favor of both the soviet union and the united states for their own ends the uprising coincided with unrest in the french holdings of tunisia and morocco forcing the republic to grant both independence in 1956 so that resources could be diverted to algeria throughout the seven year conflict both sides committed blatant atrocities murdering civilians assassinating prominent officials and making liberal use of torture by 1958 most of the international community had turned against the french administration and in an effort to hold on to the jewel of their colonial empire the military orchestrated what amounted to a coup by demanding charles de gaulle become the next french president with little bargaining power the french parliament agreed and de gaulle immediately set about solidifying his hold on algeria by holding a referendum on algerian independence completely distraught at this perceived betrayal several generals controlling paratrooper divisions in algeria and the french foreign legion attempted another coup only for the effort to collapse thanks to a lack of general army support algeria would gain its sovereignty in 1962 prompting more than a million french algerians jews and muslim algerians who served in the french army to flee to france the 1950s also played host to the suez canal crisis which would highlight to the entire world that the former colonial powers were now playing second fiddle to the united states and soviet union in 1952 egypt's pro-british muhammad ali dynasty had been overthrown in a coup orchestrated by army officers muhammad naguid and jamal abdal nasser by 1954 nasser had become president of the new arab republic of egypt and was a strong proponent of pan-arabism and arab socialism as well as an open supporter of the algerian independence movement having spent most of his early reign antagonizing both britain and france nasser went one step further on the 26th of july 1956 when he nationalized the suez canal company when the egyptians went so far as to ban israeli shipping through the canal britain france and israel formed a military coalition to invade egypt depose nasser and restore the status quo but the three powers made a critical mistake right at the outset by failing to consult with either of these superpowers before launching their invasion and when nasser began sinking ships in the canal to try and render it useless both superpowers became enraged president dwight d eisenhower blamed the coalition for escalating the situation without u.s input and the soviets were quite ready to use the threat of nuclear war as a bargaining chip to stop the israeli advance opposed by all sides the three nations begrudgingly agreed to withdraw the strong arming of the two oldest and most powerful european nations combined with nasser's massive propaganda victory in successfully holding the suez canal came as a huge shock to the international community rather than uphold european claims the united states and the soviet union had both pushed for non-interference in african affairs despite nasser's continued support of the algerian nlf this would embolden the egyptian regime and cause pan-arabism to expand its influence dramatically contributing greatly to the arabian nationalist spirit in north africa nasser was also a prominent figure in the bandung conference of 1955 which brought the leaders of six african and 23 asian countries together to discuss cooperation in various economic and geopolitical matters this conference was a defining moment for african engagement in the cold war a vital point of discussion at the ba dong conference was how the various nations involved would deal with these superpowers the united states refused to send representatives to the conference out of fear of alienating the various nato powers who still maintained large colonial territories but chinese premier joanne lee attended in person although the various nationalist movements throughout africa had often received communist support joe realized that expansion in africa would be both a drain on resources and potentially spark war with the colonial powers joe therefore adopted a moderate tone encouraging the delegates to choose their future without external interference at the end of the conference the 29 nations agreed to unilaterally condemn colonialism and work together in future endeavors the bandung conference was a major first step in the eventual creation of the non-aligned movement representing 55 of the global population as africa moved into the 1960s decolonization was in full swing of particular interest were the belgian territories of the congo rwanda and burundi having witnessed the french failure to hold on to algeria the belgians decide to decolonize all three regions starting with the congo in 1960 but the newly elected congolese prime minister patrice lamumba was condemned by the cia as a communist infiltrator which led to the west denying him support when the katanga region rose in rebellion against his attempts to centralize power desperate for aid lumumba turned to the soviets an act which merely led to his own deposal and eventual assassination in 1961. lumumba's replacement was joseph casa bobu who was much more amenable to western cooperation than his predecessor and quickly received unaid to quell the katanga rebellion but just as elections were called a communist militia group known as the simbas seized control of stanleyville and declared a people's republic of congo just as casabubu prepared to deal with this threat another communist militia known as the kilwooz appeared to wreak more havoc on the citizens of the congo by 1964 combined congolese belgium and u.s military operations had quelled the insurrections but the prolonged conflict left the congo so unstable that a former sergeant called joseph mabutu was able to launch a military coup d'etat only a year later after easily taking control of the government mabutu renamed the congo to zaire and proceeded to rule as a deeply corrupt autocrat mabutu took a hard-line anti-communist stance leading to his regime being propped up by america and the cia until the end of the cold war another region that experienced communist uprisings was eritrea whose people had never been happy with ethiopian rule and eventually united behind the eritrean liberation front or elf supplied by china the 700 year old ethiopian empire would come crashing down abruptly in 1974 when a military junta known as the durg overthrew emperor haile selassie and established a marxist leninist communist state but despite receiving considerable support from the ussr the durg administration was just as hopelessly corrupt as the cia-backed dictatorships in other parts of africa rebel groups in the late 80s would dismantle it after leading the once-proud nation to total economic ruin not all of the conflicts in africa during the 1960s could be clearly defined by cold war politics chief among them was the tangled mess created by the nigerian civil war which began when the igbo people declared the independent republic of biafra after enduring decades of racial persecution nigeria was both a former british colony and a major oil exporter during the suez crisis leading to the british government cynically supporting general yakubu gowen's military dictatorship while france championed the ibo cause the ongoing sino-soviet split that began in the mid-1960s also meant that the chinese sided with biafra while the ussr backed nigeria the united states meanwhile maintained pro-biafra neutrality with richard nixon declaring gohan's blockade of food supplies to the igbo and attempted genocide the two and a half years of war would result in a government victory at the cost of well over two million evo deaths from famine and at least 60 000 military casualties on the opposite end of the political spectrum the portuguese colony of angola experienced a period of violent unrest between the 1950s and 1960s thanks to the efforts of several rebel groups funded directly by the capitalist powers a major figure was holden roberto leader of the union of the peoples of angola or upa guerrilla army and in the direct pay of the united states despite being notorious for slaughtering thousands of innocent white and black africans and pillaging any regions that fell under his control after merging the upa with the democratic party of angola roberto formed a government in exile and an alliance with zaire despite intense pressure from the u.n portugal continued fighting back against the gorillas but as casualties mounted the war became increasingly unpopular at home and in 1974 the carnation revolution overthrew the portuguese government and allowed their overseas territories to gain full independence naturally this resulted in yet more violence when the communist people's movement for the liberation of angola or mpla took the opportunity to seize power causing an exodus of the white population the ensuing angolan civil war was yet another proxy conflict between these superpowers with the mpla receiving thousands of troops from cuba and military support from the soviets meanwhile south africa and the united states poured money into the various opposition groups throughout the country the angolan civil war was also intricately tied to the south african border war fought between apartheid south africa and namibia a former german colony occupied by the south africans at the end of the first world war rather unsurprisingly the apartheid regime itself was firmly in the anti-communist camp when it came to cold war politics making the southwest african people's organization that rose against them in namibia a prime target for soviet support the mpla would also maintain ties with the namibian independence movement resulting in south african forces routinely crossing into angolan territory to conduct reprisals having been independent from britain since 1931 south africa was easily the strongest power on the continent going so far as to start its own nuclear program in 1967 as a major exporter of arms and training to pro-western forces in other parts of the continent the regime viewed itself as a primary participant in the international struggle to contain communism yet despite the government banning communist organizations in 1950 the south african communist party would remain a powerful underground force for the entire cold war before eventually re-emerging to become part of the new tripartite alliance with the african national congress and the congress of south african trade unions after the end of apartheid in 1994. back in angola the civil war raged on for 25 years before culminating in the battle of quito quanavali in 1987. this was the largest battle fought on the continent since the second world war involving as many as 90 000 soldiers and lasting for over seven months by the time it ended the national union for the total independence of angola had dealt a decisive blow against the communist-backed people's republic of angola leading to peace talks that would finally end the fighting after over 800 000 deaths horribly enough the angolan civil war wasn't even the only bloody conflict fought by a former portuguese colony as mozambique had descended into its own civil conflict in 1977 yet again the war was fought between communist and anti-communist guerilla movements and resulted in over a million deaths and 5 million displaced refugees the last part of africa we have time to discuss today that experienced terrible interracial violence during the cold war was southern rhodesia whose government declared independence from britain in 1965 in an effort to delay a planned transition of power to the black majority in response the soviet-backed zimbabwe african people's union and the chinese-backed zimbabwe african national union launched an armed insurgency the latter had strong ties to the mozambique liberation front and even operated out of zambia while the rhodesian government would receive military aid from south africa and portugal many foreign volunteers from countries like britain and america would also side with rhodesia and for a time they fought a successful campaign against the guerrillas however things would change rapidly after the mlf was victorious in their home country and soviet-made ground-air missiles began finding their way into the hands of insurgents in an effort to halt the bloodshed prime minister ian smith ended white majority rule and allowed the country to be renamed zimbabwe rhodesia with a black majority government however neither z-a-p-u or z-a-n-u were satisfied forcing britain to step in and place rhodesia under administration until free elections could be held said elections resulted in z-a-n-u leader robert mugabe rising to the presidency in 1980 whereupon he renamed the country zimbabwe but this failed to stop the violence and clashes between z-a-n-u and z-a-p-u forces would continue until 1987 when the two groups settled their few remaining differences and merged into a single entity the cost of this struggle would be the lives of around 20 000 civilians and 11 000 military personnel on both sides by the time the cold war drew to a close in the early 90s africa had played host to several major proxy conflicts early on the soviet union and china repeatedly attempted to establish a beachhead on the continent hoping that a single strong communist regime could influence the newly formed post-colonial states to form a greater socialist union but as time went on it became clear that the african people had been far too negatively influenced by colonialism to tolerate direct rule from either superpower in the north arab socialism found fertile ground in egypt and libya leading to the regimes of men like abdel nazir and muammar al-gaddafi the latter of whom later became a huge proponent of pan-africanism alongside other figures like robert mugabe tragically the constant meddling of these superpowers in africa and the sloppy haphazard nature of colonialism also exacerbated existing tensions between native racial groups leading to events like the rwandan genocide of the mid-90s and the subsequent second congo war the deadliest conflict since the second world war [Music] you\",\n",

young republic is firmly on the back foot teetering over the precipice ritz schmidtly assures his subordinates that they only have to hold out long enough for the french and british to muster their forces the twin empires will sweep into germany from the west and between them the three allies will surely crush the nazis and save poland [Music] hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian even casual observers will know that martial ritz schmidly's faith in his french and british allies was shall we say misplaced poland fell to the combined invasion of nazi germany and the soviet union as france and britain looked on seemingly uncaringly but history continues to resist simplicity and the german invasion would set off a chain of events that would lead to a french invasion of germany in 1939 an invasion pushed into the margins of history by its utter irrelevance in the face of the french defeat the following year in this video we will turn our attention to those margins and examine the czar offensive france's failed invasion of nazi germany while the performance of the french military early in the second world war is often the subject of much mockery their contributions to the field of cryptology are often overlooked french cryptologists were among the first to break the famous enigma machine working in close cooperation with polish and british colleagues to give the allies

georges bonnet received word of the nazi invasion on september 1st the morning after it had begun france had a defensive treaty with poland but when the polish ambassador yuyus wukashevich called to personally alert bonaire to the danger his country faced bonaire had only bad news to share the french constitution prohibited france from going to war with germany or even presenting hitler with a last-ditch ultimatum without the input of the french legislature most of whom were on holiday bonaire told wukashevich the fate of his country would have to wait until the next day when the french lawmakers would reconvene as september 1st dragged into september 2nd the nazis drove deeper into poland while the traditionally bellicose ducey of italy benito mussolini began calling loudly for a summit to resolve the polish issue diplomatically bonet echoed mussolini's calls angering british prime minister neville chamberlain and foreign secretary lord halifax french chief of staff maurice gimlan wrote in his diary that the british were insisting that hostilities should begin as soon as possible in order to give some useful assistance to poland without delay they feared i believe that we would hesitate at the last moment in reality the french had already begun mobilizing their forces but gamla and his staff pushed their prime minister and bonet for time to organize an evacuation of french citizens along the german border should war break out now it would be the french army and people who would bear the brunt of it until the british could deploy to the continent which meant days of fighting before even the smallest group of tommies arrived and so even as the british pushed for an immediate response axis and allied diplomats exchanged furious cables the luftwaffe rained bombs on polish cities and the vermost drove deep into the embattled young republic the french played for time as they organized their side of the chessboard september 3rd would see the die cast for war as an initial polish defense at moiva collapsed the talks between the diplomats were ended by french ambassador to germany robert colange who informed joachim von ribentrop that at 5 p.m that day france and germany would be at war unless hostile action against poland ceased gem law still desperate for time gave a secret order that all branches of the french armed forces were to adopt a war footing at 5 a.m september 4th a full 12 hours after the declaration and when the british raf would begin moving against german targets it should be noted that gamla's seeming gun shyness was not shared by the french people they regarded war with germany as a sense of dutiful determination over four and a half million frenchmen were called up in the mobilization and they invinced high spirits and a desire to stop german aggression those on the home front were similarly tired of nazi expansionism ilfo or enough is enough became a refrain among the civilian population however there were some who foresaw calamity should france go to war with germany nazi sympathizers and french fascists warned anyone who would listen that to stand against hitler was to court destruction the vast majority of the french people were confident of victory however and these contrarian fascists were paid little mind france formally went to war on september 3rd but despite her extensive mobilization popular history tells us little else actually happened until germany invaded in 1940 a period of months known as the sitscree or phony war this characterization is entirely untrue not only was the polish invasion ongoing with krakow falling on september 6th but the french would do something completely unexpected back in may of 1939 gamla had assured his polish counterparts that a german invasion would be answered with french military action promising that it would take two weeks at the most for the cavalry to arrive but behind closed doors gamla told the british who were equally entangled with the poles that he did not intend to discourage his men by launching offensives willy-nilly stating i shall not begin the war by a battle of verdun this reflected a shift toward defensive warfare in the minds of french military planners as evidenced by the construction of the maginot line but france had a duty to perform and jem law may have been a cautious man but he did not go back on his nation's word on september 7th 1939 as the polish high command fled the nazi advance on warsaw and after much buildup and consideration gemla ordered a french invasion of germany the knight of the seventh would see 11 french divisions pour over the german border on a 15 mile or roughly 24 kilometer front southeast of zarbrooken dubbed the cotton bronze salient with the goal of drawing german forces away from poland a second wave was launched on the 9th and the reinforced french would advance slowly into nazi territory resistance was light and the french primarily had to contend with minefields and booby traps that inflicted relatively low casualties but when battle was joined it was intense reminding many of the invaders of the first world war corporal armand petit jean wrote of spending three days under mortar fire while taking shelter in a water pipe 80 centimeters below ground and knee deep in the mud if the ceiling collapses we are stuck perhaps taking a page from their chief of staff spoke doctrine on the ground called for caution above all a mindset that helped reduce losses but this risk aversion also took root in the french government at large reducing effectiveness as much as it did casualties prime minister dalai d vigorously vetoed any raf moves to bomb germany fearful that the luftwaffe would visit destruction on paris winston churchill presented a plan dubbed royal marine to float naval mines down the rhine damaging shipping and infrastructure until dalladie again protested in fear the germans would do the same to the sane the hamstrung raf would ultimately bomb germany with a torrent of highly destructive leaflets as the half-hearted offensive half-intensified meanwhile a second french thrust was launched in the west of germany with the 21st motorized infantry taking extensive territory occupying the heights around beale and woodlands around zarbrucken this new group brought the french up to a staggering 85 divisions in the region against which the german had a raid 34 with a full 23 of them being reservist divisions with little training nor equipment panzer divisions and motorized infantry were all in poland giving the french absolute dominance in the armor and maneuverability stakes the french occupied a position that would make any general green with envy poised to push deep into enemy territory with as little resistance as an elephant would face in stomping on a ground-bound sloth the french continued to advance cautiously until september 12th when gimla gave his men a fateful order they would take the momentum of their advance and utterly squander it gimla ordered a complete halt to offensive operations september 12th he further ordered his men to prepare for an immediate retreat as he had become convinced that a german counter-attack through belgium was imminent meanwhile the soviet union would invade poland on september 17th sealing the fate of the young republic and showing the world that hitler and stalin were all too happy to glut themselves on the independence of other nations the sudden stop in even these poultry attacks incensed jamlal's subordinates charles de gaulle future free french president and commander of an armored group in the anemic offensive called the effort a few demonstrations andre beaufrey noted strategist railed that the operation was nothing general jamlal true to character decided to make no more than a gesture that was our aid to poland by the time shem law ordered an end to the offensive operations the nazis had been laying siege to the polish capital of warsaw for four days a siege that would ultimately end on september 28th perhaps with the nazis at the gates of the polish capital gem law thought that the fall of poland was inevitable and this played into his decision to bring the french invasion to a halt regardless of its genesis gimlan would take his logic to dalidi who gave his begrudging ascent to the shift to a defensive posture the men decided not to inform the rest of dalidi's cabinet about the decision and an immediate withdrawal from germany was ordered in the utmost secrecy troops were only withdrawn under the cover of darkness and a screening force left in contact with the enemy to give the illusion of continued battle german troops began to return from conquering poland toward the end of september reinforcing their fellows and launching the counter-offensive dekum law so dreaded the polish government in exile arrived in paris on september 28th nazi and soviet forces would complete the latest partition of poland on october 6th and the french would complete their evacuation of the azar region on october 17th with the germans hot on their heels and eager to take a retaliatory bite out of france the vermont recovered every inch of territory seized in the french effort but their attempts to go into france were largely unsuccessful with the status quo antebellum largely restored the phony war could well and truly begin fighting largely ceased until the german invasion of france in may of 1940. these are offensive was more than a strategic failure it laid bare the critical flaws in the french army and most critically its highest commander gemlong was a man obsessed with defense unwilling to commit to anything but a perfunctory offense the timidity with which he treated the tsar operations in which he enjoyed unquestioned superiority in men and materiel until the literal last minutes utterly confounded the germans alfred yodel declared if we did not collapse in 1939 that was due to the fact that during the polish campaign the approximately 110 french and british divisions in the west were held completely inactive against the 23 german divisions general siegfried vestfall aid to erwin rommel and later chief of staff for von roonstedt wrote that if the french had actually tried they could have blazed from the french border to the rhine river in two weeks this sentiment was shared by franz halder chief of army high command who opined if the french had used the opportunity presented by the engagement of nearly all of our forces in poland they would have been able to cross the rhine without our being able to prevent it and would have threatened the roar which was decisive for the german conduct of the war gamla was well and truly presented with an opportunity to change the course of history and let it pass him by gen law's passivity would have repercussions throughout the french army the men who marched into the tsar were as said before in high spirits and ready to counteract nazi aggression but as they found their offensive stalling out due to not enemy effort but their commander's apparent caution morale plummeted inaction was the primary factor cited and it created an atmosphere of depression and carelessness the french had come to strike back defend poland and stop hitler once and for all instead they were marching from deserted village to deserted village wandering through minefields and occasionally meeting some intense but limited german resistance french casualties totaled 1878 for the operation while the germans acknowledged a total of 666 a relatively low number compared to the rest of the war a war that the nazis would soon bring to france's doorstep and the germans would prove far more aggressive than the toothless french under gemlon between the end of the tsar offensive and the fall of france the allies would do little more than mark time modern historians cite this period of inaction as a critical blunder a time in which the allies could have refined their strategies and built up materiel as the germans did whether this was simple war wariness some mistaken belief that hitler was finally sated or disbelief that another conflict was inevitable is debated to this day what we can say is that the czar offensive was an utter failure succeeding in penetrating german territory and placing the french in a position to well and truly take the war to hitler only to collapse under the weight of its commander's fear could the french have ended the second world war in its opening months could an anglo-french force riding the momentum of a vigorous offensive in the tsar region come up behind the vermost as they arrayed their full strength against poland and brought the bronze eagle crashing down to earth that's a question

south mountain battles lee's army of northern virginia was able to consolidate around the town of sharpsburg mcclellan did not pursue the rebel forces for a full two days after south mountain his men arriving at sharpsburg on september 16th and major general joseph hooker's first corps crossing the antietam creek to engage the rebels outermost defenses that afternoon lee took this skirmish as a sign that mcclellan would focus his attack on the confederate left and he gave command of the flank to the legendary stonewall jackson the rebel center and right were given to general james longstreet and lee placed his cavalry in any gaps between his sides and center though hooker's skirmishing would appear to telegraph the union strategy we do not know the exact federal battle plan hooker's movements indicate that mcclellan planned to use a strategy known as an echelon assault a series of pushes against various points of the enemy line in sequence pushes the enemy must constantly commit and recommit their reserves to push back this theoretically leads to the enemy both running out of reserve troops and expending their energy turning back a series of assaults by fresh formations eventually breaking under one crucial push mcclellan's echelon assault would begin with hooker on the confederate left then move to the center with pushes under generals mansfield and sumner before the pudegra would be delivered by facial hair pioneer general ambrose burnside however confusion in the federal command would see troops deployed throughout the night with the reserves sent to reinforce hooker at 2 30 in the morning receiving little time to rest before the battle began [Music] 5 43 am september 17th general hooker's men march south towards dunker church assuming they are circling around the confederate flank and outmaneuvering the rebels but roughly half an hour's march brings the federals into contact with stonewall jackson's forces who hold a line stretching from a cornfield to the east woods the federals drive the confederates from the eastwoods and the cornfield squeezing them into the westwoods and bringing them into range of the 14 confederate guns on nicodemus hill poker sends 26 pieces to counter the rebel artillery as major general ricketts launches an overwhelming assault on the rebs driving straight into the center rickett's men meet seven confederate brigades and shatter them devastating the confederate position in under two hours of intense battle even the legendary stonewall division was severely mauled in the assault and general lee saw his flank nearing collapse luckily for the confederacy mcclellan's echelon assaults mean that the rest of lee's army is unengaged and able to assist lee is able to pull two brigades under hood to reinforce the flagging line and these additional forces push back against the federal onslaught hood's men are outnumbered and hungry but the element of surprise sees the grey-clad scarecrows gain the upper hand in the cornfield federal gunners begin shelling the area and the rebs must contend with both enemy artillery and a sudden pivot by the seventh wisconsin who circles around to attack herds left the rebs are forced to go on the defensive but holds their ground in the reign of shells and the waves of wisconsinites the counter-attack has stalled out but at least the confederate flank is secure the soldiers who fought in the cornfield would recall this engagement as among the most savage in the war confederate colonel william tatum wilford would call the situation in the melee desperate while general hooker would recall that the slain lay in rose precisely as they had stood in their ranks a few moments before it was never my fortune to witness a more bloody dismal battlefield as best we can tell mcclellan's echelon assault plan next called for hooker's move against the confederate left to be followed by a drive against the confederate center by major general mansfield naturally mansfield was not apprised of this and when word of hooker's men being waylaid by hood's counter-attack reaches him mansfield assumes his duty is to support the flagging assault on the left hooker advises mansfield to dig in and not to expend his men or energy on the cornfield and the westwoods instead fortifying the eastwoods the momentum of the intended assault series is broken as the federals hunker down before being engaged by confederate infantry mansfield makes for the front and is promptly stopped by his own horse who refuses to jump a fence forcing him to lead his mount on foot around the fence line and to the federal position somewhere on his path from the fence to his men in the fog of war general mansfield is fatally shot by an unknown union soldier most likely mistaken for a rebel scout or officer the union loses a second commander when hooker is shot in the foot retiring from the battlefield and leaving one general williams in command with little guidance from the retreating hooker and no knowledge of mcclellan's overall strategy williams defaults to the offensive ordering an assault be launched from the federal position in the eastwoods the battered union forces break out of the woodline and make for dunker church securing the landmark and the nearby high ground after bitter fighting it is now 8 15 am 15 minutes pass and the first elements of the federal second corps arrive under the oldest field commander in the war general sumner sumner's men were due over an hour ago and the second advances to link up with their comrades at dunker church the combined forces drive against the remnants of stonewall jackson's line but the rebs face no grand charge that would route them as the federals come piecemeal the staccato offensives are easily driven off by jackson who is able to bring his strength to bear against each of the attacks in turn and a tug of war develops between jackson and the federals lee banking on a lack of other movement from the union sends two more brigades from his southern positions to reinforce jackson in the north severely weakening the areas they are pulled from the now twice reinforced rebels launch a full counter attack descending upon the left flank of the union counter-offensive at the westwoods general howell walker who commanded a rebel brigade at the westwoods wrote that the counter-attacking rebel divisions advanced in splendid style firing and cheering as they went and in a few minutes cleared the woods federal general gorman noted that the attack of the enemy on the flank was so sudden and in such overwhelming force that i had no time to lose and the union indeed loses no time in retreating over 200 yards before the confederate attack the retreating federals would encounter the advancing sixth corps under general franklin who had orders to occupy the high ground seized earlier to protect lines of communication but for his part franklin was keen to give the rebels a fight franklin makes his feelings known to general sumner commander of the retreating forces and a dispute breaks out over whether to keep up the retreat or turn and fight mcclellan himself is called to the front line to resolve this matter but while the rebels are on the offense in the westwood others under one general hill face a federal offense at the bloody lane a sunken farm road hill's command had been seriously mauled in the south mountain battles but over the course of the day has absorbed the remnants of formations shattered in that morning's fighting as well as other odds and ends of the rebel army the union forces under general french charge headlong at the emplaced confederates who turned them back handedly french's men pay dearly for each and every attempt and not even reinforcements from the famous irish brigade are able to turn the tide general robert e rhodes commanding half of the forces at the bloody lane spots a gap in the union line and orders a counter-charge that is stopped dead by quick defensive maneuvering on the union side rhodes orders a subordinate to take up a defensive position on the right but this order is misunderstood as a command to retreat rhodes watches dumbfounded as his right flank withdraws followed by the rest of his men the rebels abandoned bloody lane literally handing their position over to the federals the upshot of all this miscommunication and redeployment was that lee's forces were all but entirely concentrated in the north with burnside on deck for the next stage of the echelon assault to the south burnside finds himself commanding a full core against a skeleton crew mcclellan allegedly orders burnside to advance over the antietam creek bridge at 8am and sees the high ground beyond to advance upon sharpsburg an order that should have reached him an hour and a half later with the fortunes of battle being what they are hypothetically burnside should have been able to steamroll over the bridge and accomplish his objectives by noon burnside his pride still wounded by his commanders being shuffled around essentially ignored mcclellan it took a second written command followed by a visit by the inspector general the army's highest law enforcement officer to get the petty burn side moving when they finally get to the bridge burnside's forces drive confederate skirmishers away before splitting off the main force makes to fight its way across the bridge while a splinter force goes to forward the river downstream defending the bridge is a single rebel brigade under general robert toomes who has his men lay down heavy fields of fire across the bridge the union fights hard and takes the bridge in short order but due to burnside's previous stalling he must take time to consolidate his men before driving onto sharpsburg it is 2pm and the fighting in the north has concluded lee's army is spent all of his reserves are committed or destroyed numerous officers have fallen in battle and only his center force remains intact and ready but all is not doom and gloom for the confederacy before the battle was joined lee sent a message to the 3000 strong garrison at harpers ferry virginia requesting support and initial trickles of confederate reinforcements under ap hill begin arriving at a 17 mile quick march it is time for the federal assault on lee's center defended by a thinly stretched patchwork of divisions and brigades lee's only hope is for hill's main force to come and come quickly burnside's men are ready to begin at 3 pm and he orders an echelon attack against lee's position at sharpsburg the federals start strong pouring into the outskirts of sharpsburg and overrunning several rebel positions and gun emplacements but almost as soon as the fighting begins hill's main force from harper's ferry takes to the field many wearing captured federal uniforms the sudden appearance of these blue clad confederates so is confusion in the union ranks and hill's men intercept a drive from the union to swing around the rebel right flank burnside in a stunning display of competence commits his reserves to answering hill's attack the triumph of hill's arrival is replaced by deadlock the rebels hold on tight and a bloody stalemate takes hold as both sides continue slugging it out until darkness falls after all the blood and death the shattering of units and loss of commanders neither side can truly claim victory antietam is a bloody draw it is a draw that utterly devastates the confederate army however lee's men have been all but annihilated and his staff begs him to pull back but lee doggedly refuses declaring that if mcclellan wants to try again come morning he will be waiting mcclellan's men haven't fared much better however and mcclellan orders his artillery a raid on the high ground with his infantry dug in to defend it the next day september 18th lee is convinced to withdraw the battle of antietam would see 22 717 americans become casualties in 12 hours of combat it remains the single bloodiest day in american history lee's army of northern virginia left the field a hollow shell and with the defeat of braxton bragg in kentucky not long after the rebels need for foreign aid became ever more dire but lincoln's emancipation proclamation issued not long after the battle of antietam would reframe the civil war in the eyes of the world as a fight to end slavery and make supporting the confederacy untenable the confederacy's ambitions of invading maryland and taking washington went up in smoke and the way was clear for the union to strike back at the battle of fredericksburg but that is for another video [Music] you\",\n",

republics was no exception by 1987 the enormous soviet system was in shambles and the ascension of dedicated reformer mikhail gorbachev would only accelerate its demise in this video we'll explore how the many countries of the eastern bloc dealt first with the benign neglect of gorbachev's regime then the sudden collapse of the ussr in 1991 from the relatively secure adaptation of countries like hungary and poland to the explosive breakup of yugoslavia the modern history of the eastern bloc provides a fascinating look at how different cultures react to the sudden disillusion of the political entity that had kept them forcibly united for an entire generation unlike previous leaders gorbachev was eager to maintain a modest and congenial attitude towards both his own citizens and the rest of the world endearing him to the russian people at the cost of immediately alienating the powerful elites of moscow gorbachev would go on to personally pound the nails into the soviet coffin with his twin policies of perestroika reconstruction and glasnost openness the former was intended to bring the ussr's planned centralized economy into the modern era by selectively adopting proven methods from liberal democratic systems while the latter loosened the brutal soviet censorship laws unfortunately for gorbachev glasnost was primarily used as an excuse for the press to air a laundry list of grievances that previous general secretaries had kept under wraps from revelations about the 1986 chernobyl disaster to the horrific mismanagement of the soviet afghan war glasnost arguably did more to destroy the soviet union than any other single policy this was combined with gorbachev's reluctance to directly interfere with the affairs of the many soviet satellite states after decades of living under a system where even a whiff of political dissent could spark massive reprisals the member states of the ussr suddenly woke up to a strange new reality of benign neglect under gorbachev one they were quick to take advantage of in 1989 poland east germany romania and czechoslovakia all underwent spectacular political upheavals in poland the solidarity trade union emerged from hiding after being outlawed since 1980 for acts of civil disobedience in pursuit of workers rights and social change despite being officially banned the union had persevered from the shadows and even entered negotiations with the ruling communist government after the latter realized support from moscow had all but disappeared as a result of these talks the solidarity trade union won the 1989 elections and became the first non-communist coalition government since 1947. this was the first big domino to fall for the eastern bloc as poland had been a staunch enemy of communism since the earliest days of the russian revolution [Applause] even before gorbachev's reforms discontent had been brewing in east germany with protests against the government restrictions on travel between the two halves of berlin to appease the masses the german democratic republic begrudgingly agreed to relax the restrictions in the near future however the press statement about the relaxation was mishandled giving the impression it was already in effect enormous crowds were soon lining up at the border checkpoints and the dispirited guards were in no mood to use lethal force against them by the time evening fell thousands of german citizens were busily dismantling the wall with hammers and pickaxes [Music] but not all expressions of discontent against the soviet system were as peacefully resolved as those in poland and berlin just two weeks later the velvet revolution ignited in czechoslovakia after the public celebration of international students day turned into an anti-government protest riot police intervened and many of the protesters were savagely beaten but these reprisals only led to rumors that protesters had actually been murdered by the police causing thousands to return to the streets the very next day hundreds of thousands were soon on the march bringing commerce and industry to a standstill in the affected cities faced with uncompromising opposition from various different action groups the communist party of czechoslovakia capitulated on november 28th and formally ended one party rule yet all three of these incidents would soon be overshadowed by the abrupt fall of one of the most dedicated communist strongholds in europe romania held in the iron grip of the infamous dictator nikolai ciaosescu romania was a brutal police state that had so far weathered the tide of revolution without so much as a crack in its facade but on december 15th the displacement of a radical calvinist pastor for the crime of decrying ceausescu's persecution of ethnic hungarians sparked a local revolt causing the sekuritate to open fire on the protesters on chaucesky's orders dozens were killed and hundreds wounded and exaggerated rumors quickly spread among the populace that the actual death toll was far higher far from being cowed into submission tens of thousands gathered in the main square of timisora proclaiming a romanian democratic front while strikes and demonstrations exploded all across the nation in response to the continued civil upheaval ceausescu organized a pro-government rally in bucharest on the 21st this turned out to be a terrible idea as when chaucesky went to address the crowd in a televised event he was drowned out by jiren when the dictator raised his hand for silence the jeers only got louder showcasing his weakness to the entire nation the next day ceausescu again attempted to speak but the crowd stormed through the police line and attacked his party headquarters and after narrowly escaping by helicopter ceausescu learned that most of his military staff had already defected from his regime after 15 years as president ceausescu was arrested and given a hasty show trial on december 25th where he was convicted of genocide and economic sabotage fearful that the sekuri tate might rally and free their leader the organizers of the trial elected to execute the dictator and his wife on the spot and the firing squad did not even wait for orders before riddling the man known as the romanian fuhrer with over 120 bullets [Music] the death of chaoshesku sent shockwaves through the entire eastern bloc for decades communist authorities had seemed untouchable but the execution of one of its leading figures emboldened the enemies of the ussr to make their own bids for independence meanwhile in russia itself gorbachev's policies left him politically isolated with his most prominent opponent being boris yeltsin former head of the moscow communist party in 1991 yeltsin was elected head of the russian republic placing him just a step below gorbachev as one of the most powerful men in the ussr he would play a key role in the events to follow it should be noted that mikhail gorbachev's goal seems to have been to educate the masses and breathe new life into an economic and political system surviving only by leeching resources from its numerous client states but his best efforts only resulted in giving the people a glimpse of freedom and once they realized what they had been denied for so long there was no stopping the exodus in an effort to placate the satellite states now itching for independence gorbachev proposed the creation of a new union of sovereign republics with increased freedoms for member states but this only caused the old guard of soviet loyalists to openly accuse him of selling out socialism and abandoning the principles that had made the ussr a juggernaut of world affairs driven to desperation the loyalists finally launched a coup in 1991 just after gorbachev had left for his annual holiday in crimea but the radicals were unprepared and deeply out of touch allowing boris yeltsin to quickly rally civilian support faced with the prospect of having to slaughter thousands of their own people the organizers lost heart and the coup attempt collapsed revealing to the entire world just how weak the communist party had become on december 25th mikhail gorbachev formally resigned leaving boris yeltsin in charge of the russian government that evening the soviet flag was lowered over the kremlin and the state flag of the russian federation raised in its place a day later the last vestige of the soviet parliamentary system issued declaration 142-h officially dissolving the ussr with their self-governance now assured and no possibility of interference from the now defunct central soviet authority the former satellite states and ex-soviet republics were suddenly plunged into a severe identity crisis only the oldest citizens remembered a time before soviet domination and though many of the younger generations had now glimpsed democratic reform they were completely inexperienced in its implementation furthermore the deep ethnic and cultural divisions forcefully welded shot by the blowtorch of communism were starting to pull apart again leading to some of the bloodiest civil wars in history of course not every division resulted in violence the velvet revolution in czechoslovakia was followed up in 1992 by the so-called velvet divorce when the czechs and slovaks repeatedly failed to produce any coherent agenda for the future of the nation unable to reconcile their differences the two ethnic groups set about peacefully dissolving the country into two independent republics and czechoslovakia officially ceased to exist on january 1st of 1993. meanwhile germany had already reunified as a single nation on the 3rd of october 1990. of all of the soviet satellites east germany had always been one of the most powerful possessing a highly trained modern army that could have easily rebuffed any attempt at reintegration but with the ussr gone even the most hardcore german socialists knew that the writing was on the wall and east germany was fully absorbed by the west reuniting millions of families separated at the end of the second world war meanwhile belarus took the opposite approach declaring independence in 1991 but holding a single election that elevated alexander lukashenka to the office of president lukashenka then promptly dissolved the legislature and took authoritarian control over the whole republic where he remains in power to this day further south along the adriatic coast the breakup of the soviet union caused simmering ethnic tensions within yugoslavia to boil over in spectacular fashion things had been brewing ever since the rise of slobodan milosevic to leader of the serbian communist party milosevic had initially ridden a wave of serbian nationalism all the way to the presidency of serbia then promptly began centralizing power over the yugoslavian federal system in response slovenia and croatia legalized non-communist political activity and promised multi-party elections in 1990. the collapse of the ussr proceeded to kneecap the serbian communist party and finally prompted slovenia to declare independence on the 25th of june 1991. the yugoslav people's army immediately invaded only for croatia to also declare independence a few days later unable to fight a two-front war milosevic quickly arranged a ceasefire and pulled out of slovenia in order to defend the serbian population now trapped in croatia what followed was a brutal war of attrition in which both sides committed hideous atrocities resulting in the ethnic cleansing of more than half a million serbians in croatia and tens of thousands of croatians murdered by the yugoslav people's army as well as various paramilitaries though war had opened up a wound in the middle of yugoslavia the country remained intact then in 1992 the united states and european commission declared they were prepared to recognize the independence of bosnia provided all communities within it could agree on a decision in a national referendum naturally this was an unmitigated disaster as the serbian population boycotted the vote and promptly began to engage in violent acts of civil unrest the u.s and european commission then went ahead and recognized bosnian independence on the 6th of april causing the jna to besiege the city of sarajevo and the militant bosnian serbs to form the republic serb army and seize control of most of the country while un troops ran around yugoslavia performing stern acts of finger wagging at anyone found massacring civilians or engaged in cultural genocide the small state of moldova was experiencing its own brief period of upheaval the nation broke away from the ussr in august of 1991 only for the ethnic russians in transnistria to revolt backed by the russian 14th army after a few unsuccessful attempts to reclaim the region moldova begrudgingly agreed to allow the transnistrians to govern themselves however the resulting pridnestrovian moldavian soviet socialist republic failed to secure international recognition trapping its roughly 500 000 citizens in a strange political and economic limbo that remains to this day as transnistria was making its bid for independence the breakup of yugoslavia was in full swing after years of passive resistance the albanians in kosovo organized the kosovo liberation army and struck out at the yugoslav security forces prompting a merciless government crackdown that killed 700 and displaced over 250 000 when nato demanded milosevic enter into negotiations or face military intervention milosevic continued his offensive prompting nato to commence bombing operations in march of 1999 unable to counter this new threat the serbian president doubled down on his ethnic cleansing program forcing hundreds of thousands of albanians out of kosovo at gunpoint but after 78 days of continuous aerial assaults the shattered remnants of the jna were unable to offer further resistance and milosevic was forced to accept the creation of an autonomous kosovo government under un's supervision of course the ethnically motivated violence within kosovo would continue for years with native albanians targeting serb enclaves in revenge for jna atrocities despite the unmitigated train wreck that was yugoslavia in the 90s not all of the nations of the former eastern bloc limped into the 21st century with such a sorry condition after regaining independence the newly democratized nations of poland hungary and the czech republic formally joined nato in 1999 just five years later bulgaria romania slovakia slovenia lithuania latvia and estonia would all make the same move freed from the tyranny of the soviet command economy many of these ex-communist states would experience considerable economic and cultural growth but others would remain stagnant this was in large part due to emigration as younger generations preferred to simply move to more prosperous countries than to try to revive the institutions left behind by the soviet union unfortunately many of the fledging democracies that sprung up to replace the authoritarian ussr quickly fell to corruption one great example was ukraine one of the most powerful ex-soviet republics ukraine had overwhelmingly voted for independence in 1991 and elected leonid krafchuk as its first president but ukraine had a problem in the form of nearly 2 000 russian nuclear warheads a third of the entire ussr arsenal within its borders with the united states aggressively pushing denuclearization on the eastern bloc kraftchuck agreed to surrender the warheads and nuclear infrastructure in 1994. in exchange russia the us and britain all formally agreed to respect ukraine's sovereignty but ukrainian democracy soon became little more than a sham in the 2004 elections western advocate viktor yushenko ran against pro-russian viktor yanukovych for the presidency only to be disfigured in a mysterious poisoning that nearly claimed his life undeterred yushenko persevered only to be declared the loser in an election whose results could charitably be described as slightly suspicious in response yushenko's supporters launched the orange revolution a nationwide protest that forced the ukrainian supreme court to rerun the election which was this time called in favor of the pro-western candidate though debatably a win for democracy yushenko's new government was at the mercy of the russian federation's hostile economic policies and the entrenched ukrainian oligarchy resulting in minimal change the 2000s also saw many former eastern bloc nations move towards membership in the newly founded european union this was a multi-faceted process that was often somewhat adversarial with the eu maintaining tariffs against eastern goods while trying to dominate eastern markets with their own brands and international franchises while countries like poland hungary and the baltic states were quick to adopt capitalist practices other nations like romania bulgaria and croatia dragged their feet for years resulting in severe unemployment and a stunted gdp still between 2004 and 2013 11 former soviet republics joined the eu while ukraine moldova and georgia have all recently applied for membership due to russian aggression kosovo would also finally wrench itself away from serbia in 2008 with eu support a move that was fiercely opposed by both serbia and the russian federation in fact it was the resurgence of russia in the early 2000s that placed the most pressure on the eastern bloc with the rise of everyone's favorite political animal vladimir putin as a replacement for the increasingly unpopular and unhealthy boris yeltsin russia again began asserting itself as a world power after defeating the chechen rebels in the second chechen war putin spent his first term consolidating power upon securing the backing of the russian oligarchy putin looked outwards toward the former eastern bloc and immediately began taking steps to prevent further integration with either nato or the european union but russia's first open move against nato actually occurred in 2008 after provocation by georgia whose president mikio sakashvile unwisely took news of his nation's potential qualification for nato membership as a license to invade the russian-backed separatist region of south ossetia russia immediately counter-attacked extracting a ceasefire agreement within five days and causing nato to quietly drop their relationship with the defeated nation however it was not until the revolution of dignity in ukraine that putin would actually deploy military forces to support his agenda in europe after six years of political maneuvering viktor yanukovych wrestled his way to the ukrainian presidency in the 2010 election and proceeded to sell out his nation to russian influence while blatantly lining his own pockets via corruption in late 2013 yanukovych refused to sign the eu ukraine association agreement and instead attempted to pursue closer ties with russia as a result ukraine exploded in massive protests which culminated in a massacre at maiden square in kiev on the 20th of february 2014 when snipers opened fire on the demonstrators from government buildings with the blood of at least 70 people on his hands yanukovych fled to russia two days later leaving pro-western billionaire oligarch petro poroshenko to be elected ukraine's next president by 2014 ukraine's international position was the weakest it had been in decades causing vladimir putin to abruptly seize control of the crimean peninsula which had been part of ukraine since 1954. just a short while later pro-russian and anti-ukrainian forces took power in donetsk and luhansk regions both of these events were assisted by russian volunteers internationally recognized as active duty russian army personnel operating without uniforms or military insignias [Music] thanks again to conflict of nations for sponsoring this video sign up within 30 days using the link in the

       " \" hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian few inventions have had as great an impact on human history as firearms and few inventions have had as great an impact on firearms as industrialization before the 19th century firearms were crafted by individual gunsmiths each pistol or musket a unique work with the introduction of factories and mass production guns could be made in unprecedented numbers and when paired with the burgeoning fields of chemistry and metallurgy a new chapter in military history was opened in this video we will look at the evolution of firearms throughout the 19th century examining how individually made muskets evolved into mass-produced rifles and how the firepower of masked infantry was concentrated in terrifying new weapons like the gatling gun before we start i'd like to take a minute to thank kingdom maker for sponsoring this video kingdom maker which is available to download in the link in the description is a free to play

available form of chemical propellant was black powder made with a simple mixture of sulfur carbon and potassium nitrate despite its usefulness on the battlefield black powder was actually a low explosive burning slower than the speed of sound and producing large amounts of chemical byproducts in the form of smoke and fouling black powder also required a source of ignition to start burning meaning there was no practical way to design a firearm without including a cumbersome mechanism like a flintlock to generate a spark but at the dawn of the 18th century a british nobleman called edward charles howard made a discovery that would shake the world to its core fulminates high explosive compounds that could be detonated by heat or pressure suddenly a whole new world of destructive potential had been unlocked breaking a technological barrier that had stood for more than 600 years gunsmiths quickly saw the potential in fulminates leading to the patenting of the percussion cap in 1822 by american inventor joshua shaw this was a simple metal cylinder containing a speck of mercury fulminate detonated by the impact of a striking mechanism generating a controlled explosion to ignite the powder charge of a loaded firearm but european armies were hesitant to take advantage of the percussion cap and though many trials were conducted it was not until the 1840s that the widespread replacement of the flintlock began in ernst one of the first conflicts that proved the value of the percussion cap musket or caplock was the mexican-american war though u.s forces began the war using model 1816 smoothbore flintlock muskets various armories had already started mass converting these obsolete weapons into cap locks american gunsmith samuel colt had also patented the first cap and ball revolver in 1836 which became highly sought after by any u.s soldier able to afford one most iconic of all was the legendary 1847 cult walker single action revolver specifically procured by texas rangers after earlier designs failed to meet their expectations known as the gun that won the west the colt walker could fire 6.44 caliber bullets before needing to be reloaded and was considered one of the most powerful handguns in the world until the 1930s mexico meanwhile was forced to rely on imports of british brown best flintlock muskets and lacked the domestic gun industry needed to refurbish these old weapons up to modern standards back in europe the period of relative peace following the end of the napoleonic wars ended abruptly with the outbreak of the crimean war in 1853 widely regarded as the first truly modern war by this point most nations had begun issuing cap lock muskets as their standard infantry weapon and rifled barrels were starting to become commonplace but soldiers were still exclusively using muzzleloaded guns with powder and bullets inserted via the end of the muzzle and pushed down using a ramrod this imposed serious limitations on both accuracy and rates of fire lead shot would rattle around inside the barrel of a smoothbore musket greatly reducing accuracy rifled barrels were designed to grip a bullet tightly and spin it but these spiral grooves meant that muzzle loading required violently hammering the bullet down with a ramrod many potential solutions to this problem had been proposed but it was not until just before the crimean war that a breakthrough occurred in 1849 two french army captains named claude etienne meniere and henry gustav dalvinia had invented the meniere ball a cylindrical bullet with etched rings and a conical indentation at its base when fired hot gases pushed the thin lead walls of this indentation outwards engaging the rifling and creating a hard seal with chamber walls within four years the french army had adopted the pattern migne 1851 rifle and licensed the technology to the british who implemented it in the form of the p51 and p53 enfields although some older models were still in use the minie rifles were a powerful force multiplier on the battlefields of crimea being some of the very first guns to successfully combine high accuracy and long range with a high rate of fire in an affordable package but while the minie rifle was undoubtedly one of the most advanced mass-produced firearms of its time it would soon be superseded by breach loading rifles breech loading guns could fire faster than any muzzle loader but were subject to their own suite of issues the worst was that of hot gases escaping from the breach during powder ignition lowering projectile velocity and potentially burning the shooter's face if firing from the shoulder the norwegian army was one of the first european powers to adopt a breach loading rifle as its standard infantry weapon in the form of the m1842 camarader which used a unique crank operated mechanism to tightly seal the breach prior to firing but although the camarader was an excellent design the thick heavy breach mechanism was destined for obsolescence as the science of metallurgy advanced in leaps and bounds throughout the long 19th century while the great powers of europe were busy with the crimean war the kingdom of prussia was busy looking to leapfrog ahead of its competitors by adopting the breach loading zuent nadogevere or needle ignition rifle otherwise known as the dresa needle gun initially prototyped by johann niklaus vondresa in the 1820s the needle gun used an innovative new bolt action mechanism that made it easy to load and fire in any position instead of using a hammer or serpentine pulling the trigger caused a sharp metal needle to punch through the paper cartridge in a breech and detonate the percussion cap hence the term needle gun the bolt action mechanism was lightweight and the entire weapon could be easily field stripped in the heat of battle allowing for the rapid replacement of damaged parts this was an important addition as drase's design was at the bleeding edge of firearms technology the needle was the most commonly replaced part of the mechanism and the imperfect gas seal lowered overall performance nonetheless the benefits of the needle gun vastly outweighed its early problems and following the crimean war most european nations would adapt the design and bolt action features for their own standard infantry rifles at this point i'd like to take a brief moment to discuss some of the important considerations commanders of the day had when it came to new firearms by far the biggest was logistics infantry rifles needed to be cheap and easy to mass produce prior to the invention of steel casing in the mid-1800s firearms were hand tooled relying on skilled gunsmiths to produce consistent results but even after the advent of mass production military thinkers preferred to rely on centuries-old tactics conscript armies marched in mass formations so the need for individual firepower was de-emphasized more complex guns meant more training making soldiers harder to replace for many nations it was simply easier to rely on quantity over quality a great illustration of how quickly firearms evolved during the latter half of the long 19th century is found in the american civil war and the spencer repeating rifle used by some union cavalry regiments the spencer repeating rifle was among the first ever magazine fed rifles adopted into military service and one of the first to use both a lever action mechanism and a metallic cartridge spencer rifles had a tubular opening bored through the butt stock into which up to seven cartridges could be inserted nose first lowering the lever allowed a spring to push a cartridge into the receiver while raising it chambered the round leaving only the hammer needing to be cocked before the rifle was ready to fire this meant a spencer repeater could empty its 7-round magazine in less than 15 seconds to confederate troops still using mostly muzzle loaders like the enfield pattern 1853 encounters with union cavalry armed with spencer repeaters were utterly devastating with a half dozen mounted troops easily able to dismount and match the firepower of a whole platoon armed with cap locks another secret to the success of the spencer repeater was its use of a metal cartridge the first prototypes of which had been created all the way back in 1808 by swiss gunsmith jean samuel pauli prior to his work paper cartridges containing bullet powder charge and primer had been common but metal cartridges protected their contents from the elements much better and created a natural seal against gas leakage one of the first commercially successful firearms using metal cartridges was the model 1 revolver released by the smith and wesson company in 1857 which used 0.22 rimfire ammunition where the primer was contained in a small metal lip around the rear wall of the casing the spencer repeater also used a rimfire cartridge but even by the 1860s gunsmiths were transitioning to center fire rounds with the primer located in a recessed cup at the base of the round this enabled much higher powder loads allowing metallic cartridges to be scaled up to rifle calibers [Music] weapons like the spencer repeater made a dramatic entry onto the world stage they would soon be overshadowed by something bigger still something that would change the face of warfare forever that something was the gatling gun designed by richard jordan gatling and patented in 1861 with an innovative hand cranked mechanism that rotated six barrels around a central shaft and loaded them individually from a steel cylinder filled with paper cartridges the gatling gun was capable of firing not just dozens but hundreds of rounds per minute contemporary designs like the french and union aeger gun also existed but came with severe drawbacks the mitrayus only fired a single shot from each of its dozen barrels before needing to be reloaded making for tremendous volleys but poor sustained firepower the aegergon meanwhile used a complex revolver mechanism that was taxing to operate and its single barrel rapidly overheated the gatling gun was the designs that bridged the gap between the repeating firearm and the artillery piece being a crew-served weapon designated to engage enemy forces with continuous direct fire using rifle caliber ammunition astonishingly though the first gatling guns were regarded as almost useless by both union and confederate generals given their propensity for jamming and the vast clouds of powder smoke they generated richard gatling was forced to take his design overseas resulting in the gatling gun quickly becoming the weapon of choice for european militaries looking for more concentrated firepower against large armies of native troops in africa and other colonial territories in 1870 the franco-prussian war pitted german troops armed with dressa needle guns against french infantry armed with shaspo rifles though prussian artillery and tactics would quickly route the french army the newer shaspo proved superior to the dresa featuring a superior gas seal and faster projectiles that caused enormous wounds at much longer ranges realizing they were at a disadvantage the germans urgently began seeking a replacement rifle after the war ended the mauser company stepped up to the challenge with the mauser model 1871 a bolt-action design that proved far more robust than the delicate needle gun by now the age of single shot rifles was quickly coming to an end and in 1884 mauser's design was updated to become one of the first standard issue infantry long arms with a magazine similar to that of the spencer repeater soon after british canadian gunsmith james paris lee perfected an integral box magazine fed by stripper clips but single shotguns were not obsolete yet and designs like the martini henry rifle proved the perfect weapon for british troops operating all across their vast empire in such remote territories ammunition supply was a huge factor and as ammunition grew more complicated so too did the cost of shipping it out to the troops this was also a drawback for guns like the shaspo whose rounds cost twice as much and were twice as hard to make as these simpler dresser cartridges though many officers saw the potential of rapid-firing guns they also recognized that their introduction would triple any military budget overnight and create new supply chain issues that would take decades to fully address the 1880s would see two more giant leaps forward in firearms technology the first came thanks to the work of british inventor sir frederick abel who patented a smokeless propellant known as cordite in 1889. cordite was a mixture of newly discovered chemicals such as nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin that burned far more cleanly and efficiently than black powder the patenting of cordite and other similar formulas solved the issues of barrel fouling and excess smoke production meaning that it was weapons like the gatling gun which saw the largest benefits while the idea of using the recoil of a discharging firearm to cycle the action and chamber a new round had existed since the 1870s it was the work of british american hiram stevens maxim that created the world's first automatic weapon in 1884 the maxim gun with a single barrel encased in a water filled jacket the maxim gun was relatively lightweight at around 60 pounds and could be operated by one man using a collapsible tripod making it infinitely more portable than a carriage mounted 170 pound gatling gun much like its older counterpart the maxim gun was first employed by the colonial powers during the scramble for africa but with the advent of smokeless powder the frequent jamming issues that plagued both rotary and automatic weapons finally became a thing of the past and the maxim gun was soon being bought by many european powers ushering in the age of the machine gun while previous inventions like the repeating rifle had shown the obsolescence of napoleonic era tactics it was the machine gun that would finally destroy all vestiges of the military status quo that had dominated europe since the invention of the musket as the long 19th century drew to a close the arms race between nations only intensified in the span of about 70 years militaries had gone from using muzzle loaded smoothbore muskets with an effective range of less than 50 meters to magazine fed rifles that could land a bullseye over 600 meters and machine guns were quickly coming to dominate the battlefield unfortunately history has taught us that doctrine marches one step behind technology during the great war generals convinced they could replicate the lightning advances of the franco-prussian war through thousands of men equipped with bolt action rifles against entrenched machine gun positions resulting in unspeakable losses but even this deadlock did not last for long as even more advanced weapons like tanks and improved artillery would eventually break these defensive lines and render them obsolete as well if you want to experience the evolution in weapons from muskets to machine guns check out our free strategy game fire and maneuver which is set

       " \" with the stroke of a pen an italian diplomat commits his nation to the antant his counterparts from britain russia and france blot their signatures and as the ink begins to dry the three negotiators shake hands on a job well done for the past year italy has declared strict neutrality in the war between the antant and the central powers despite their former alignment with germany and austria-hungary berlin has pressured vienna to honor italian territorial demands in a bid to motivate rome to take military action against the antant but vienna has proven reluctant and their inaction has brought italy to these secret negotiations with promises of austrian territory after their inevitable victory italy prepares to go to war alongside britain france and russia hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian although italy was officially a member of the triple alliance with germany and austria-hungary the country kept itself out of conflict following franz ferdinand's assassination in 1914 after all the triple alliance was a defensive pact berlin and vienna were the aggressors and neutrality gave the italian government the ability to both avoid the privations of war and solicit the best possible terms under which to commit their military to either side in april of 1915 italy concluded secret negotiations with britain and france who promised them austrian territory that the italians had long coveted with these assurances in hand italy marched to war against austria-hungary in this video we will look at the carnage and losses italy sustained while throwing countless troops against the austrian defenses along the isonzo river a campaign that failed strategically tactically and in some cases morally given this is a video about the first world war it is only fitting

as a great war general today by downloading the great war rivals using our link in the description below as italy marshaled her men its commanders turned their eyes toward austria-hungary the two countries shared an alpine border with breathtaking mountain ranges that in peacetime provided enviable skiing and hiking but in wartime the peaks were natural fortresses and the austrians had long since capitalized on their mountainous frontier digging in and building fortifications along the italian border further complicating matters was the isonzo river which had experienced record rainfall over the last year and would continue to flood its banks through 1918. the swollen eyesonzo acted as a moat to the mountain's castle presenting the italians with a considerable offensive challenge overcoming these obstacles would require careful planning and a logical strategic vision two qualities that italian field marshal and commander of the austrian front luigi cadorna would fail to apply kedorna who is named chief of staff in the early days of the war was known for successfully reforming the italian army the force he would lead was better organized though still lacking in equipment a keen proponent of frontal assaults kedorna drew up plans to charge across the isanzo river into the mountainous frontier dislodging the austrians and breaking through their defensive lines to drive for slovenia from there the italian army could threaten vienna kedorna would pursue this objective by launching multiple offensives across the isonzo river meeting the austrians in battle a total of 12 times our titular battles of the isanzo kedorna with no one to check him launched the first battle of the isonzo on june 23rd 1915. the italians opened up their attack with a brief artillery barrage before throwing themselves headlong at the austrian positions the italians outnumbered their foes two to one but the austrians were again dug in on mountains assault after assault was thrown back and by the end of the day the italians had lost over 15 000 men and gained some small footholds on the austrian side occupying the heights overlooking the slovene town of bovets and taking the westernmost edge of the karst plateau the austrians took 10 000 losses in their defense and the action would pause for 11 days as both sides licked their wounds kedorna would take his time to reassess his strategic outlook consulting with his subordinates and wait that's not right no he ordered a frontal assault the italians launched the second battle of isanzo on july 18th with the weight of numbers on their side but lacking critical supplies like ammunition the italians were nevertheless able to carve deeper into the austrian line brutal hand-to-hand combat raged on the karst plateau the italians succeeded in occupying the strategically important mount batonica in the northern section of the isonzo front and capucho wood fell into italian hands as well enabling them to menace the austrians at the town of goriza kedorna would order offensive operations to cease on august 3rd as both sides began to run out of ammunition and will for these minor gains the italians traded the lives of 41 000 men while the austrians lost 46 000 fighting would pause for two months after this bloodbath with cadorna launching his next attack on october 18th the italians made significant strides in the materiel department in the lead-up to this engagement issuing their men adrian helmets and bringing their total number of artillery pieces along the isonzo to 1250. kedorna's main objective was the seizure of gorizia and to accomplish this he spread his force out along the entire isonzo intending to move as a single overwhelming line the italian assault was screened by their most intense artillery barrage yet as kedorna had finally begun to realize the value of artillery as a preface to his go-to mass infantry charges kadorna ordered a direct attack on bovets in addition to the main maneuver intended to outflank the defenders of gorizia this flanking maneuver was focused on the hill at monte san michele where the austrians were reinforced by troops from the balkan front under field marshal svetosar borjovic the upshot was more of the same the austrians on the high ground repulsing the italians trying to unseat them a two-week lull in the fighting saw kedorna change his strategy and the italians resumed their offensive by deploying concentrated forces on small areas borjovic and his men could quite literally see this coming a mile away and reorganized their lines to meet the italians massed formation to mass formation their elevated positions allowed the austrians to neutralize the italian numerical advantage and the third battle of isonzo would yet again see the italians fail to meet their objectives the italians added 67 000 men to their casualty count with the austrians taking 41 000. the fourth battle of the isonzo launched november 10th with the italians once again focusing on the area around gorizia the italians continued their strategy of large and costly attacks that provided little in terms of meeting objectives capturing some austrian territory and launching five attacks on monte cebusi near gorizia that were all repulsed the austrians could count another defensive victory at the cost of 32 000 casualties while the italians racked up another 49 thousand as the end of november came and the cold set in grand maneuvers gave way to localized skirmishing with both sides running low on supplies and winter about to set in an unspoken truce took hold the winter break gave the italians time to shore up their offensive and kedorna added a full eight divisions to his numbers on march 9th 1916 the fifth battle of the isonzo began with the italians trying yet again to take the area around karizia this time the italian assault yielded an actual strategic gain as codorno's men seized the ridgeline at mount sabatino overlooking gorizia it only cost them 2 000 men a casualty figure the austrians mirrored it should be noted that this battle was part of a grander strategy as the antante hoped to use the italian assault to pull the central power's focus from the battles at verdun and the eastern front speaking of the eastern front the russian brazilian offensive caused an austrian drawdown along the isonzo as troops were pulled from the italian meat grinder to shore up the austro-german lines against the tsarist attack as the austrians drew their troops down kedorna drew up plans for yet another assault on the isanzo region with a view to finally capture gorizia italian sappers on mount sabatino dug tunnels stretching behind the austrian positions the italians hoped to use underground passageways to slip behind their enemies defenses and occupy sabatino's peak on august 6th the italians bombarded gorizia directly raining shells upon their target as they launched assaults on austrian positions as the italians made gains boreovich requested reinforcements but vienna denied his plea borjovic committed his reserves to the defense of sabatino but could only look on as the italians seized the rest of the mountain in less than an hour for once the italians held the high ground the austrians retreated and the defensive line around gorizia that had so long stymied the italians disintegrated kedorna's forces capturing the main southern road into the town to cement their imminent advance boreovich's force bloodied and forced from their positions abandoned gorizia to the italians retreating to emplacements along the mountaintops to the north and east as his men occupied the long sought after grezia kadurna ordered an end to the attack the italians had finally met an objective but between their continued reliance on frontal assaults and the austrians desperate employment of chemical weapons in this battle they suffered a staggering 51 000 casualties over the 11 days of fighting this would be the zenith of italy's success and like all operations along the isonzo it was costly kedorna would follow up his spheric victory the next month launching the three-day seventh battle of the isonzo from september 14th to the 17th with romania's entry into the war on august 27th and increasing anton pressure on austria and germany codorna began to believe it was only a matter of time until his foes simply buckled under his tactics of attrition the austrians would ultimately surrender in this battle handing kedorna a minor victory at best both sides would suffer around 20 000 casualties in the fight and kedorna would extend matters with the similarly brief eighth battle of the isonzo the following october meant to extend the nova vas bridgehead even further into austrian territory which resulted in two days of inconclusive battles that did little more than further bloody both forces november would bring the last isanzo battle of 1916. this ninth battle would see the italian strike at the slovenian town of vertoiba still seeking a path through slovenia to vienna as well as along the karst plateau as usual the italians numbers proved little match for the austrians natural defensive positions and the ninth battle proved a defensive victory for the austrians but while they may have repulsed the italian attack the defenders were beginning to feel the weight of their losses and their lines grew increasingly thin confident that kedorna would continue to wear them down the austrians requested help from germany for his part kedorna saw that his own forces were wearing both out and down his casualty figures were mounting and the field marshal began to see he had little to show for it as fighting paused for the winter codurna received assurances from the french and british that if the germans provided the austrians with substantial enough support he could count on their own troops joining him in the field buoyed by the prospect of wasting the lives of other nation's men kedorna and his allied counterparts laid plans for the tenth battle of the isanto which like the fifth would dovetail with allied operations on the western front in this case the 1917 enna offensive the austrians would be rudely awoken on may 12 1917 by an italian bombardment an overture to the 10th isanzo battle over two days the italians shelled the austrian positions before launching assaults on the port city of trieste and the fortified monte san gabriela seizing the mountain would have opened up the vipako valley behind gorizia over 15 days the italians would advance to within 23 kilometers or roughly 14 miles of trieste but their drive against monti san gabriela would meet fierce austrian resistance and flounder on june 3rd the austrians launched a fierce counter-attack reversing the italians gains almost entirely for their momentary advance the italians lost 150 000 men compared to the austrian defenders ninety thousand the italian's morale plummeted in the face of this reversal of fortune manifesting as outright mutiny italian soldiers refused to attack the austrians in some locations with his men beginning to resist him but sure the austrians would buckle eventually kedorna did the rational thing and consulted with his wait no that's not right no he ordered another frontal assault the eleventh battle of the isonzo opened with yet another artillery barrage this one including over 5.5 million artillery shells on august 18th the italians poured across the river on pontoon bridges with the goal of occupying the bain sitza plateau which would divide the austrians in two and cut the austrian strongholds at monty san gabriela and monty armada off from each other the italians succeeded in occupying the plateau but their assaults on the fortified mountains fared as well as their previous assaults on the high ground the italians lost the initiative but after two years of attrition warfare the austrians were too far exhausted and underprepared to seize it for themselves technically the italians won the 11th battle but their assaults on the fortified austrian positions cost them around 150 000 casualties and their second army would find itself divided by the river a critical weakness in disposition that the austrians would take advantage of the stage was set for the final fight for the isonzo the battle of capareto as the italians dug into their positions and the austrians tried to marshal what strength they could german forces began arriving to reinforce the austrians and together they would open the battle on october 24th in a role reversal for the ages the austro-german forces were the aggressors launching a cloud of poison gas at the italian trenches the italians broke in the face of this abandoning their positions with gas nipping at their heels and hundreds falling as the noxious fumes clawed at their lungs austro-german engineers next detonated mines underneath hardpoints in the italian line clearing the way for a combined infantry assault that sent the italians into a panic as german stormtroopers led the way austro-german mortars and light artillery pounded the italians the italian second army split during the previous battle began to round the second's commander asked kadorna for permission to withdraw but the field marshal proved as dogged on defense as he was on offense and ordered the second to hold firm the italians did their best to hold but after six days kedorna relented and ordered a general retreat on october 30th the italians fled with the dramatic forces in hot pursuit weathering austrian ambushes as they fled toward home but success would prove a double-edged sword for the austro-german forces the italian retreat was so desperate and the germanic pursuit so determined that the austrian and germans outstripped their supply lines the italians soon retreated over the piave river establishing defensive lines on the shores of italy itself but the austro-german forces were too under-provisioned and too exhausted to mount an effective invasion of italy and both sides settled in on either bank of the river the retreat was a complete disaster for italy the germanic attack had cost them 300 000 casualties and morale among their troops was so low that a great many simply surrendered to the advancing austro-german army a martinet with a penchant for executing his own people had broken the soul of his forces with his constant frontal charges and promotion of harsh discipline for example a mutinous brigade of 120 men was subjected to a roman style decimation or the killing of ten percent of their number after they rebelled against their commanders and killed officers and military policemen it should be noted that it is not clear whether this single instance of imperial justice was codorna's doing but regardless the debacle of the battle of caporetto showed kedorna for the brute he was and the chief of staff was forced into an ignominious resignation the battles of the isonzo were a stain on italy's military record a campaign of attrition that failed to meet its major objectives for the austrians the isonzo battles were simultaneously a massive drain on resources and a successful defense of their frontier the fighting was isolated to ethnically slovene territory and thirty thousand slovenes died during the battles most conscripts in the austro-hungarian army other slovenes were removed from gerizia and other italian conquests and shipped to internment centers the italians there treated these civilians as enemies and thousands would die of malnutrition on all sides italian austro-hungarian and civilian the battles of the isonzo were a bloody mire without success a tragic tale told by kedorna full of death and fury signifying nothing [Music] you\",\n",
       " \" dust chokes the air of the cramped claustrophobic tunnel network beneath the city of halar the concrete walls tremble slightly with each artillery strike on the city above reigning yet more choking particulates on the hunched japanese infantry trembling with exhaustion the men clutch empty rifles or loose bayonets their ammunition long spent but despite their desperate situation the fire of defiance still burns in their eyes and the rumbling of tanks in the distance only fortifies their resolve to die a glorious death in the name of the emperor though their continued resistance seems like madness each man knows exactly what he needs to do when they emerge from their holes they will charge the enemy tanks directly using rubble for cover those with bayonets will sacrifice themselves to distract the infantry while the men carrying demolition charges will flank the soviet armor none will return but their deaths will allow halar to survive one more grim day hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian many viewers will be familiar with the island hopping campaign that the united states carried out against japan for control of the pacific ocean but the enormous soviet push into japanese occupied manchuria in 1945 remains remarkably obscure known sometimes as the august storm the soviet offensive captured over a million miles of land in less than three weeks a feat unequaled in military history in this video we'll see how a nation thought devastated by war with germany smashed the ambitions of imperial japan while simultaneously moving into a position capable of threatening the home islands themselves during the second world war the soviet union struggled with many strategic problems and russian officers had to learn many harsh lessons before they gained the

get a one month free trial of skillshare so you can start exploring your creativity today ever since the japanese invasion of manchuria in 1939 tensions between the empire of the rising sun and proletarian dictatorship of soviet russia had been high stalin was all too aware of russia's stinging loss to japan in 1904 and the image-obsessed autocrat was keen to re-author the narrative border clashes between the two nations had been exceptionally common with patrolling squads of japanese and soviet troops frequently opening fire on each other or conducting small-scale border raids that resulted in dozens of casualties on both sides additionally soviet russia had been a major source of military aid for chiang kai-shek's kuomintang offering the beleaguered government nearly 10 times the resources of other sympathetic powers such as the united states so great was stalin's hatred of the japanese that he was willing to overlook the kuomintang's mass slaughter of chinese communists so long as they continued to offer military resistance to their occupiers the only thing that kept the war from breaking out between the two powers was their preoccupation with other matters for the russians operation barbarossa posed a far greater existential threat to soviet power than even the millions of japanese troops stationed on the ussr's manchurian border the japanese were rabid anti-communists and logic dictated it was only a matter of time before the empire would strike for the japanese it was the ongoing war with america whose oil embargo threatened to the japanese economy and stall any further expansion into central asia and beyond thus the two natural enemies spent most of the war standing back to back unable to do more than glance threateningly over their shoulders at each other while they dealt with nazi expansion and allied resistance respectively the first signs of inevitable confrontation emerged in november 1943 at the tehran conference with the war now clearly turning in the favor of the allies joseph stalin formally pledged to turn his attention eastward as soon as germany was defeated by 1944 he had already appointed marshall alexander vasilevskiy as commander-in-chief of soviet forces in the far east and tasked the veteran staff officer with drawing up plans for an invasion of manchuria at the yalta conference in 1945 stalin reaffirmed his commitment to the war in the east while simultaneously managing to wrestle u.s president theodore roosevelt into agreeing with his plans to restore the territories lost by zarist russia during the russo-japanese war with his mission to avenge this black stain on russian honor granted international approval stalin headed back to moscow and demanded that the perpetually beleaguered soviet high command or stafka drag its attention away from the advance on berlin and confront the daunting task of invading 1.5 million square kilometers of virtually undeveloped wilderness on the opposite side of the country fortunately by this point stalin had accepted that competency in his officer corps was not the inevitable precursor to treason and marshall vasilevskiy quickly began putting together plans for an audacious multi-pronged assault vasilevskiy possessed a keen eye for logistics and operational planning and he quickly began assembling a force of hand-picked units known for their experience fighting in difficult terrain even as the third reich crumbled under an endless tide of soviet aggression the trans-siberian railroad was abuzz with frenzied activity dozens of locomotives ferrying tens of thousands of men into staging areas in the mongolian people's republic and primorsky administrative region vasilevskiy also understood the vital role that military intelligence would play in this enormous operation and carefully supervised the railroad deployments to confuse any japanese spies operating in the region while it was impossible to hide the build-up completely the stafka worked hard to downplay the sheer size of the force under the marshal's command mechanized divisions estewed railways whenever possible driving their vehicles directly to these staging areas by road instead of on the back of train cars while the trains themselves drove mainly at night or in harsh weather conditions where they were less likely to be spotted all told 40 full divisions over 750 000 men were transferred to the far east in just a few weeks combined with the 40 divisions already stationed on the borders of manchuria this amounted to 1.5 million men eager to see if they could make the rising sun set while the soviets were busy with their buildup events elsewhere in the world continued to move apace germany surrendered on may 8th while the war in the pacific reached the japanese home islands with the battle of okinawa imperial japan was fully on the defensive yet the allies had been stunned by the sheer ferocity of the imperial japanese army which resisted despite overwhelming odds though japan had offered repeatedly to negotiate their military government clung onto the idea of retaining their colonial empire and refused unconditional surrender determined to avoid the unspeakable bloodbath that would certainly result from an invasion of mainland japan the united states now prepared to deploy its ultimate weapon the atomic bomb astonishingly enough the nuclear firestorm that swept over japan had minimal impact on the invasion of manchuria the deadline for the attack had been set months before and though he was ostensibly still working with the western allies stalin cared very little about what happened to the home islands his goal was to gobble up as much territory and gain as much influence over the final outcome of the war in asia as possible just three days after hiroshima was reduced to ashes by the first ever atomic airstrike a soviet ambassador issued a formal declaration of war to his japanese counterpart precisely one hour and one minute later a million soviet troops thundered across the border into manchuria catching the imperial japanese army totally by surprise vasilevskiy's plan of attack was simple yet gigantic in scale his forces were divided across three fronts the trans-baiko front the first far eastern front and the second far eastern front together they formed a massive pincer movement that aimed to completely encircle japanese forces in the puppet state of manchukuo with one overwhelming charge although caught by surprise and substantially outgunned the japanese kuantang army stationed in manchuria had no intention of simply rolling over and giving up sources conflict on their exact size in 1945 but at a minimum general otozo yamada had 800 000 men under his command and could call up another few hundred thousand in reserve from manchukuo and mengjang the kuantang army was also considered an elite fighting force having spent years on campaign against the chinese and local insurrections unfortunately it had been all but bled dry by the demands of the pacific war with many of its veteran units siphoned off to fight against the united states during their island hopping campaigns given this unenviable situation the japanese had embraced the concept of defense in depth leaving the borders of manchuria lightly defended and concentrating their troops along strategic choke points and natural strongholds as a result of this approach the initial soviet charge was practically unopposed vasilevskiy had chosen his menwell and whole divisions were able to cross the difficult border terrain with ease on the trans-bagel front the sixth guard army penetrated through areas the japanese themselves had deemed impassable such as the greater king and mountain range further west a soviet mongolian cavalry mechanized corps charged straight into the puppet state of mengjang aiming to cross the vast mongolian desert and seize the trade city of calgon finally on the second far eastern front soviet forces pushed across the border and pinned the local japanese soldiers in place preventing them from withdrawing south to the capital city of changchun overall the advance was incredibly rapid exceeding soviet expectations with the first major obstacle only encountered when russian troops pressed into the halar district of inner mongolia after crossing the argonne river using amphibious vehicles the soviets found themselves engaged by a japanese division supported by a large force of manchurian cavalry though unable to halt the enemy advance the japanese quickly formed a strong pocket of resistance centered around the regional capital which housed a massive underground fortress built by chinese slave labor in 1937 as night fell the soviets launched an armored assault into the suburbs only to be driven back by hidden anti-tank guns and kamikaze troops who rushed their vehicles wielding explosive charges the sheer willingness of the japanese to engage superior forces with an utter disregard for their own lives was shocking to even men hardened by the eastern front and the decision was quickly made to besiege halar while the rest of the army continued advancing across the mountains 24 hours into the invasion soviet forces had made huge gains across the fronts leaving the quantum army in total chaos the sixth guard's army had sped over the greater kingdom mountains plunging into the central manchurian plains that held the majority of the population the japanese had barely organized a token resistance and many field commanders had lost contact with headquarters then the worst news of all arrived just a few hours after the soviet declaration of war the city of nagasaki had been erased from the earth by an atomic fireball even larger than the one which had engulfed hiroshima these two events crippled the ability of the japanese government to respond to the lightning assault ripping through manchuria between the 10th and the 12th of august the soviet advance continued well ahead of schedule with two significant exceptions on the first far eastern front two russian armies totaling nearly three hundred thousand men crashed into the fifty-five thousand strong japanese fifth army around the city of mutanchang though often described as the only set piece battle of the whole invasion the battle of mutan chang was in fact a desperate holding action fought while the bulk of the japanese far eastern forces retreated south japanese defenses were concentrated on a series of fortified hilltops which allowed them to pour artillery fire down on the advancing enemy columns heavy rain also bogged down russian tanks allowing them to be swamped by japanese suicide bombers casualties quickly mounted on both sides but the japanese continued to put up a frenzied resistance successfully stalling the russian advance for several days the second major holdup occurred when soviet troops assaulted the karafto line on the sachalin island which had been designated as a vital staging area for a potential future invasion of hokkaido though outnumbered almost four to one the 20 000 defenders were dug in and heavily fortified necessitating a series of amphibious assaults by the soviet navy to pry them loose from their static defenses unfortunately for the japanese army mutan chang and korofto were single strong points in a region undergoing rapid collapse back on the trans-bakel front the sixth guard army had been forced to halt between the 12th and 13th due to a lack of fuel but was now charging straight towards its main objectives at makdan and changchun the corps in mengjiang had also reached kalgen after hard fighting with local mongolian cavalry and would go on to dismantle the regime with minimal resistance over the next few weeks the far eastern fronts saw significant gains as well when an amphibious assault launched from vladivostok successfully captured the korean city of chongjin on the 13th however the most devastating blow to japanese morale came on the 14th when prince tsunyoshi takeda arrived in manchuria and demanded the imperial japanese army cease fire general yamada immediately countermanded this order causing a major split among his officer corps as men were torn between their loyalty to the emperor and determination to fight to the death the confusion only worsened a day later when emperor hirohito made a broadcast implying but never outright stating that a surrender was taking place all the while marshall vasilevskiy pushed his men onwards desperate to gobble up as much territory as possible before the japanese could officially capitulate on the 16th the soviets launched an all-out assault on mutanchon engaging the defenders in brutal room-to-room combat as masked katyusha rocket artillery systematically annihilated the remaining hill forts having been cut off from all communications for days the defenders stubbornly fought to the last man inflicting over 10 000 casualties on the russian aggressors before the city fell their sacrifice had been brave but it was ultimately a feudal gesture as the bulk of the japanese army would simply lay down its arms in accordance with the surrender only two days later on the 19th this was the same day the defenders of the massive fortress complex at halar surrendered having been whittled down to fewer than 4 000 men after a 10-day siege the only remaining strong point was the karafeto line whose defenders unanimously rejected the surrender order with their advance now proceeding more or less unopposed the soviets began to uncover some of the darker secrets of manchuria upon reaching the large city of harbin on the 20th the men of the first red banner army discovered the infamous unit 731 busily trying to destroy all evidence of its nightmarish biological weapons program they also discovered the mass graves of murdered chinese civilians and even japanese civilians who had been executed by the retreating iga in order to save them from the indignity of having to surrender but the soviets had very little mercy of their own and cities like chongqing and harbin were subjected to days of looting and burning although the official capitulation of the exhausted guantan army occurred on the 19th the soviets would continue offensive operations until early september when the train lines ran out they used trucks and horses when the supply depots were out of range they used air drops under vaselefsk's leadership the red army stretched its supply lines further than anyone had previously considered possible pushing from the borders of mongolia all the way to the korean peninsula in less than three weeks sakhalin island would fall on the 25th and a series of amphibious assaults on the curl islands would only end when japanese ambassadors arrived in soviet territory to declare unconditional surrender of the entire nation though modern historians continue to debate whether the atomic bombs or the invasion of manchuria contributed most to the japanese surrender the soviet contribution should not be underestimated by the time their offensive ended all of japan's mainland territories had been wiped out and over 2.7 million japanese citizens had been captured russian casualties have been heavily debated but a generally accepted figure is around 24 000. vasilevskiy's logistical genius had delivered stalin a victory that czarist russia could only have dreamed of restoring all of the territory lost in 1905 and granting russia unparalleled influence in asia this would have huge implications for the coming cold war [Music] thanks again to skillshare for sponsoring this video if you'd like to be among the first 1000 viewers

cavalry breaking around her as napoleon's squares put them to route she feels the sting of defeat marching in the loping retreat the horse bearing the now eyeless and mortally wounded duke of brunswick passing marie will live to publish her beloveds treat us on the art of war but not to see its effect the grand army of prussia crushing the stagnant french and the proclamation of a new german empire in the very seat of french vanity hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian voltaire once quipped that while many states have an army the prussian royal army had a state though thoroughly cliched by now voltaire's words are strikingly true military service and philosophy were key pillars of prussian society and helped this small militaristic kingdom become the force that would create a united germany and whose descendants would plunge the world into conflicts of titanic proportions in today's video we will chronicle what we believe are the twin historical times that made the prussian army the military juggernaut history buffs no and in some cases love from the embarrassments at the hands of napoleon to the jubilation at versailles this is a concise overview of the evolution of the prussian army one of the key factors that allowed the prussian army to win wars was military intelligence in the franco-prussian war many prussian officers had toured france in

the napoleonic wars when prussia stood alongside the rest of the fourth coalition as they made their attempt to strike down the would-be tyrant of europe once and for all but the prussian steel initially forged by the military genius of frederick the great had grown brittle and rusty over the years leaving the nation fielding a force as disorganized as it was toothless the royal army had become a haven for social climbers seeking to use military service to advance their own careers and these politically minded officers rode the coattails of their forebearers lazily implementing tried strategies that were highly predictable petty bureaucracy and rivalries between these complacent officers exacerbated the royal army's issues the net result of all of this was a force whose rank and file soldiers were disciplined and proud to serve but whose movements were ponderous and predictable von klassevitz likened the royal army to a damaged building behind the facade all was mildewed jena austet saw the french outmaneuver the mildewed prussians particularly at auschdet at this fight 52 000 prussians attacked an invading french army half their size but the prussian officers lived up to their reputation invincing an utter lack of coordination and failing to press their numerical advantage during their initial engagements letting napoleon's army launch a bold counter-offensive the imperial french routed their germanic foes pursuing the prussians all the way to berlin their capital occupied the prussians put on a brave but ultimately futile resistance with the rest of the kingdom falling to the french in less than a month this shameful display was witnessed by the men whose names would be written on the pages of military history the aforementioned von klassevitz future officer core reformer gerhard von scharnhorst organizational mastermind august von kenaisenau and future waterloo victor gebert von bluker this cadre witnessed the embarrassment of their kingdom's military and would go on to play key roles in prussia's reclaiming of her military honor but before prussia could rise she had to fall napoleon dragged prussia to the negotiating table and foisted the peace of tilset on them in 1807 hobbling its armed forces and seizing large portions of prussian territory king frederick wilhelm iii determined to not let this happen to his kingdom ever again assembled the military reform commission not long thereafter their purpose was simple find what went wrong in the fight against napoleon and correct it with vigor von scharnhorst and antwan kenaisenau would lead the commission ably assisted by von klosovitz who would later use his notes from their meetings as the basis for on war the commission's main reforms were ending corporal punishment in the ranks introducing combined arms tactics and advocating for mass conscription von scharnhorst used his part to introduce meritocracy into the prussian officer corps opening it up to candidates outside of the aristocracy and advocating for an officer's qualifications to be in peace knowledge and education in times of war courage and conduct for the next six years napoleon would campaign and conquer while prussia reformed martial training was deeply embedded into general education and while the questionably qualified officers proved difficult to sack scharnhorst's push for more recruiting gave the kingdom's nepotistic and self-aggrandizing generals a competent group of assistants at the very least by 1813 king frederick wilhelm iii had a much improved force at his disposal and the will to use it napoleon's devastating defeat in russia gave frederick his opening and as france licked its frostbitten wounds prussia moved in on the injured empire in what would become known as the war of liberation prussia marshaled a full six percent of its population to reclaim its territory and its honor though and proved the royal army still had some travails facing napoleon's forces but the sixth coalition succeeded where the other five had failed and napoleon was removed from power with the fall of the french empire prussia joined the other victorious allies in re-establishing control of the continent and stood poised to implement its most ambitious reforms yet september 3rd 1814 saw a tectonic shift in prussian society frederick introduced conscription for all prussian males over age 20. three forces made up the new military apparatus the main standing army the militia and the reserves with the entire adult male population of prussia distributed among them one way or another a prussian man served it was this conscription force that joined the duke of wellington in defeating napoleon at waterloo in 1815 led by von bluecker the prussians were instrumental in defeating and pursuing napoleon's forces launching a fantastically successful attack on the would-be emperor's right prussia once again sat at the victor's table and witnessed the creation of the german confederation which would be replaced in time by a united germany under the prussian banner the roughly 30 years following frederick wilhelm iii's grand reform saw a number of key events that reshaped the face of war in europe new weapons like the breach loading rifle and rifled cannon were introduced sanitation was brought to the forefront due to the horrors of the crimean war and telegraphs gave the world near instant long-distance communication for the first time in history as the world evolved at an unprecedented rate so too did prussia educational rigor became a focus of the army's development with examinations for entrance into the officer corps introduced in 1844 interestingly for a society as seemingly militarized as prussia's there was a gradual disfavor of an entirely military education examinations for promotion and entrance would require not only the demonstration of military knowledge but a keen general knowledge as well the focus on education extended to all levels of the military even the common soldiers unlike most other european counterparts just about every single man in the prussian army could read and write this seemingly simple addition had dramatic and far-reaching implications now men could be taught advanced concepts using books and training manuals that could be studied while off duty and even during civilian life this also radically improved battlefield cohesion and strengthened lines of communication between units never again would a lucky shot paralyze a whole platoon by killing one officer who could read orders to his men prussia's growth was not isolated to education however the kingdom was an early adoptee of both the aforementioned breach loaders and rifled cannons in the form of the dressa needle gun and the infamous gun the dresa was a breech loading weapon that relied on a pre-packaged paper cartridge rather than a separate shot and powder the cartridge contained a bullet powder and a percussion cap which was struck by a needle within the chamber to fire hence needle gun the drasa was far easier to load than a muzzle loaded musket thanks to its cartridge and breach system but the all too essential needle was prone to damage from burning powder and the elements as the action was not airtight the main advantage of the dressa ultimately lay in the fact that early adoption meant the army had almost 30 years of experience with a modern quick firing infantry weapon while the rest of europe was still struggling to transition away from the musket on the other hand the revolutionary guns were a series of breech-loading field artillery pieces made of cast steel a common example was the c67 six-pound gun able to accurately deposit high-explosive canister shells onto targets up to five miles or eight kilometers away this was almost twice the effective range of the cannons still used by most european nations additionally crop artillery shells used some of the first contact detonators removing the need to keep large stockpiles of timed fuses on hand for different ranges these advantages would prove decisive in the critical war that would see the kingdom of prussia reforge itself into the empire of germany avid armchair viewers are doubtless familiar with the importance of the franco-prussian war this key event is the linchpin of prussian military dominance and the climactic event of their military evolution this was due largely to the efforts of one man field marshal helmut von moltka a dedicated student of von klosovitz multica oversaw a victorious revolution in the prussian army greater than anything frederick william iii could have dreamt of the prussian army that marched to war against the lesser of the two napoleons would ride the rails of military modernization to victory literally as chief of the general staff von moltka had laid careful preparations for this final war of german unification he and his subordinates oversaw an expansion in prussia's railway network purpose built for the rapid deployment of troops each and every addition to the communications baltic remarked especially the railroads must be considered a military advantage it was an advantage prussia would need as von multica knew that his army was equal to if not smaller than most forces on the continent efficiency and tactics would make the difference since prussia could not drown its enemies in a tide of conscripts like the russians or starve her foes into submission with a wooden wall like the british and their navy von moltka would instead focus on speed in a grim foreshadowing of blitzkrieg less than a century later the objective of the prussian army would be to overwhelm its force by lightning fast deployment using railroads and telegraphs the prussians would attempt to swamp their enemy in the opening stages of the campaign using the aid of the railroads to shuttle their men to the best defensive positions or get them into the most advantageous position to fall upon their enemies on a broader level von multica pressed for a goal of encirclement mobilizing his forces along a broad front to envelop and crush his opponent at the fastest possible pace von mulke's mind was not just of metal and wheels ever the logistical mastermind van multica posited the idea of march divided fight united which would see the prussian army divide its forces for deployment only to reorganize into a massive force to fight a decisive battle smaller forces proved less stressful on supply lines and if one such subsidiary force was somehow set upon and destroyed by the enemy the army as a whole would survive to avenge their fallen comrades and when these smaller units coalesced and battle was joined von moltka knew that if their commanders hewed strictly to the letter of their orders the battle was lost this was the traditional way of doing battle with the generals at the top giving specific orders and their commanders following them in the most literal sense no matter the result thus von mulke introduced the idea of giving subordinate commanders the initiative to react to changes on the battlefield while still serving the intent of their orders after all as the man himself said no plan survives contact with the enemy and by giving commanders on the ground the ability to react in real time vanmultka hoped to take advantage of the training and education prussia had focused so hard on giving its officers like many geniuses von mulke's ideas were not initially well received in their time in particular the aforementioned empowering of junior officers which was dubbed aftrak's tactic or mission type tactics was seen as reckless and costly should the junior commanders falter the simple truth was that fonmotica's ideas were anathema to the prevailing napoleonic era military mindset which treated war like a chessboard with a centralized command staff manipulating the movements of each piece down to the finest detail meanwhile under the prussian way of doing things field commanders were granted broad authority in reacting to the shifting situation on the battlefield if a prussian commander saw a glaring opening to exploit a lapse in his enemy's judgment or a sudden twist of fortune he had the ability to pursue it with vigor a napoleonic commander on the other hand would be forced to watch such opportunities slip through his fingers with the penalty of immediate court martial if he dared defy the centralized command structure thus were the prussians able to out-think and out-maneuver their enemies in addition to out-deploying them after years of careful planning and training the new prussian army was finally tested in battle against the austrians in the austro-prussian war of 1866. using five separate train lines the prussians were able to storm across the border and quickly coalesce into three army groups that totally outflanked their shocked austrian adversaries the initial engagements quickly showed the value of the dressa needle gun whose high rate of fire enabled the prussians to decimate the austrian infantry at close range yet at long range austrian muzzleloaders proved more accurate and a lack of krupp guns meant that the enemy artillery often outranged maltga's own but at the climactic battle of konigrates the prussians were able to decisively outmaneuver their austrian opponents and inflict some 20 000 casualties while taking another 22 000 prisoners of war the war ended in a total prussian victory and served as a vital proving ground for maltca's new stratagems giving him time to refine and perfect his techniques just in time for war against france which broke out just four years later in 1870 with van moltka at their head the prussians were able to deliver a stunning defeat to the french ironically using one of napoleon bonaparte's favorite tactics against them the prussians victory was secured through skillful use of modern artillery carrying on the legacy of the first french emperor in the fight against the second van molta's forces were armed with the latest in breach loading cannon from the infamous corrupt arms factories the climactic battle of sadan saw the prussians reach the height of their artillerist powers skillfully bombing the french into submission and securing the victory that forged the german empire with the victory over france the german empire was declared in the hall of mirrors at versailles and the evolution of the prussian army was complete from their defeat at the hands of napoleon the first the prussians took the lesson of making war a science a thing to be thought of and philosophized over in addition to waged prussian officers became educated technocrats and a push for innovation in tactics and arms saw this small germanic kingdom cast a large shadow over all of europe from the pages of von klausevitz to the timetables of von moltka prussia's rise was orchestrated by masterful generals and logisticians united in one purpose crush their enemies elevate their kingdom and never know the shame of defeat again [Music] you\",\n",

       " \" hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian when one pictures the axis powers images of nazi germany and imperial japan spring to mind with some memes about fascist italy sprinkled in for comic relief while germany was certainly the leader of this collection of conquest hungry dictators one cannot forget about the rest of the troop throughout the second world war hitler knew that his crusade against judeo-bolshevism and non-aryans would require men materiel and colleagues to acquire enough of all three hitler had to find nations willing to come to his banner either through shared ideology or the lure of territorial gain in this video we will crack open hitler's book of who's who and get to know the motley crew of the axis powers however we will not be mentioning

the two states were fascist by design and were led by firebrand dictators with grand destinies for their people but that wasn't always the case despite adolf hitler's admiration for italy's dictator benito mussolini the duchess first impressions of the fuhrer left much to be desired italian general pietro bedolio recalled a meeting in venice between the two in may 1934 hitler did not make a good impression on mussolini he talked without stopping for an hour repeating in different words all the arguments from mein kampf and only allowing mussolini a few minutes in which to reply one might think that their ties could only worsen yet their relationship improved after the allies hostile reaction to mussolini's campaign in ethiopia hitler gave mussolini his implicit approval by sending his men much needed supplies which began a process of daetant between the two powers in time this would result in the rome berlin axis of 1936 the namesake treaty of friendship that laid the foundation for hitler's european coalition as germany and italy laid plans to expand their borders their shared desire for conquest and the reproaching received from allied diplomats drew them closer together by may 1939 joachim von ribentrop the german reich's foreign minister met with his italian counterpart galeazzo channel in florence to iron out a formal military alliance between the two dictatorships the resulting pact of steel cemented itself as the first offensive alliance between these two nations against the democracies of europe relations improved with the tripartite pact signed in berlin on the 27th of september 1940. again between ribbon trop chano and their japanese contemporary sabaro kurusu for much of the war hitler and mussolini would cooperate far more than the other axis powers but hitler kept his junior partner in the dark about much of his military planning leading to italian missteps like the half-baked invasion of greece in an attempt to match hitler's spontaneous conquests italy was not content to sit on the sidelines of the action and for much of the conflict the italian navy was a key concern for allied operations in the mediterranean sea and the presence of italian troops through the african theaters ensured that allied resources and manpower were consistently diverted to contain the threat of axis expansion which threatened french and british territory all across africa and the middle east mussolini's colonial adventures succeeded in drawing british commonwealth and later american and french forces into the region a threat their nepotistically appointed and ideologically acquainted commanders were unfit to face while man-to-man italian troops were on par with their german comrades failures of command communication and endemic supply and morale deficiencies rendered italian troops largely ineffective throughout the war the italians would ultimately prove to be a millstone around hitler's neck drawing him into the conflicts in greece and north africa sapping resources from the nascent operation barbarossa and building up a perception of italian incompetence in the halls of german high command germany would ultimately invade their former ally when the italian king victor emmanuel concluded a secret separate peace with the allies in 1943 leading to the nazis occupying much of the peninsula and fighting until the end of the war overall military cooperation or lack thereof was a result of pragmatism on both sides with hitler supporting italy when it would hamstring the allies and mussolini supporting germany if it meant protecting or acquiring resources [Music] foreign policy was a strange business for japan even before the war most attempts from the imperial japanese government at diplomacy relied on the blessings of the military which remained divided over where to focus these efforts one thing all sides agreed on was the concern about communism it concerned germany's foreign minister joachim von ribentrop and japan's military attache to germany major general hiroshi oshima took advantage of to create the anti-common turn pact signed on the 25th of november 1936. unlike the government the army was able to negotiate with european nations in a way that helped secure japan's strategic foundations something which the diplomat and later foreign minister mamuru shigimitsu acknowledged oshima's views became the basis of the army's reading of the situation in europe they knew little of world conditions they were answerable to no one for their decisions and it suited them to swallow oshima's views wholesale thanks to oshima's influence with the military the direction of japan's whole foreign policy was soon shifted to germany's favor while oshima's later influence was curbed in favor of yosuke matsuoka and the aforementioned sabaru kurusu japanese efforts towards cooperation with germany finally culminated in the signing of the tripartite pact on the 27th of september 1940. while on paper japan remained a core ally of germany japan's geographic isolation from their axis peers and disinterest in european affairs led to the pair being allies of convenience at best the closest the japanese and nazis came to coordinated efforts was their mutual declaration of war upon the united states following the attack on pearl harbor an act required of both parties under the tripartite pact japan's focus on expansion throughout asia and the pacific forced the allies to divert huge resources towards protecting their overseas possessions a stance the allies had to double down on in the face of japan's startlingly successful early conquests taking advantage of widespread anti-colonial rhetoric the japanese were also able to establish a loose axis partner in their alliance with thailand which helped to aid japan's legitimacy in southeast asia while a strong combatant when they had the element of surprise and overwhelming force the cracks in japan's armor began to show when they were drawn into wars of attrition against the various chinese factions in the west and resource-rich americans the resolute australian and new zealand forces supporting them in the east the united states could afford to fight a war on two fronts and had the spirit and resources to thrive in such a position these military adventures were only possible for japan due to a non-aggression pact with the soviets who despite representing the communism that japan hated so intensely were not a focus of military attention until stalin's opportunistic invasion of manchuria just after the bombing of hiroshima japan surrounded on all sides was the last of the axis powers to surrender to the allies at the end of the war [Music] spain was an interesting conundrum despite germany and italy's support for the nationalists in the spanish civil war francisco franco had always treated the future access powers with a somewhat cautious approach franco joined the anti-common turn pact on the 27th of march 1939 alongside germany japan italy hungary and manchu yet while the nazis and spanish nationalists saw this as a preliminary step towards a true military alliance franco was keen to set limits on the hispano-german relationship franco had the nation's reconstruction to consider which could only happen with the economic cooperation of the resource-rich britain france and united states the effects of the civil war along with franco's insistence on keeping ties with the western democratic powers meant that spain would never remain fully committed to the axis cause unlike the balkans franco was able to steer his country's diplomatic neutrality into a position that favored neither side but more importantly kept both sides appeased for the remainder of the war the most important spanish contribution came in the deployment of the voluntary blue division which was attached to germany's forces on the eastern front [Music] [Music] hungary was in a delicate position leading up to the war the country existed in a tense standoff between national conservatives led by regent miklos horti and far-right elements which included the aerocross party along with the future prime minister bela imredi under all of this was hungary's serving prime minister count powell tolecki who fought bitterly to maintain neutrality in the face of german expansion throughout europe for hungary the question of germany demanded immediate attention after the second vienna award where germany's arbitration over territorial disputes in transylvania granted the hungarians huge concessions over their romanian rivals these concessions put the germans in a very powerful position which miklos hardy acknowledged by requesting to join the tripartite pact with him eventually being granted membership on the 20th of november 1940. as a last attempt at countering german pressure towards their neutrality pal teleki's government signed the treaty of eternal friendship with the equally neutral yugoslavia in december 1940 but these plans were destroyed in march 1941 after a pro-serbian coup provoked hitler into invading yugoslavia with the reluctant support of miklos horti at this point talecki knew full well that hungary was bound to germany's fate in the war and so committed suicide on the 3rd of april 1941. he recorded in his suicide note we have become breakers of our word out of cowardice in defiance of the treaty of eternal friendship we have placed ourselves at the side of scoundrels from here miklos horti appointed bela imredi as prime minister and sought to secure closer ties with germany throughout the period of the war hungary demonstrated its willingness to join the axis through the assistance of its armed forces which helped in the occupation of yugoslavia and later the invasion of the soviet union hungary found itself the victim of a soft invasion at the hands of nazi germany after the failure of barbarossa and the revelation that factions within the hungarian government sought a separate peace with the allies with german troops occupying the nation and a new nazi-approved prime minister in power hungary doubled down on their axis sympathies committing to supporting hitler and wiping out the hungarian jews budapest would be subjected to a months-long siege by soviet and romanian forces culminating in soviet occupation of the capital and the country [Music] germany's initial relationship with romania was anything but warm the lack of western support in romania's balkan on tante along with the later signing of the molotov ribbon-trot pact between germany and the soviet union created significant obstacles for romania's ruler king carl ii even with the absolute power he was granted after abolishing romania's constitution in 1939 the issue with the soviets was the most significant for romania as they had occupied several nations along its border while forcing romania to cede bessarabia germany's pact with the soviet union lent the axis power block greater stability in dealing with the west even while hitler was drawing up plans to invade his communist partner later problems owing to the territorial disputes over transylvania with hungary also left romania in a worrying position when hitler strong-armed king carroll into relinquishing an area of roughly square kilometers to the hungarians for this sacrifice hitler guaranteed romania's protection and sovereignty in the face of foreign aggression which in effect meant protection from the soviets in order to curb rising hostility from far-right elements spearheaded by romania's iron guard faction king carroll appointed general eon antonescu as prime minister on the 4th of september 1940. for carl this might not have been the best decision as antonescu and the iron guard's leader horia sima forced carol to abdicate the throne from here eon antonescu worked with the iron guard to form the national legionary state of romania this alliance with the fascist iron guard remained tense for antonescu who stressed the need for caution even during their highest point exhorting the green shirts to put aside any thought of revenge or revolt by the 23rd of november 1940 antonescu was invited to berlin to sign the tripartite pact entering into a formal alliance with germany italy japan and hungary from here on romania seemed poised to become a key ally of germany supplying the nation with a steady quantity of much needed oil for the vermont and assisting the axis with its invasion of the soviet union ultimately committing more troops to the eastern front than any of germany's other allies combined but for all of their commitment to fascism and matching colored shirts romania would make a heel face turn at the prospect of an imminent soviet invasion pragmatism won out over ideology and romania rushed to conclude a secret switch to the allies which could only happen after agents of the monarchy arrested antonescu the luftwaffe bombed bucharest in retaliation which gave romania a case's belly and allied support romanian troops fell upon the germans stationed in their country defeating an attempt by vermont forces already in bucharest to seize the capital romania would slaughter or expel all nazi forces in their borders while also reclaiming the territories of northern transylvania previously lost to the hungarians [Music] [Music] germany's attempts to court allies were not confined to europe as early as 1938 germany sought to curry favor with the british aligned kingdom of iraq and like all good western powers interested in a middle eastern country the germans were in it for the oil a radio propaganda campaign was launched over radio zessen with iraqi announcer yunus bahri filling the airwaves with anglophobic arabic by 1940 nazi germany and iraq had developed warm relations but the iraqis pushed for explicit support from the axis for iraqi independence which they received in october of that year the nazis capitalized on this by arming the iraqis hoping to use an iraqi insurrection as a distraction to even the odds in the north african theater the result was the 1941 anglo-iraq war in which the nazi-backed iraqis deposed the colonial government and declared their independence only for britain to sweep in and reinstall friendly rulers in just one month the nazis succeeded in distracting the british by stirring the iraqi pot but the distraction was momentary at best iraq never truly joined the axis powers [Music] [Music] like its other balkan neighbors bulgaria's foreign outlook was focused mainly on reclaiming lost territory tsar boris iii though dedicated to this goal was aware of the mounting tension throughout europe and even in his own household my army is pro-german my wife is italian my people are pro-russian i'm the only pro-bulgarian in this country zarborus remained committed to policies of neutrality in the face of increasingly pro-german sentiment throughout the early war years yet even he could see the way the wind was blowing by june 1940 the gestapo was free to operate within the country any private contact with western embassies was heavily discouraged and a general rise in anti-semitism caused many jews to flee as the rivalry between the wary partners of germany and the soviet union worsened bulgaria became a focus of interest for the two superpowers the german foreign ministry viewed it as essential to make sure bulgaria joined the axis power block in order to act as a counterweight to allied interests in the region german pressure towards bulgarian neutrality finally broke in 1941 with tsar boris relenting and signing the tripartite pact on march 1st the bulgarian state provided a key role in the german invasion of the balkans allowing the vermont to stage offensives from its territory into the south while bulgaria's military would not engage in these offensives they would later come to occupy the regions of thrace and macedonia after the capitulation of greece and yugoslavia respectively the bulgarian air force would also commit resources to protecting the romanian oil fields from allied bombing runs while the navy would send small naval forces to protect bulgarian shipping lanes in the black sea continuing a trend bulgaria remained with the axis powers until 1944 when a military coup installed the anti-fascist fatherland front which declared war on germany and aligned itself with the soviet union [Music] after a bitter period of fighting off communist forces from the east the finns were forced to concede to the soviet union on the 13th of march 1940. throughout this period the national socialists of germany were sympathetic to finland's struggle which in turn helped develop relations after the war's end a shared animosity for communism became the most immediate route for german ties to finland on the 17th of august 1940 german lieutenant colonel joseph valjeans approached finland's famous commander carl gustav mannerheim to arrange free passage through finland in the event of war with the soviets vettiens also invited the finn's war material and machinery through him president risto rudy keen not to deprive his nation of international support after the winter war instructed manheim to accept the german request for troop movements and on the 3rd of june 1941 germany officially pledged to assist finland with any war against the soviet union meanwhile detailed plans for this eventual conflict were drawn up during a secret conference in kiel germany though finland would not enter operation barbarossa alongside the germans in june of 1941 it wasn't until november 25th that they would officially sign the anti-common term pact whether finland was a true member of the axis is still debated but their contributions to the axis offensive on the eastern front were undeniable with the finnish military deploying offensive forces into the soviet-held carillion ismus and later fighting on the defensive manoheim line all the way until their ceasefire with the soviets in 1944 after that finland fought a bitter war in lapland against the germans attempting to dislodge the withdrawing 20th mountain army until germany's surrender in 1945. diplomacy is never an easy task it can be difficult in peace but even harder during the threat of war for germany the need for alliances forced them to find compromises in a time when ruthlessness and pride was the key to success it's because of all of this that the axis comprised a strange membership some nations you might have expected to see and some you might have never thought to join with the fascists yet here they were ultimately the strength of these partnerships compared only to the strength of germany itself leading to defeat and dissolution in the face of a world dominated by the allies [Music] [Music] [Music] you\",\n",
       " \" hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian during the second world war many nations occupied by the fascist powers developed underground movements dedicated to seeing their countries liberated from axis oppression while many of these groups caused considerable damage and disruption to their occupiers none were more successful than the yugoslavia partisan movements though starting off as little more than a fractured collection of independent gorilla bands with wildly differing goals and ideologies the men of yugoslavia would eventually be welded together into a fighting force that could stand up to the third reich in ways that no other insurgency could ever hope to match while the red army would be instrumental in dislodging the nazis from the country in 1945 their arrival would be little more than the final blow against german occupation among the many issues faced by resistance movements is that of communication if your country has a hugely diverse population of at

impressive when one considers their unenviable geopolitical situation prior to war in addition to sharing a land border with both the original axis powers germany and italy yugoslavia was a nation in name riven from within by endless social ethnic and political issues with a citizenry comprised of serbians bosnians croatians slovenians and a dozen other minorities yugoslavia had stumbled from democracy to dictatorship before finally entering the 1940s under the control of prince paul who was acting as a regent for his teenaged relative peter ii until the latter came of age with a pathetically obsolete military shambling economy and numerous german croatian and slovenian fifth columns busily undermining his central authority prince paul was in an incredibly precarious position by 1941. though a determined anglophile who spent most of his free time in britain paul was repeatedly courted by the axis powers who were desperate to secure yugoslavia's natural resources completely out of his depth and knowing full well that his nation stood no chance against either germany or italy paul was forced to choose the path of appeasement by signing the tripartite pact on march 25th 1941. but paul had already infuriated his serbian dominated military by making concessions to the croatians earlier in his regency and they promptly orchestrated a coup that placed the now 17 year old peter ii in charge by now yugoslavia was completely surrounded by the axis powers and the new government immediately opened desperate negotiations with the allies in the hopes of somehow averting the inevitable unfortunately for yugoslavia hitler took the coup as a personal insult and swore to destroy yugoslavia as a state in revenge the german high command quickly scrambled to create an invasion plan and on april 6th the luftwaffe launched huge bombing raids on yugoslavia's airfields and the capital city of belgrade this was immediately followed by a massive land invasion that saw german troops pour into yugoslavia from four separate directions the invasion was spearheaded by the german second army aided by the 12th army and the first panzer group with their air force having been all but obliterated in the opening strike the royal yugoslav army now faced the full might of the axis on five separate fronts with italy and hungary joining in on the fun on the 11th and 12th of april respectively spread far too thin and wielding an arsenal of charmingly outdated castoffs from a dozen different nations the army failed to even mobilize before the invasion was underway predictably the sole victory of the royal yugoslav army was against the italians in albania with all other units being utterly overrun within a matter of days belgrade fell to german hands on the 13th of april and the nation was forced to agree to an unconditional surrender on the 18th the invasion had taken just 12 days and cost the axis forces just a few thousand casualties in exchange for gaining over 200 000 yugoslavian prisoners of war peter ii was forced to flee into exile abroad finding refuge with the british he would never return to his homeland in the wake of their capitulation yugoslavia ceased to exist as a sovereign state just as hitler had promised serbia became a german-occupied zone while croatia became a nazi puppet under prime minister ante pavlich lastly the italians claimed lublana and most of dalmatia leaving the nation effectively dismembered along ethnic lines yet remarkably the ink on these surrender terms barely had time to dry before the first resistance movements against the occupation began to coalesce remnants of the royal yugoslav army who survived the initial invasion fled to the mountainous regions of serbia and bosnia where colonel draja mikhailovic took command and began organizing them into a guerrilla movement [Music] meanwhile a serbo-croatian communist called yosef tito saw the invasion as a chance to see his dream of a socialist yugoslavia come to fruition and immediately set about raising a partisan force that would engage in direct combat with the occupying forces while the royalists and communists were busy forming their resistance movements the new german puppet state of croatia was busy planning the genocide of anyone who is not a fascist croatian after his ascension prime minister ante pavlich moved with astonishing speed to abolish all other political movements and declare the death sentence for every possible crime against the state pavelic was completely unrepentant about his plans to annihilate the serbian roma and jewish populations of his new state and empowered his ultra-nationalist ustashi organization to enforce this ethnic cleansing the actions of the ustashe combined with the general anarchy that gripped yugoslavia immediately following the occupation proved a boon for the rebel forces particularly the communist when joseph tito had heard that the germans had issued a decree stating that 100 civilians would be shot for every german soldier killed by the insurgencies he quickly realized how to use this to his advantage now after each successful raid his men offered any bystanders a simple choice join the partisans on the spot or wait patiently for an extermination squad to arrive and murder them all knowing that being caught within five miles of a single german corpse was now a death sentence whole villages defected to the partisans on the spot this tactic was so effective that in late autumn of 1941 tito successfully liberated the town of ujitse proclaiming it as its own republic royalist guerrillas under colonel mikhailovic also participated in the liberation but by this point he had been contacted by the government in exile and was understandably wary of cooperating with the openly communist partisans [Music] before the new republic was even a month old relationships between mikhailovic and tito had collapsed by the time the german forces rolled into the area a civil war was already in full swing and the disorganized insurgents were easily driven out of the region following the fall of the republic of ujitse tito's partisans began to cautiously regroup in bosnia while mihailovich was left to court the favor of the western allies he was irritated to discover that his royalists had come to be known as the chetniks by allied intelligence a name associated with several nominally independent groups within yugoslavia including the black chetniks who directly collaborated with the germans mihailovich however still viewed his men as part of the royal yugoslav army and continued to refer to them in such terms though endlessly praised as a hero of the resistance movement in yugoslavia by the bbc mikhailovich was given very little material support by the allies leaving him in no position to wage an effective resistance instead he contacted the government of occupied serbia and began to quietly collaborate with the axis forces in the hopes of preventing tito's partisans from triggering any more reprisals against native serbians in contrast to his royalist opposite yoseph tito took immediate advantage of operation barbarossa by launching a general offensive against the depleted german forces in yugoslavia tito's forces had several major advantages over mihailovich's chetniks chief among them being access to a core of veteran soldiers from the spanish civil war and a much broader base of support from yugoslavia's multi-ethnic population yet above all other factors support for the insurgencies was principally driven by the utter callous disregard of the occupiers for the well-being of yugoslavia's citizens no matter what their origin yet even with all of these advantages the potential liberators of yugoslavia still faced an uphill battle against a deeply entrenched position at the start of 1943 the germans launched case white a massive offensive against partisan-held territories in bosnia over 90 000 german and italian soldiers were involved alongside as many as 15 000 chetnik collaborators though tito's roughly 20 000 men would suffer over 50 casualties in the battles that followed they were able to inflict heavy losses on the much better equipped axis forces the turning point was the battle of naretva river where tito was able to force a crossing into safe territory despite facing overwhelming odds and despite his miraculous survival tito had very little time to rest his men before the germans launched the sequel to case white unimaginatively titled case black this time involving nearly 120 000 soldiers case black was arguably the darkest day for the partisans as their headquarters was encircled and tito himself came very close to being captured or killed in desperation the partisans threw themselves against german and croatian troops guarding the suyesca river managing a second breakout in as many months in retaliation the germans slaughtered over two hundred thousand wounded and injured partisans who were left behind and conducted numerous massacres in the surrounding villages but tito lived to fight another day as summer drew to a close the communists had a chance to go to ground and recover from their losses late 1943 would also see a major shift in the balance of power in the underground as allied agents began infiltrating yugoslavia in order to make sense of the many chaotic reports filtering back to them about the situation in the area the agents quickly determined that mikhailovich's chetnicks had all but switched sides and that tito's partisans were the primary source of resistance within the nation as a result the allies withdrew support from the chetnix and threw their support behind josep tito 1943 was a pivotal year for the partisans in more ways than one on september 8th the italians concluded a secret armistice with the allies leaving 17 of their divisions trapped in yugoslavia in a remarkable show of defiance two whole divisions immediately switched sides and joined the montenegrin partisans while another joined the albanian partisans the remaining 15 either surrendered to the axis and were taken prisoner or quietly disbanded and allowed their equipment to fall into the hands of the insurgents this came just in time for the partisans as the germans launched operation kugelblitz or ball lightning against partisan health territory in the state of croatia by now axe's strategy was simple destroy everything kill everyone and burn anything that could be of any possible use to the insurgency and ante pavilig's ustashe had already killed between 250 000 and 700 000 serbians and ethnic minorities within yugoslavia but the wildly disproportionate brutality of the ustashe only served to drive thousands of willing recruits directly into tito's arms by early 1944 operation kugelblitz had petered out having accomplished nothing besides galvanizing even more of the remaining population into open acts of defiance but tito's trials were not over yet as the germans had one last card up their sleeve operation rosso sprung or knights move though only consisting of about 12 000 troops this assault was the most well planned and surgically minded of the seven major offensives launched against the partisans involving an airborne assault by the 500th ss parachute battalion on the resistance hq in the bosnia town of durvar tito himself was present in the hq and was forced to take cover in a nearby cave while the partisans fought a desperate defense of their leader the allies sent help in the form of the balkan air force which launched numerous sorties against the luftwaffe and german ground forces as chaos reigned tito was able to break away from the engagement and retreated toward the town of cupress though as many as 6 000 partisans were killed in operation russell sprung the germans were eventually forced to retreat their forces having been decimated in the mountainous terrain around durvar the failure of this last major anti-partisan operation signaled a permanent reversal in tito's fortunes by now the yugoslav partisan movement had become the largest in occupied europe with over 700 000 men now openly involved in the liberation just a month after having to abandon durvar tito successfully negotiated an agreement with the yugoslav government in exile becoming recognized as yugoslavia's sole legitimate military leader on august 17th tito leveraged his newfound status to the hilt declaring amnesty for all collaborators this was backed up by a broadcast from king peter ii himself on the 12th of september calling for all yugoslavians to join the national liberation army under the leadership of marshall tito this was a devastating blow to mihailovich and his chetnicks and the movement practically collapsed on the spot with most of his men defecting to the partisans now that the dominoes had begun falling nothing could stop them furthest to the east the red army had reached the borders of bulgaria which promptly switched sides and declared itself an allied power this gave tito direct access to soviet military support and on the 8th of october a combined bulgarian soviet offensive stormed across yugoslavia's southern border and pushed north all the way to belgrade in less than three weeks as winter gripped the land tito found himself in unchallenged control over the entire eastern half of the country while the remaining axis forces were frantically redeploying in syria during the winter of 1944-45 tito took the offensive and threw wave after wave of partisans against the sirmian front but was repulsed by the entrenched enemy armies he also expanded operations in central serbia and began laying the groundwork for a communist regime in yugoslavia no longer the underdog the partisans now began conducting their own reprisals against native germans serbians croatians and hungarians executing or imprisoning them in the tens of thousands seeing they would get no mercy from the communists the fascist croatians abandoned the sermian front and surrendered to the western allies as the croatians wavered the remaining chetniks made a last-ditch attempt to win recognition by engaging them in the battle on liev jeff field where they were promptly defeated with their supply lines in ruins from constant partisan raids the remaining germans holding syrimia knew the end was in sight in april tito's forces launched their final offensive seizing sarajevo and dismantling what remained of the independent state of croatia the last axis defensive lines collapsed just a few days later and the germans began a full-scale retreat out of yugoslavia not content with simply letting them go tito's forces pursued and engaged a column of nearly 30 000 german soldiers at the battle of polana which actually took place days after the official nazi surrender on may 8th this final battle between partisan and axis forces ended when british tanks arrived on scene whereupon the germans surrendered and allowed the remaining collaborators among their ranks to be delivered back to tito's forces for judgment with this last enemy force disarmed tito's communists were at last the unchallenged masters of yugoslavia the liberation of yugoslavia was one of the most remarkable feats of the second world war the partisans had grown to outnumber their occupiers and were in control of huge swathes of territory governed by a communist bureaucracy not even the vaunted french resistance accomplished even a quarter of what yoseptido did but the cost was immeasurable yugoslavia was left a ruined nation with at least a million dead and millions more displaced by the brutal ethnic conflicts the end of the war brought no relief as tito's partisans conducted a ruthless purge of the remaining fascist and nationalist elements in yugoslavia known as the blyburg repatriations these reprisals added at least thirty thousand corpses to the pile and would leave deep scars in the national psyche that linger on to this day for all his support of the partisans king peter ii would die in exile in denver colorado mikhailovic would be hunted down in 1946 and executed for his collaboration with the nazis while tito would go on to found the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia which lasted until 1992 with the collapse of the entire country\",\n",

us the whites had formed a national government that was staunchly anti-communist but was well aware that the USSR was the regional power in their corner of Europe thus the Finns walked a tightrope as they sought to protect their independence without provoking a second Russian invasion and a central tenet of this Balancing Act was seeking out foreign aid the Weimar Republic heir to the Finn's Imperial German allies maintained cordial relations with the Soviet Union disappointing pro-german elements in Finland and putting the kibosh on future military assistance from Berlin the British Empire who Finland had previously granted access to Naval bases was uninterested in any talks Beyond trade negotiations lacking powerful allies Finland settled into a holding pattern wary eyes cast East towards their wants and future enemy the Ascension of Adolf Hitler would upend this stalemate the Nazis were even more anti-communist than the whites and Hitler ended the datant enjoyed by Weimar Germany and the Soviet Union his Manifesto Mein Kampf called for a literal war against the ideology of Communism itself the Finns were heartened by this development though there were very few fascists in Finland there was hope that Germany would offer a counterbalance to the Soviet Union Baron Carl Gustav manerheim leader of the whites in the Civil War and a founding father of Finland had long worried about the modernization and mechanization of the Soviet Red Army and spoke of how the French had burned up their military budget with the imagino line and the British had allowed themselves to become militarily complacent the pragmatists in Helsinki matterheim among them began to realize that the fate of their nation was slipping out of their hands and into those of the great Powers who resisted demilitarization namely the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany as early as 1935 Soviet officers began making conspicuous trips to the Finnish Frontier resulting in railroad Spurs that began to crawl mile by mile toward Finland in 1938 Soviet diplomats approached Helsinki with requests to negotiate a new Finnish Soviet border despite mannerheim's lobbying to sit with the Reds Helsinki declined it mattered little to the Soviets as the next year they signed the molotov ribbon draw pact the secret Protocols of which put Finland in the Soviet sphere of influence the Nazis and Soviets began expanding in accordance to The Pact in 1939 and Finland hurriedly fortified her eastern border volunteers constructed the manorheim line which would go on to serve the Finns well in October the Soviets approached the Finns with a new request to lease strategically important territory within Finland and a declaration of Finnish Military Support in exchange the Finns were assured their continued Independence and peace with these Soviets there were many Finns including the ever eager manorheim who saw through this charade scores of Finns reported to recruiting stations even far-left social Democrats signed up to fight Soviet aggression that aggression would come steaming into Finland at eight o'clock in the morning on November 30th 1939 this winter war was meant by the Soviets to be a blowout Victory and their initial thrusts into Finland were met with absolutely no chance of victory the dogged Finns stood firm bogging the underprepared Soviets down and inflicting heavy losses on them the entire offensive lurched to a stop the Soviets had spread their troops along the entire Finnish border stretching their forces too thin to mount an effective offense and the Reds sat dead in the water until February 1st of 1940. second verse same as the first the Red Army stormed into the carillion Isthmus a strategically critical area of Finland with 30 infantry divisions and strong artillery and air support only to again be stopped in their tracks by the Finns and their manorheim line one of the Finns facing the Soviet Onslaught was Simo hauha the legendary white death cyan of a farming family Simo had spent his childhood hunting and skiing skills many other Finns had developed throughout the winter War how would become a veritable Boogeyman to the Russians racking up over 500 confirmed kills and surviving numerous Soviet attempts on his life the Soviets hemorrhaging Manpower in the face of Finnish Defiance dug in their heels and kept leaning finally breaking through the enemy line on February 13th within two weeks these Soviets had pushed deep into Finland driving the finish right to the city of vipery Finland was on the ropes for troops battling exhaustion as much as the Soviets and supplies had drawn critically low France and Britain offered to send an expeditionary Force to Aid Finland if Norway and Sweden would provide staging grounds Norway and Sweden told Helsinki that they would not allow troops onto their soil sailing finland's fate March 13th would bring the end of hostilities and the two sides entered what would be called the interim piece which saw Finland seed land to the Soviets and the Soviets refrained from annexing the entire nation as the blood in the snow dried Finland set about preparing for the next fight against the Soviets The Finnish population emerged from the war shaken but resolved to carry on over 24 000 Finns fell in battle including the white death Simo hauha who was killing by a Soviet infantryman's high explosive bullet was reported in The Finnish newspapers only for hawaha to spring back to life on the same day the winter war ended and undergo a marathon of surgeries that left him alive but permanently disfigured the inhabitants of the carillion Isthmus which the Soviets annexed in the peace were given only 10 days to cross the newly redrawn Finnish border 420 000 people grabbed whatever they could carry and left their ancestral homes behind but were welcomed to new homes by their countrymen tracks of private land were nationalized and were given to the refugees to rebuild on Veterans of the Civil War white and red alike formed Brothers in armed societies to socialize and keep Spirits high in the company of fellow soldiers these were countered by The Finnish Soviet Union piece and friendship society a moscow-backed fifth column ordered to provoke a justification for a new Soviet attack the government doubled the length of conscription and launched a charm offensive on neighboring countries to conclude defensive alliances throughout the end of March 1940 Finland lobbied Norway Sweden and Denmark to form a Nordic Mutual defense network but the Soviets issued a public declaration that any country signing any alliance with Finland would be declaring themselves an enemy of Global Peace and more importantly the Soviet Union Norway Sweden and Denmark stopped returning finland's calls not long thereafter and by Spring of 1940 Norway and Denmark had been occupied by Germany France had fallen and Finland found itself not only politically isolated but with Soviet and German troops on her borders speaking of the Germans the fall of Norway led to the opening of diplomatic channels between the Nazis and Finns initial contact focused on allowing German troops on leave from posts in Norway free Passage through Finland and welcoming Finland to purchase weapons and raw materials from Germany as relations improved Finnish Major General Pavo talvilla began making regular trips to Berlin taking the Germans temperature on a defensive treaty against these Soviets at the end of May 1941 a delegation from finland's high command led by Chief of Staff oxield heinrichs took a meeting with German Chief of Staff Alfred yodel yodel gave heinrichs a briefing on Operation Barbarossa which he dutifully related to Helsinki the Finns smelled blood in the water here was the military Alliance that had so long eluded them the two countries Inked a deal Germany would support Finland in any future Wars against the Soviets and the Finns would support Germany if Barbarossa triggered a Soviet invasion of Finland to save thee fins threw themselves into their new alliance would be an understatement a secret Conference was held in Kiel where Finnish and German planners laid out designs for jointly laid minefields in the Gulf of Finland and the Finns opened their airfields at malm and ute to the luftwaffe on June 5th manorheim reactivated talvilla a prizing him of the results of the Keel conference and sharing Germany's timetable for invading the Soviet Union he concluded by asking talvilla to take command of a Finnish task force that would lead the German drive to Leningrad talvila enthusiastically replied I accept and this is the greatest moment of my life Finnish defense minister Rudolph valden ordered full mobilization on June 17th and the Finns were able to call up 630 000 men and women for their anticipated War one of whom was our old friend Simo hauha whose attempts to join a combat unit were rejected the white death would be assigned to the horse call-up board and set his sights on determining which equine fins should be drafted for service odd assignments or not optimism was high in The Finnish populace the populace as a whole believed that the Nazis would be quick to reach their objectives in Russia and with a swift German Victory most Finns would be demobilized [Music] when the Germans poured over the Soviet border on June 22nd the Finns remained behind but that meant nothing to the Reds the Soviets launched a massive bombing and shelling campaign on the Finnish border with neither a declaration of war nor a Finnish attack to justify their assault the Finns submitted an official letter of reprimand to the Soviet Ambassador who ignored it entirely on the 23rd Soviet foreign minister Molotov demanded the Finns lay out their position on their allies Invasion and promptly cut the phone line to Helsinki after all it's far easier to claim the other party is refusing to be diplomatic if there's no way for them to speak with you on June 25th 1941 the Soviets launched an early morning bombing raid on Finnish civilian targets with 487 aircraft dropping Ordnance on cities including Helsinki the interim piece was over the Finns watched as the Germans drove into Soviet territory waiting for their time to join The Fray The Finnish government took great plans to portray themselves as a co-belligerent fighting a common enemy alongside the Germans never concluding a formal alliance with the Nazis the ministers and Helsinki knew it was vital to portray this as a war to reclaim territory and defend against Soviet aggression on July 10th the Germans crossed the river dalgava which was the pre-arranged time for the Finns to attack the continuation war was on 475 000 Finnish soldiers charged against these Soviets who had directed their best men to defend against the main German assault Soviet disposition meant that the Finns enjoyed air superiority and the Tactical advantage and they overran these Soviets in the carillion Isthmus and other territories lost in the winter War but this was not the end of Finnish Ambitions they meant to make for Leningrad just as they promised the Finns split their forces with some digging in to defend the carillion Isthmus While others crossed into Soviet territory Finnish forces reached the river sphere on the 7th of September and it was here that these small Nordic Republic could have sealed the fate of the Soviet juggernaut if the Germans had linked up with the Finns at the sphere as originally planned they could have caught leningrad's shipping lanes over Lake ladoga bottling up the city in a Complete Siege but the Germans were halted 100 kilometers or about 62 miles from the river The Finnish halt at the sphere marked the end of offensive operations for the rest of the war the momentum was shifting and soon the Finns would find themselves fighting a desperate three-year defense finland's fortunes were directly tied to their German co-belligerents and when Barbarossa began to flounder the Soviets turned their ire on the Republic as in the winter War waves of Soviet conscripts broke upon the carillion Isthmus trying to unseat The Finnish Defenders the Finns fought nose to nose with these Soviets but again like the winter War their energy and resources were sapped with every battle while the Soviets called up more and more men and materiel matterheim realized he must surrender corellia and order the troops holding the ismos into a fighting Retreat the Finns withdrew in good order even winning a defensive victory at the bloody Battle of attrition at Tali ihantala in 1944 which placed the idea in Soviet Minds that Finland may be more trouble than it was worth part Stalin was ready to consolidate his forces and drive to Berlin he had bigger borscht to Stew and the fins were equally Keen to reach A Separate Peace with these Soviets there were however 214 000 barriers to A Separate Peace between the Finns and Soviets and they were the men of the German 20th Mountain Army based in The Finnish region of Lapland on September 14 1944 a Finnish delegation headed by foreign minister Carl ankle met with their Soviet counterparts to discuss ending hostilities they were blindsided with demands to cede the petsamo peninsula and for a forced lease of porkala Naval base near Helsinki in addition to these concessions Finland would pay the Soviets the equivalent of 300 million dollars in reparations allow Soviet troops free access to and Passage through their country and arrest a list of war criminals to be Tried by Allied courts allowing the Red Army free reign in the country meant a Soviet occupation was inevitable but the Finns felt they had little choice in the matter and signed the Moscow Armistice five days later the Finns requested the Germans withdrawal from Lapland setting a two-week deadline that the Finns and Germans both knew could not be realistically met just like these Soviets wanted the Moscow Armistice require the fins to use Force against any Germans left in their country after the two weeks had elapsed which would mean war between Finland and Germany that war came on September 28th as the Germans were trying to make the 1100 kilometer or 683 mile Trek from their positions in Lapland to occupied Norway slowed by the size of their force and the small fact that it was the middle of an Arctic winter the Germans could only do so much to adhere to The Finnish deadline the fins for their part delayed to the best of their ability but the Soviets threatened to invade Finland yet again if they did not expel the Germans by force and this time the Soviets would keep the entire country Finnish forces met the Nazi rear guard on the 28th ordering them to surrender before opening fire the Germans resisted fiercely giving the Finns a taste of their own medicine with defensive Works including minefields grenade booby traps and scorched Earth Warfare the Lapland War would last until April of 1945 the end of hostilities on Continental Europe throughout all of this however a terrible Injustice was being carried out behind Finish Lines East corellia a section of land long disputed between Russia and Finland came under occupation by the Finns during the continuation War an occupational government with Finnish nationalist vaina kotilinan at its head Coty linen's government had three aims develop Eastern corellia convince the population to integrate into the Republic of Finland and eliminate foreign enemies many Russians living in the region were rounded up and placed in internment camps the vast majority of the 24 000 interned in these camps were women children and elderly as the men had long ago been called up to fight in the Red Army a bad harvest in 1941 paired with the rough conditions of the camps resulted in the deaths of thousands it is estimated that the death toll for the camps was 18 with Russian sources claiming a toll as high as 33 percent by summer of 1945 the war in Europe had ended Finland though required to seed roughly 10 percent of its land and Lease bases to the Soviets was not occupied Helsinki became the only capital city of a continental combatant to have never been occupied and went into the Cold War an island of Republican democracy in the Warsaw Pact Finland had lost two major Wars since 1939 yet had miraculously kept its independence The Finnish story in the second world war is one of grit determination and a total unwillingness to bow down before powers stronger than oneself but it is also the tale of hatred where nationalists were allowed to try their hand at ethnic cleansing in East corellia the second world war From finland's perspective is a complicated Viewpoint to take one grounded in

the disunified citizens of this young country were the clay from which benito mussolini intended to mold his new roman empire il ducey was determined to craft a fascist state reaching from gibraltar to the parisian gulf and in pursuit of his vision of empire he set about a campaign of military adventures in the lead-up to the second world war that expanded italy's imperial holdings and advanced the fascist cause in europe at their own expense these adventures from the swift annexation of albania to the brutal ethnic cleansing campaign in the deserts of libya were wastes of valuable resources for little gain but of all of italy's military ventures during the interwar period it is the nation's involvement in the colonial war in ethiopia and the spanish civil war that most notably exemplify the unnecessary expenditure of military resources and at times dissent over the unrealistic nature of mussolini's aspirations il ducey had made no secret of his aspiration to conquer ethiopia believing that an imperialist success would unite the country behind him and provide italy with access to the sea unfettered by foreign presence mussolini's minister for colonies emilio de bono received official orders in february 1934 to prepare offensive plans and in december of that same year mussolini publicly ordered the conquest of ethiopia the timing seemed perfect as most european powers were distracted by nazi germany's rearmament however as it spent 1935 preparing for war the italian military's shortcomings became clear marshall pietro bedolio head of the italian high command visited the staging grounds in italian eritrea and returned with a grim opinion italy was completely unprepared for an offensive war and bedolio further warned that a war in ethiopia would prove a potentially fatal financial strain bedolio said as much in a meeting of the high command in september 1934 his warnings were met with absolute indifference an indication of the discord amongst italy's leadership il ducey had long ago decided on invading ethiopia which they did in october of 1935. de bono was put in charge of the invasion and found himself at the head of an army under strength men and materiel were in short supply and progress proved so slow that mussolini replaced de bono with bardolio who remember had been against the invasion under bedolio the italians leveraged their superior weaponry and communications ability to improve the conditions on the ground but ultimately resorted to deploying mustard gas to overcome ethiopian troops and pacify civilians these blatant violations of the geneva convention saw italy placed under economic sanctions which served to drive domestic support for both mussolini and the invasion while italy would declare victory in 1937 they would face continuous insurrection until 1939 before ultimately losing ethiopia to the british in 1941 along with over 200 000 italian soldiers taken prisoner when civil war broke out in spain in 1936 between left-wing republicans and right-wing nationalists il ducey unilaterally committed italy to francisco franco's nationalist cause mussolini intended to use intervention in spain to cement fascist control over the mediterranean with him and franco casting long shadows over the region like germany italy sent the nationalists arms and men but here is where things take a turn so excited to support franco was mussolini that he had more than 70 000 italian soldiers in spain at the peak of his nation's involvement and at times had more aircraft in spain than the spaniards did consisting of one-tenth of the estimated numbers fighting for francisco franco's fascists italy had deployed more soldiers than any other nation in spain on either side of the conflict the italian loss of life was estimated to be around 4 000 soldiers mussolini was exceptionally generous to his fascist ally giving these spaniards more than 600 planes 150 tanks 800 artillery pieces 10 000 machine guns and nearly a quarter million rifles these were men and machinery that italy could ill afford to lose and though the spanish civil war proved a valuable training ground for italian troops the impact of the loss of materiel to spain would last throughout the entire second world war with these pre-war conflicts and their effects on italy understood we must now turn to the key reason italy even had the opportunity to be ineffective in the second world war their relationship to nazi germany although they had a rocky start to their relationship hitler avered his belief that he and mussolini shared the destiny of saving europe from democracy and judeo-bolshevism in 1936 the axis powers were born with the signing of the rome berlin axis united by fascism bitterness over the end of the first world war shared hatred of communists jews and other out groups as well as their determination to conquer both dictators prepared for war against any who would oppose them concluding a military alliance in 1939 this pact of steel mandated that both nazi germany and fascist italy go to war against any nation the other attacked and that they keep constant diplomatic contact to coordinate their efforts hitler kept this promise as well as he'd kept every vow he'd made to the world that is to say he didn't without informing his ally hitler planned the invasions of czechoslovakia and poland even stressing to german high command the importance of attacking before mussolini discovered their plans this subterfuge put mussolini on edge leaving him worried that germany might next begin asserting dominance in the balkans which he regarded as falling within italy's sphere of influence when poland was invaded in 1939 italy was in no position to fight alongside germany mussolini had confided in hitler that italy would not be ready to wage war until 1943 but mussolini feared being absorbed by germany if italy did not take decisive military action and though his advisers stayed his hand at first the imminent fall of france in 1940 gave the duchess his opening thus italy plunged headfirst into a war even the bellicose duche knew she was completely unprepared for the leadership of italy was not imbecillic and knew that they had to quite literally pick their battles better to be the hyena following germany's lion gorging themselves on hitler's kills the surest bet in mid-1940 was on hitler next invading great britain and the soviet union remaining out of matters thanks to the molotov-ribbentrop act besides hitler had promised to help the italian economy fascist italy's achilles heel like their axis partner japan italy was reliant on foreign imports of raw materials imports that were all but cut off during wartime unlike germany who had long prepared for wartime economic self-sufficiency and had a strong industrial base italy was never prepared for a state of autarky and lacked the industrial capabilities and raw materials to compensate for it before the war italy imported 9 million tons of coal to supplement their 1.5 to 4 million tons of domestic production two-thirds of which was brought in by sea when italy entered the war alongside germany a british blockade did away with this seaborne coal and italy had to scramble to increase overland imports and domestic production italy's access to oil was likewise hindered as their previous suppliers the united states iran and the soviet union cut off their sales when war broke out italy found itself reliant on romania to supplement its meager domestic oil production but as the eastern front opened up in 1941 germany monopolized romania's oil and while italy did have access to mammoth stores of raw aluminum their issues in fuel and power generation prevented them from exploiting this key resource to its fullest potential italy barely managed to produce a third of the aluminum that germany did throughout the war the upshot of all of these troubles was a military apparatus without reliable access to fuel and an overtaxed industrial sector prone to utter paralysis italy was already a tiny part of the world's industrial base representing 3 percent of global industrial output compared to germany's 11 this minuscule industrial capability was divided between producing goods for the domestic economy and producing weapons for the entire axis war effort italy produced roughly 21 percent of axis tanks 25 percent of axis fighter aircraft and every type of combat ship needed by the axis for seaborne operations germany relied heavily on italy to build out access convoys in the mediterranean italy a small industrial producer was called upon to not only outfit themselves but to provide additional material for their access partners a proposition they were simply not prepared for compounding these issues were the aimless nature of the italian war effort and the endemic corruption of italian business culture economic planners also completely rejected the idea of a streamlined production line or the standardization of parts instead relying on isolated groups of skilled workers painstakingly handcrafting small batches of largely obsolete weapons at a cripplingly slow pace the problems in industrial production served only to further hinder italy's ability to wage war these production issues were not isolated to small arms production however and were plainly evident in the nation's inability to both manufacture a suitable number of tanks and generate designs that compared equality to both their ally and their foes italian armored forces compared particularly poorly in both doctrine and equipment to their allied counterparts one such example would be the inability of italian industries to produce enough welded or cast armor plating and the mountainous italian terrain discouraged the development of heavily armored vehicles in the first place therefore the most commonly produced tracked vehicle in the italian army was the cairo veloce cv33 tankette a tiny two-man armored vehicle that could be equipped with machine guns anti-tank rifles light cannons or even flamethrowers on paper this was a versatile tank that could be easily built with italy's limited industrial capacity and saw extensive use in italy's colonial territories in practice the cv33 was poetically named casa di morto or dead man's box by its crews who hated the flimsy armor and cramped interior after the war allied observers would comment that the individual components of many italian tanks were well engineered and reliable showcasing a solid grasp of the technology needed for a successful modern vehicle the problem was the total lack of cooperation between companies leading to new ideas being viewed with suspicion and international deals being intentionally sabotaged for fear of competition the single exception was found with the italian air force which successfully replaced their outdated air-cooled engines with licensed daimler-benz liquid-cooled engines in 1940 newer italian fighters like the machi c202 folgray were noted for their excellent handling characteristics and remained competitive until 1943. even after this point the rajani company was able to produce advanced aircraft like the re 2005 sagittario which british aces considered superior to even the spitfire and bf-109 the issue lay within numbers fewer than 60 sagittarius were ever produced as if comparatively subpar equipment were not bad enough these inefficiencies would be compounded by severely strained logistics and inept decision making on the part of italian commanders who were frequently at odds with their leader and each other at the outbreak of war the reija marina the italian navy only had two battleships they had also not significantly incorporated radar and sonar technologies as the royal navy had done which left them effectively blind to enemy approach at night or in poor weather this would become a significant factor in losses of several battles such as the battle of cape madapan where not a single italian ship possessed radar capabilities a notably poor strategic decision was the failure to take advantage of their close position to one of britain's most geographically significant bases malta malta was the only allied base between gibraltar and alexandria and was not reinforced by the british due to their belief that they could not defend it from the raja arenatica the italian air force in the wake of the battle of taranto in november of 1940 when the royal navy disabled much of the italian fleet there italian high commands became reluctant to attempt an amphibious takeover of the islands and opted to rely entirely on the regia aeronautica to bomb the islanders into submission in march 1941 the raid on cape matapan by the royal navy badly damaged the raja marina's only operational modern battleship and sank three cruisers and two destroyers while receiving almost no damage in return hindered by the resistance of their commanders in the wake of taranto and matapan unwillingness to focus their efforts on convoy escorts a lack of cover from the raja aeronautica and perpetual fuel shortages the raja marina failed to take advantage of its potential to cut the mediterranean in half and ensure axis supply lines to north africa meanwhile the invasion of greece which mussolini intended to be a military triumph was in reality a poorly planned assault on a prepared foe the rushed invasion and aforementioned logistical and economic deficiencies hamstrung their efforts and the greeks were soon able to not only halt the italian advance but launch a counter-invasion into italian albania mussolini was forced to pull troops from north africa to reinforce the fronts in greece and albania making these withdrawals in the face of british attacks the italian high command became mono maniacal directing all of their efforts at salvaging the balkan fronts these efforts were undercut by mussolini himself who actively sought to undermine padolo now chief of the italian supreme general staff as he was apprehensive about the marshall's popularity bedolio arguably one of italy's more pragmatic commanders was forced to resign as the scapegoat and replaced by martial hugo cavallaro whose appointment was considered politically motivated and unjust in the eyes of other senior officers the disaster of the greek front only continued from there from october 1940 to may 1941 five times more troops were sent to shore up greece and albania than were dispatched to counter the british in north africa along with 1.3 times more material additionally this meant that the raja marina was more occupied with ferrying men and materiel to albania and the aegean than securing supply lines to north africa italian efforts were not met with much success as the rugged terrain and weather of albania interfered with radio communication leaving them unable to coordinate their forces over long distances when it became clear that italy could not bring the invasion to a successful conclusion on their own germany invaded greece in april of 1941 and the italian high command finally turned their attention back to north africa the north african front serves as a perfect showcase of everything wrong with the way fascist italy ran its military operations the italians invaded egypt through libya in september 1940 and experienced a catastrophic loss only a few months later during britain's first large-scale military operation operation compass during operation compass a commonwealth and free french force numbering no more than 36 000 crushed the italian tenth army a combined italian libyan force of 150 000. presiding over this disaster was martial rodolfo graziani formerly considered one of the best italian generals but gratiani's experience had been earned against italy's many colonial enemies and he was left totally out of his depth when confronted by a modern european army despite a tremendous numerical advantage graziani quickly recognized his largely non-mechanized force could be easily outmaneuvered by the motorized british force and with his supply lines already overstretched he reluctantly decided to dig in and fortify at key defensible positions but these strong points were strung out and incapable of supporting each other so the british simply drove through the gaps and encircled them these tactics enabled the british to use their full force of 36 000 men 275 tanks 120 guns and 60 armored cars against one or two italian positions at a time often finding themselves encircled italian and libyan troops surrendered in their thousands by the end of the operation the british had taken more than 138 000 prisoners hundreds of tanks thousands of guns and numerous aircraft whilst sustaining a few losses by comparison the italian's fortunes were briefly reversed by hitler who sent the newly formed africa corps under irwin rommel to bail mussolini out the german intervention and subsequent moment of triumph before the axis was eventually driven back to sicily served to further highlight the italians deficiencies in both leadership and logistics german forces comprised the minority of total forces throughout the entire north african campaign showing that the insertion of capable german leadership played a key difference in the performance of the italian army tactical prowess and a few german panzers can't solve logistical issues however and so the north african campaign was in many ways doomed from the start additionally italian disunity at home and misfortune in the field did not breed a strong fighting spirit in the italians as a whole while many germans were convinced of the righteousness of their cause the italian's loyalty to home over nation and skepticism of central government prevented them from widely accepting such ideas this coupled with their string of military embarrassments set the stage for the rapid italian surrender before the end of the war unlike every other major power involved in the second world war italy threw in the towel long before its capital was directly threatened londoners endured the blitz the chinese even after nan king fell the germans down to the rubble of berlin and the russians even at the gates of moscow the people of italy however were not so inclined to see their home destroyed to uphold their fascist government when the united states and britain invaded sicily in july of 1943 the writing was on the wall for il ducey july 25th saw mussolini stripped of military command and the next day he was formally dismissed as prime minister before being imprisoned italy's military misfortune under mussolini was not simply the result of incompetence but of a lack of preparation economic pressures inferior weaponry and feuding officers and bureaucrats to reduce fascist italy to the comic relief of the axis powers forgets that they desired the conquest and stood for the same evils as nazi germany they just weren't as unified as a force and thus unable to enact their villainy on as large a scale as their ideological ally [Music] you\",\n",

griffin johnson the armchair historian as chill autumn winds began blowing across the battlefields of europe over 230 000 allied soldiers crept toward the ancient city of achen strategically achen was of minimal significance a stop along one of the four main roads leading to germany's industrial heartland hardly a natural fortress this city sat in a depression surrounded by hills and most of its defenses were provided by two parallel belts of the west wall yet in addition to being the very first ethnically german city besieged by the allies achen had once been the capital city of adolf hitler's beloved first reich known by more rational historians as the holy roman empire naturally any threat to this symbolic city called for a fanatical response and hitler was ready to commit all available forces to its defense during the second world war the information war was fought just as fiercely for territory and resources agencies on both sides sought to crack codes sabotage operations

governors of achen had taken one look at the onrushing allied armies and promptly abandoned the civilian population to its fate infuriated by this display of cowardice hitler had the officials arrested by the ss and shipped off to the eastern front by the time general gerhart von schwarin dragged the shattered remnants of his 116th panzer division through the city he found it full of thousands of terrified civilians and a ragtag collection of volksderm militia knowing a lost cause when he saw one von schwerin paused just long enough to leave a letter at the post office designating achen as an open city for the incoming allied forces the deeply unlucky general then ran head first into orders coming the other direction telling him to turn his division around and return to the city for a last stand naturally he had been gone just long enough for a sharp-eyed shustoffel to have found the letter and he was promptly relieved of command defense of the sector now fell on the shoulders of lieutenant general friedrich j cockling's 81st corps consisting mainly of two volks grenadier and two infantry divisions while the germans scrambled to put together a viable strategy the three army corps of the american first army under general courtney h hodges crept closer and closer despite the apparently tenuous nature of the german defenses nobody was under any illusions about the meat grinder that lay ahead sergeant harley reynolds of the bloody first division described the mood thusly i can remember the talk and comments about the city of akhen that no way would the germans give up this city without a fight to the last german standing we talked about this among the ranks i felt there was a good chance that they would possibly drive us back with a big counter-attack we were a finger sticking out in front of the us line a very dangerous position surprisingly enough the initial skirmishes that took place as the first army moved to breach the west wall around achen in early september proceeded with minimal casualties while three infantry regiments pushed through the forest to the west side of the city two armored regiments began a flanking attack towards the town of stolberg at first the attackers were daunted by the sheer scale of the defensive works they encountered hundreds of pill boxes and dozens of bunkers with overlapping fields of fire overlooking extensive minefields and concrete anti-tank obstacles yet resistance was light as the eastern front was still occupying the majority of german manpower leaving only a scattering of exhausted veterans and walking wounded to man a network of defenses originally intended to be garrisoned by entire armies unfortunately general courtney's swift progress was ground to an abrupt halt by factors beyond his control granting the germans the critical break they needed to get their act together the allied supply situation had been shaky at best since the enormity landings and it would not improve for the boys near achen as september rolled in the planners of operation market garden which occurred at about the same time seemingly did their best to waste as much fuel ammunition and manpower as possible in their abortive attempt to breach german lines in the netherlands having been bumped far down the priority list the men of the first army trudged onwards trying to make best use of the good weather whilst their supplies dwindled on the 22nd of september the same day operation market garden ended the 16th infantry regiment was on the verge of capturing the town of islanddorf just south of achen when they abruptly came under massive artillery fire as the smoke cleared the german 12th infantry division arrived to politely inform the allies that the good times were over and the real fight had just begun though few in number the professional soldiers of the 12th had been supplemented by a swarm of volksderm militia and traumatized americans later recalled the sight of women and children fighting with pistols knives and even panzerfaust anti-tank weapons one commander reported that the germans had simply gone mad and are bent on destroying themselves the americans were able to hold their positions during the savage engagement but were prevented from advancing just long enough for heavy cloud cover to descend over the region eliminating the possibility of close air support now experiencing major shortages of fuel heavy munitions and spare parts for armored vehicles the frustrated men of the first army were forced to halt all offensive operations until the first week of october during this critical period lieutenant general cockling's 81st corps was heavily reinforced the exact number of german soldiers committed to the battle is impossible to determine but by the 2nd of october around 24 000 raw recruits traumatized veterans ss fanatics and terrified volksterm stood ready to give their lives to defend the capital of the actual thousand-year reich together they huddled in their bunkers and pillboxes as the allies saturated the region with artillery fire and bombing raids between september 27th and october 2nd after which the ground offensive resumed having now partially enveloped achen the first army sought to break through german lines in the north to encircle the old capital completely sadly for the americans the west wall absorbed the bombardment with barely a scratch forcing the infantry to begin the incredible laborious process of dislodging the defenders one fortification at a time in the town of uba palenburg gis engaged in brutal urban warfare with the german defenders which often devolved into both sides flinging grenades at each other until entire neighborhoods were reduced to rubble with most of the bridges in the region having been destroyed american armored forces were constantly delayed by river crossings and were unable to provide support for the infantry by the end of just the first day of fighting the leading american 117th infantry battalion had lost 146 men another battalion had 58 wounded and 12 dead over 50 pillboxes had been destroyed or captured but hundreds still lay between the first army and victory in the sector over the next few days the vicious urban warfare intensified and gis quickly learned to approach enemy pillboxes only if flamethrowers or demolition charges were available defenders were roasted in their concrete shells or blasted into ruin by tanks and self-propelled guns but rarely chose to surrender all the wild german reinforcements raced into the sector including the elite first ss panzer division by the 7th of october the allies had successfully secured the area around ubach palembeg and pushed southwards as far as alsdorf but had yet to enter achen itself which was now home to about 000 enemy troops instead fighting was concentrated around the suburbs with the 26th infantry division led by lieutenant colonel daryl m daniel slowly clawing a foothold out of the ratha erda district once this area was secured plans were made for the regiment to push north into the heart of the city [Music] in an effort to avert a bloodbath lieutenant general clarence r heubner of the first infantry division sent an ultimatum to the commander of german forces in achen colonel gerhart vilk on october 10th in his letter hubner demanded the city surrender or be bombed to oblivion but achen was now fully in the grip of the ss who were quite ready to execute any soldier who showed even a hint of cowardice beyond this fear of capital punishment the soldiers defending the aachen section of the west wall knew that they were now fighting to protect the very heartland of germany as a result the offer was rejected and colonel vilk assumed full responsibility for the defense after establishing his headquarters in the north side of the city the 11th of october saw a shift in ally tactics with their supply situation stabilizing mass artillery bombardment commenced on achen and the surrounding german-held townships tired of the bloody street fighting the americans were ready to simply level every building that could feasibly hold enemy combatants this forced the germans onto the offensive but their efforts to reclaim the high ground surrounding achen all ended in failure by this point the picturesque city had been subjected to an on and off bombardment for weeks as well as numerous air raids but the gothic architecture had proven surprisingly resilient with the majority of the first infantry division holding off german counter-attacks two battalions of the 26th infantry regiment began to move through the industrial district between rafaela and the suburb of hagen their objectives were three hills dominating aachen's northern quarter which contained the bulk of the 246th volks grenadiers and colonel villex headquarters by the 12th the 2nd and 3rd battalions had managed to clear out the industrial district and were ready to enter the narrow twisted maze of streets that made up the inner city knowing that massing his troops would lead to a slaughter colonel daniel split up his men into assault platoons assigning a single m4 sherman or self-propelled gun to each unit upon seeing the massive stone structures at the heart of the city daniels issued simple instructions knock them all down despite letting their artillery rain fire over ten thousand shells prior to the main assault the first american soldiers to set foot in achen were still breeded with a hail of machine gun fire forcing them to scramble for cover in the imposing stone buildings that lined the narrow streets here they were ambushed by wild-eyed volkster who sprung from hidden basements and cellars to engage the gis in hand-to-hand combat the tanks fared little better being at the mercy of hidden anti-tank guns and lone german soldiers armed with panzerfausts or sticky grenades once again the attackers were forced to go room by room checking for germans waiting to ambush them the instant their backs were turned as they crawled closer to their objectives 2nd battalion was confronted by increasingly tough fortifications including hardened air raid shelters improvising colonel john t corley ordered an m12 155 millimeter gun mortar carriage to lumber through the streets the exposed crew no doubt ducking at every shadow as they wheeled into position to blast holes in enemy strongholds at point-blank range delighted with the results of the attack corley rewarded the m12's crew by informing them they would be staying with his men as they advanced deeper into the city the rest of the day was spent advancing towards observatory hill so named for the observation tower built upon its nearly 900-foot tall crescent by the end of the 13th 3rd battalion had managed to reach the base of one of these three hills they had been assigned to capture prompting colonel vilk to request reinforcements from the german divisions still counter-attacking to the east thanks to the dense urban terrain several hundred troops and at least a half dozen assault guns slipped through the tenuous allied line the next day they were just in time to engage colonel corley's men as they attacked vilk's headquarters at farwick park where an intense battle raged until the early evening but as corley prepared to renew his advance he was countermanded by colonel huebner the forces outside achen had launched another attack tying up all available reserves for over 24 hours general kochling's 81st corps battered the beleaguered first division until both sides were utterly exhausted but aided by artillery and air support the americans were able to dig in and weather the assault then strike back at the collapsing german line with a decisive blow finally the jaws of the allied pincer movement were able to slam shut completely encircling achen and leaving colonel vilk isolated from further reinforcements their eastern flank now secure the first army was able to take its time mopping up the remaining germans in achen on the 18th 2nd battalion resumed its attack on farwick park driving the defenders into the basement with an artillery barrage before sending assault squads in to secure the kvelenhof hotel though colonel vilk had already left the hotel the defenders put up a tremendous fight hurling grenades from every entrance and forcing gis back in the end colonel corley had to threaten to demolish the entire structure before the germans finally agreed to surrender the loss of farwick park was a death blow to the german resistance in achen and not even a written order from colonel vilk encouraging his troops to fight to the last man inspired much determination with huge swathes of the city now under american control the survivors of the 246th volks grenadiers were hemmed in on their remaining hilltops with observatory hill falling to the 2nd battalion on the 19th by now achen was little more than a mound of rebel as the americans systematically demolished any building that could even potentially harbor enemy combatants with essentially no ground left to go colonel vilk was finally cornered in an air raid shelter on the 20th as corley wheeled his favorite 155 millimeter gun into position outside the fortress vilk realized the game was up and dispatched several american pows to carry a message of surrender to the besiegers [Music] the battle of achen represented one of the worst periods of urban fighting in american history with the first army sustaining as many as 8 000 casualties during its breach of the west wall and battle for the city compared to the 2400 suffered during the landing on omaha beach popularly considered the bloodiest fight for the us in europe german losses amounted to roughly six thousand dead and over five thousand prisoners taken perhaps the saddest aspect of the fighting was its overall futility in trying to defend a precious symbol of nazi ideology adolf hitler had squandered thousands of lives and caused the utter destruction of charlemagne's ancient capital meanwhile the americans would ultimately fail to exploit their victory in any meaningful way instead turning south to try and cut through the hercenvald this gigantic forest would prove every bit the defender's paradise as had ahen's narrow streets and stone architecture stalling the first army until february of 1945. historians now remember the battle of achen as just one more example of how germany's stubborn refusal to surrender resulted in a pointless waste of life and the destruction of a beautiful city that had stood intact for well over a thousand years [Music] you\",\n",

turrets but these weapons were unable to fire directly forwards without destroying the propeller of the plane carrying them enter the focker eindecker in 1915 an otherwise unremarkable monoplane turned Terror of the Skies via the introduction of a cowl mounted 7.92 millimeter machine gun with a trigger mechanism synchronized with the rotation of the propeller this tiny monoplane would be credited with over a thousand kills during the Great War and started the focker scourge where eindeckers dominated these Skies over Europe for months on end by early 1916 antaunt biplanes with their own synchronized guns were emerging to put an end to the focker scourge this allowed the albatross company to step in and pick up the slack with their Albatross D series which featured improved aerodynamic fuselages and twin machine guns hundreds were produced with the design being incrementally improved right up until the end of the war it was in this aircraft that Manfred von Richthofen earned the title of Red Baron and was the first one to sport his signature scarlet color scheme while the eindecker was a crew designed with a single Innovation focker's own D4 biplane was a Cutting Edge machine that raced off the production line after testing by the Red Baron himself [Music] although only used for 10 months before the end of the war the D4 amassed such a reputation that the Anton Powers demanded the entire surviving stock as War prizes after the armistice surprisingly enough the Red Baron himself did not fly a focker D4 during the remainder of the war but instead used a focker dr-1 triplane as his personal aircraft with its triple Wing Arrangement the dry Decker could outturn and outclimb most contemporary opponents but was inferior in many other aspects due to the added drag and extra mass of the third wing between 1914 and 1916 Germany made extensive use of its large Zeppelin Fleet to conduct aerial reconnaissance and strategic bombing raids across the English Channel contrary to popular perception Zeppelins were virtually immune to Conventional ammunition and often limped home with gas bags perforated by thousands of rounds this all changed with the introduction of incendiary bullets turning the entire remaining Fleet into floating target practice for the Anton to replace its now obsolete Zeppelins the Central Powers invested in the first long-range bombers produced primarily by the gotha company carrying 1500 pounds of Ordnance the gotha series was the Flying Fortress of the biplane era easily able to defend itself with up to three turret-mounted machine guns in 1934 the German air Ministry embarked on a program to replace its Fleet of Aging biplanes with a modernized all-metal monoplane with an enclosed cockpit German Engineers Walter rethel and Billy Messerschmitt Rose to the challenge competing against much more well-established companies to produce the bf-109 Prototype within just one year the design was Battle tested in 1937 when examples were flown by the luftwaffe Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War where it utterly dominated the competition despite only being armed with a pair of 7.92 machine guns giddy with success Master Schmidt began a series of Rapid iterations on the original design resulting in the e or Emil model airframe that entered the Second World War this model introduced the ability to carry small bombs for ground support but also offered a huge upgrade in Firepower thanks to the installation of two 20 millimeter cannons in the wings by now many fighters were resistant to light machine gun fire with organizations like the RAF assuming a minimum of 300 rounds would be needed to down most aircraft meanwhile a well-aimed 20 millimeter high explosive projectile could blow the wing clean off any fighter in one shot quickly following the Emil 1941 saw the Friedrich variant of the 109 take flight into the skies across Europe fitted with a more powerful engine a streamlined fuselage and rounded Wings the F-series was a superb jack of all trades design competitive with any contemporary fighter the F-series also removed the wing mounted guns replacing them with single 20 millimeter cannon firing through the propeller hub still the ever-evolving nature of War meant that newer versions just had to be produced and in 1942 the bf-109g or Gustav rolled off of the production line the most successful and prolific version of the 109 the Gustav had an amazing 16 variants and fought in every major theater of the war from 1942 all the way up to 1945. the final iteration on messerschmidt's legendary design was the 109k or Kerr first only appearing after January of 1945 the kerfirst pushed its delicate chassis to the Limit thanks to an engine capable of producing up to 2 000 horsepower this final iteration was a match for any Allied fighter But ultimately far too few were produced to affect the outcome of the war the breakout success of the 109 did not discourage competition from other German manufacturers engineer Kurt Voldemort tank of the fockovolf company quickly realized that it was pointless trying to build a similar fighter as it would only cause competition for The Limited supply of Daimler Ben's inline engines that most Fighters used at the time his prototype fw-190 instead used a radial engine that was easier to manufacture and maintain in addition to a solid durable airframe the 190 A1 featured two 20 millimeter cannons and four 7.92 machine guns after serving well during the opening stages of the war the 190 received extensive upgrades resulting in the Fearsome A4 model commonly known as the Virgo or butcher bird now with four cannons the A4 could disintegrate any Allied fighter with one click of the trigger and was also known for its incredible roll rate dive speed and vertical maneuvering ability by 1944 Allied high altitude bombers were busy pounding German infrastructure to rubble and the fockovolf 190 was one of the airframes redesigned to counter this threat the new d-series replaced the radial engine with a turbocharged inline engine optimized for high altitude flight this gave the fw-190 a near unparalleled climb rate and service ceiling of nearly 40 000 feet or 12 000 meters despite its capabilities the D series was soon reassigned to more standard fighter interception and even ground attack roles as the luftwaffa began introducing jet fighters to its lineup towards the end of the war many older radial engine 190s were refitted as ground attackers ensuring the 190 remained useful until the very end of the war another famous Workhorse of the Third Reich was the ju-87 a robust goal-winged aircraft fitted with dive brakes that made it one of the world's first true dive bombers first tested in the mid-1930s the Stuka would be deployed alongside the 109 by the Condor Legion where it immediately excelled in its intended role following the outbreak of war in Europe The ju-87b Struck morbid Terror into the hearts of infantry across Poland and France thanks to its iconic Sirens but these were actually only used for a brief period of time due to the amount of drag they added to the airframe while dozens of ju-87 variants were made the most interesting is the ju-87g also known as the Kanon forward or Cannon bird which featured two underslung 37 millimeter anti-tank cannons though horribly slow and ungainly the improvised design was a fearsome ground attack aircraft allowing Stuka Aces like Hans Ulrich Rudolph to amass dozens of kills on the Eastern Front while best known for the 109 Master Schmidt produced many other designs during the second world war among these was the bf-110 xerstorer or Destroyer a twin-engined heavy fighter the bf-110 stands out as perhaps one of the most misused aircraft in the war being forced into the role of a bomber escort during the Battle of Britain where it proved easy prey for single engine Fighters the 110 chassis did prove very adaptable however and during the later stages of the war the g-series would operate as capable bomber interceptors even mounting 37 millimeter cannons and radar arrays for Knight combat another fascinating modification were the shriga music vertical cannons fitted in the canopies of Select 110 genes these allow the craft to cruise directly below enemy bombers and fire up at them from much lower altitudes while German aircraft needed guns to have a major impact on the battlefield the tiny fiesler fi-156 storage or stork was a lightweight Scout plane that performed many vital roles during the war such as transporting commanders between sectors spotting for artillery batteries and even deploying paratrooper squads with the ability to take off with less than 50 meters of Runway the 156 could operate anywhere in just about any condition deposed Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was rescued from the grand Sasso Mountaintop using a stork and captured examples were so popular with the Allies that field Marshal Bernard Montgomery used one as a personal transport plane the Workhorse of the luftwaffa was the simple ju-52 a versatile cargo plane that first took flight in 1930 and would go on to outlive the Nazi cause by more than 30 years though sometimes armed with a few light machine guns for emergencies the ju-52 was more noteworthy for its unusual tri-motor engine configuration and Innovative features such as the early autopilot system and rugged skin of corrugated door lumen Hitler's personal transport was a modified j-52 and the sturdy airframe made it an ideal choice for paratrooper operations being able to hold up to 18 soldiers and their equipment the one critical weakness of the German air force lay in its total lack of heavy strategic bombers instead the most common German bomber was the heinkel 111 a pre-war design initially built as a civilian airliner but deliberately made for easy conversion to military service the 111 served well in massed bomber formations over Poland and France but quickly proved inadequate during the Battle of Britain while able to carry a versatile payload the 111 never had more than a few machine guns for a point defense and was much too slow to outrun enemy Fighters sharply limiting its potential effectiveness this is not to say Germany lacked effective bombers as the dornier 217 series would-handedly demonstrate with a solid airframe powerful engines and similar profile to the bf-110 the 217 was another design that could do just about anything the luftwaffe needed it to though first used as a reconnaissance plane the do217k was modified with a large internal Bombay that could be filled with regular Ordnance or hold the advanced Fritz X guided bomb other variants could even deploy the hentral hs-293 guided anti-ship missile technically making it one of the first missile armed planes in history in a further effort to fill the Strategic bomber-sized Gap in their Air Force the luftwaffe commissioned the heinkel 177 in 1942. this ambitious design featured four twin-linked engines in two nacellas and remote controlled gun turrets with a maximum payload of nearly 16 000 pounds the he-177 compared quite favorably to the American B-17 Flying Fortress in most aspects and over a thousand were produced unfortunately the highly experimental airframe and convoluted engine layout was an absolute maintenance Nightmare and in combination with severe fuel shortages this meant that most of the he-177 fleet never saw action as the war dragged on and the balance of power tipped against the axis German Engineers began desperately Searching For A Miracle Solution experiments with jet engines had been going on since 1942 and in mid-1944 the first ever jet fighter took flight in the form of the me-262 known as the schwalba or swallow the 262 A1 used two junkers yumo axial flow turbojet engines to reach speeds of up to 530 miles or 850 kilometers per hour initially armed with four 30 millimeter cannons the 262 could also carry bombs and Rockets this aircraft excelled in the role of bomber Hunter but ironically the Primitive jet engines lacked the acceleration or maneuverability of prop aircraft and several of these Cutting Edge Fighters were shot down when their pilots foolishly chose to dogfight much more Nimble Allied aircraft that they could have easily outrun while the 262 was successful it was also expensive complex and very maintenance intensive the heinkel company's volkswager or people's fighter offered a more economical alternative using a single BMW turbojet mounted on a tiny wooden frame armed with two 20 or 30 millimeter cannons depending on the variant this tiny fighter displayed many Innovative characteristics like its streamlined airframe and experimental ejection system but came far too late in the war to have any appreciable impact in 1957 the West German air force officially requested that NATO provide them with a modern fighter aircraft prompting Lockheed Martin to produce a special redesign of its f-104 Starfighter just for the luftwaffe though enthusiastically dumped the super Starfighter due to its improved engine uptuned avionics and enhanced payload the f-104g was quickly given a much less flattering moniker by its Pilots vit venmacher AKA Widowmaker a ridiculous 292 out of nearly 1 000 aircraft would be lost to crashes killing 116 Pilots although the cause of This Disaster was eventually identified as issues with pilot training on supersonic aircraft the luftwaffe began seeking a replacement as early as the 1960s by the late 1960s companies like heiko and Messerschmitt had rebuilt enough to start regular collaboration with other NATO engineering firms in 1969 the United Kingdom Germany Italy and the Netherlands created an international company with the sole duty of producing new multi-role jet aircraft utilizing variable geometry Wings the result was the panavia tornado introduced in 1979 and still in active service today tornadoes conducted the first German offensive air operation since the second world war being part of the NATO intervention in the Kosovo war in 1999. the considerable success of the tornado prompted further collaboration between the various NATO powers work began on another multi-role aircraft this time with an advanced Canard delta wing airframe the long and complicated project was further hampered by the economic upheaval caused by the reunification of Germany in 1990 but eventually resulted in a Euro Fighter typhoon which made its first flight in 2003. 2003 also saw the introduction of the Eurocopter tiger an advanced attack helicopter whose design requirements were based on the Cold War demand for anti-tank helicopters to combat the threat of a Soviet armored invasion of Europe designed in collaboration with the French the tiger was the first European helicopter to have a chassis built purely from radar absorbent composite materials considered a major success the Tiger has so far seen combat in Libya Mali and Afghanistan under both French and German operators special thanks again to hunting Clash for sponsoring this video Start

control of the german military which he finally achieved in 1938 two manufactured scandals collectively known as the blomberg fritch affair led to the removal of war minister verner von blamberg and commander-in-chief werner von fritsch from their posts this allowed for hitler to take over as commander-in-chief of the armed forces and restructure the ministry of war into the uber commando der vermasht or okw hitler appointed wilhelm keitel a man quickly won over to the fuhrer as chief of okw's general staff and made alfred yodel another loyalist head of the wfst or operation staff these men particularly kaidel functioned as little more than mouthpieces for adolf hitler a means to ensure his hold on the military was absolute beneath yodel and kaidal the okw was split into three main branches the okh army high command initially led by army commander-in-chief walter von brauj the okm commander of the navy led by naval commander-in-chief and grand admiral eric raider and the okl commander of the air force headed by its air force commander-in-chief hermann goering these branches all reported to the okw on operational matters but aside from semi-regular interventions by adolf hitler himself their leaders avoided joint consultation and operated more or less independently the structure of the military hierarchy became even more disjointed in 1940 with the introduction of the waffen-ss as an independent fourth branch of the armed services that answered only to hitler under die hard nazi heinrich himmler the ss operated with a separate budget administration training centers uniform and rank system assigned to support the vermost in the field ss units tended to operate without the approval or even knowledge of the okw disconnected though they were all branches of the german military under the nazis were united by one thing complete subservience to the will of adolf hitler while certainly not omnipotent in his dealings with the military it is impossible to deny the overbearing influence this one man had on the destiny of his self-proclaimed reich while not as incompetent as many have since depicted him hitler possessed a set of ideals that resulted in many of his decisions not being entirely guided by careful calculated assessments of the situation at hand rather he was driven by his beliefs namely that his so-called aryan race was superior to all others after their incredible victory in france this view spread throughout the high command confirming in the minds of hitler and his inner circle that they were unstoppable and that nazism was the key to achieving total victory this conviction was unshakable and behind every order hitler gave in his time as fearer lay a certainty that if his people simply held firm and followed his orders they could not possibly be defeated contrary to the post-war grumbling of many prominent generals germany's military elites were all more than happy to fall in line with the nazi regime even before later victories lent hitler's ideas a veneer of legitimacy many of these men shared the nazi's goals others were bought with lavish gifts of cash land and tax exemptions and others feared the anger of the people if they went against the leader who had secured their complete devotion in other words whether out of genuine devotion mutual benefit bribery or fear all but a handful of germany's military leaders were fully committed to the nazi vision of a thousand-year reich for all their later claims of discontent and unwilling cooperation with madman hitler many of his generals stuck by him all the way through the war right up until the reich started to collapse around them [Music] [Music] the most defining features of nazi germany's military leadership stemmed for better and for worse from the fact that ultimate authority over all operations rested on a single man regardless of any strategic assessments logistical concerns or consensus among his advisors adolf hitler could make any decision he wanted about the course of the war and everyone else would simply have to obey at the best of times this meant that the labyrinthine military bureaucracy could be bypassed with the stroke of the fuhrer's pen sweeping changes in doctrine tactics and equipment could be implemented instantly letting the vermost adapt to new circumstances with breathtaking speed this stood in stark contrast to the allied forces who often had to put up with months of committee meetings field tests and observational trials before implementing even the smallest innovations on the other hand this system encouraged officers to bitterly compete with each other for power and prestige as whoever could catch hitler's ear at a crucial moment would usually receive preferential treatment this extreme inter-service rivalry inevitably resulted in germany's resources being squandered on feudal wonder weapon projects or simply hoarded by one branch of the military for the sake of denying them to the competition this is not to say that the high command made nothing but snap decisions based on personal intuition far from it hitler's vermosh inherited a tradition of military philosophy and command structures going back to the 19th century later refined through the interwar period through weimar reformists like hans von say one of these strategic traditions the most innovative and important was kriegspiela or wargames a series of planning exercises aimed at examining the strengths and weaknesses of every player active in the field of war alongside these laborious planning stages the decentralized nature of german tactical command worked most to their advantage during the early stages of the war thanks to the philosophy of offstrack tactic or mission type tactics this approach emphasized that it was the outcome of a mission that mattered most not the individual steps to accomplish it field commanders were given great autonomy to take objectives plan offensives and direct the flow of battle without needing to run every decision up the chain of command this mythology allowed axis field commanders the freedom to make snap decisions and react dynamically to the evolving situation while enemy officers were still waiting to be acknowledged by their seniors the invasion of france was perhaps the quintessential example of mission type tactics in action proceeding so quickly that the 7th panzer division was completely unreachable led by irwin rommel this armored division moved so swiftly and independently that neither their enemies nor their superiors could locate them earning the unit the nickname ghost division meanwhile the strategic picture was further muddled by the actions of the ss who were deployed to pursue their own objectives only sometimes in connection to the rest of the army but as high command struggled to keep up with the situation the men on the ground were busy taking the principles of auftrak tactique to heart led by veterans of the great war the vermont was able to engage in a series of stunning offensive maneuvers that caught their enemies completely off guard astonishingly field officers managed to organize a coherent strategy of rapid combined arms warfare more or less on the fly using military theories and concepts that had formally existed only as thought exercises or at best small-scale experiments during the invasions of poland and czechoslovakia such improvisation would have caused the immediate disintegration of any other army in europe but the highly disciplined and motivated german soldiers maintained implicit trust in their leaders even when supplies were running short and seemingly insurmountable odds lay before them unfortunately for germany the tactical genius displayed by officers in the field only really served to compensate for the deeply dysfunctional structure of the okw instead of learning from their successes and forging closer ties in the face of adversity senior officers became more and more obsessed with hoarding power and influence for themselves with hitler able to appoint and dismiss officers entirely at his own discretion job stability within the third reich was non-existent incentivizing bitter inter-service rivalries in essence the german system was best at producing lone wolf officers men who could confidently tackle any assignment but who refused to set aside their differences to take down larger prey in contrast to the chaos which would later come german strategists had ample time before the war to plan for their first invasions and this thoroughness swiftly dismembered the czechoslovakian and polish states in the latter campaign the strategy of spreading german forces across the polish borders to achieve a pincer maneuver proved extremely effective but it required taking extreme risks that conventional military wisdom would have deemed unacceptable general eric von manstein later wrote of the superior discipline and fighting spirit of the german soldiers but also acknowledged that much of the invasion's unexpected success came in part to the loser's own mistakes and above all as a result of the complete inaction of poland's western allies at the time of her defeat though the okw had hoped for a period of calm to analyze the reports of the polish campaign hitler's announcement of the imminent invasion of france threw everything into a frenzy during the months that followed okh officers went back and forth with hitler and among themselves to try and form a cohesive plan to invade france the strategy which emerged known as falgelb called for the main assault into northern belgium through the netherlands engaging anglo-french forces across a long front unbeknownst to the germans this attack was exactly what the allies were preparing for their defensive strategy at the time known as the dial plan was designed to push back a traditional invasion through northern belgium by erecting a strong defensive line from givet to antwerp along the mews and dial rivers keenly aware of fall gelb's weaknesses general heinz guderian and eric von manstein engaged in a bitter feud with its chief proponent the much more conservative and restrained garrett van roensten guderian later wrote the situation became even tenser when it became clear that not even colonel general von roonstedt had any clear idea about the potentialities of tanks and declared himself in favor of the more cautious solution now is the time when we needed a manstein what saved the germans was perhaps a stroke of luck on january 10 1940 a german aircraft carrying details of fall gelb crashed in belgium this crash later known as the mekolin incident gave the allies crucial intelligence about the german plans and consequently forced hitler and his generals to reconsider fall gelb at this crucial turning point general manstein convinced the fuhrer to adopt his plan for the invasion drive an armored spearhead through the ardennes forest in the south as the main assault while distracting the allies with a secondary attack in the north the manstein plan relying on more modern tactics than its predecessor was a shocking success leading to the capitulation of france in only six weeks the germans followed up their conquest of france with a series of quick decisive victories in the balkans rapidly toppling yugoslavia and greece from the outside the nazi war machine seemed like an unstoppable juggernaut executing its operations with perfect discipline and efficiency peeling back the curtain however reveals a more complicated state of affairs the balkans campaign was a success but these strategists in the general staff were flying by the seat of their pants through most of the operations and major strategic decisions continued to be made on the basis of whichever scheme hitler could be persuaded of at a given time this almost felt disaster in crete where the luftwaffe attempted a mass paratrooper landing that nearly cost them an entire airborne division this highlighted a critical weakness in the nazi organizational structure as they had no way of assessing the merits of new unorthodox tactics except by implementing them on the battlefield however it was on the eastern front that the disjointed and competitive nature of the german high command started to cost them dearly operation barbarossa was wildly successful at first but the lack of communication between the branches of the military caused immediate logistical problems not helped by hitler's constant micromanagement which had begun to alienate his commanders in the field then as soon as the mighty lightning assault faltered hitler began seeking out scapegoats laying the blame on the old guard officers who were not fully subservient to him and his ideology he fired browhich after the general's stress-induced heart attack replacing him as head of the okh then proceeded on a spree of forced retirements and dismissals by the beginning of 1942 over 30 generals core and division commanders and senior officers were removed from command the leaders who had won so many victories largely through their own skill and determination in the absence of communication from high command were gone those who remained became increasingly reluctant to bring bad news to the fuhrer or contradict him in any way instead the generals operating along the eastern front began increasingly over-promising on what their depleted units could still achieve still hoping to earn a greater portion of the army's rapidly dwindling resources this trend spelled disaster nowhere more so than at stalingrad logistical failures and a lack of coordination plagued the assaulting forces all while those at the top stubbornly insisted that total victory was just around the corner general hans yeshconnect one of the senior officers of the okl assured hitler that the luftwaffe could keep the troops trapped in stalingrad supplied despite their complete inability to do so general manstein also strongly urged the fuhrer not to order the encircled sixth army to break out insisting he could break through these soviet lines with his own men and relieve stalingrad however such a feat was wholly beyond his capabilities by that point and the forces in stalingrad were abandoned with their loss went any hope of victory on the eastern front by 1944 the writing was on the wall for nazi germany fooled by allied misdirection campaigns the german leaders failed to foresee or adequately defend against the normandy landings with a new western front opened and the eastern front close to collapsing there was not much anyone could have done to turn the tides meanwhile hitler continued to tighten his grip on the military even further after a failed assassination attempt on july 20th over 7 000 suspected collaborators were arrested and nearly 4 500 were executed there was almost nobody left at this point who could go against the increasingly erratic whims of adolf hitler he ordered scorched earth tactics to deny the allies the chance to resupply and launched a series of hopeless counter-attacks in a desperate effort to secure a separate peace with the western allies the endless string of failures and disappointments that followed were blamed on those senior officers who remained many of these men including field marshals gunther von kluge and erwin rummel chose to take their own lives rather than face disgrace and execution at their leader's hands by 1945 when the german military was disintegrating entirely most remaining officers began to abandon the sinking ship many moved to save their ill-gotten fortunes shifting the cash that had bought their loyalty for so long out of german banks and into hidden vaults the few shreds of okw that remained took it upon themselves to coordinate their troops retreat so that as few men as possible wound up in soviet hands hitler remained fanatical and defiant until the end but by this point there was no germany left to carry out his orders when hitler ended his own life on april 30th it fell to the former head of naval high command admiral carl donates to negotiate the unconditional surrender of germany this was a fitting end for a military leadership that was marred by infighting and miscommunication from start to finish with a man at the top who alternated between obsessively controlling all facets of the military and passively endorsing whichever of his bickering advisors caught his attention alongside a fragmented high command rarely capable of working together [Music] you\",\n",

democracy [Music] hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian territorial disputes have been a constant throughout history but few land squabbles have the longevity of the dispute over the falkland islands or las islas malvinas the islands have long been claimed by argentina but were ultimately settled by the british whose colonists live there to this day this is despite argentina's multiple attempts to assert their claim to las malvinas diplomatically arguably with the backing of the united nations legal precedent after a near century of diplomatic effort and british provocation

history vpn before we discuss the fight for the islands it is important to understand where this conflict originates in the first place the dispute over las malvinas first played out in the halls of international diplomacy as the british settled and expanded across the islands the argentines protested their presence reiterating their claim from 1820 and citing the settlement of the island by argentine gauchos or ranchers before the british incursion the argentine case is rooted in these twin facts and the central thesis that the british illegally occupy sovereign argentine territory these subsequent votes by the falkland islanders to remain british thus have no legal standing while the falklanders claim their right to self-determination the argentines point to a u.n resolution that places territorial integrity over self-determination in short this u.n ruling guarantees argentina's claim to las malvinas under the color of international law no matter how many times the british colonists vote to continue their occupation after all would the mosquito vote for citronella speaking of the u.n the international body took notice of argentina's plight in 1965 and formally acknowledged that the british and argentines were engaged in a territorial dispute over las malvinas the un asked the two sides to negotiate leading to a series of talks that lasted throughout the 1970s argentina and the united kingdom were able to agree to some minor power sharing measures but even as they hammered out the details the uk began making moves to exploit the resources that they had found on las malvinas the argentines protested this breach of good faith and the un passed a resolution calling on both sides to not alter the situation on the islands in the midst of their talks the uk took the resolution as an opportunity to reflect on their actions and after careful consideration continued to exploit the resources on las malvinos in flagrant disregard of the un mandate but the argentines would have little time to protest this naked playing fast and loose with diplomacy there were pressing issues at home that required government attention in fact it was the argentine government that was the pressing issue the same year the un condemned the british breach argentina was upended by a coup that saw a military junta seize power this group's military dictatorship sought to consolidate power through the elimination of its perceived opponents in what would become known as the dirty war a seven year campaign of terror up to 30 000 enemies of the junta were rounded up by state forces or paramilitary organizations and taken to detention centers where they were tortured murdered or in many cases both women who gave birth in detention had their children seized and adopted by members of the junta but the argentine people had more to contend with than these attempts to bring them to heal the economy was in shambles and the situation continued to spiral out of control as the junta devolved into infighting and its members jockeyed to take supreme executive power [Music] it was this jockeying that in 1981 saw a triumvirate made up of lieutenant general leopaldo caltieri admiral jorge anaya and brigadier general omar graffina to pose the current president and install galtieri into the role the continued economic woes and ongoing dirty war had made the junta immensely unpopular with the argentine people and like all politicians the three dictators knew that nothing brings the populace on side quite like a war they reasoned a quick splashy conflict ending in an easy win would drown out their critics in an overwhelming uproar of national pride on march 19 1982 a group of argentine marines landed on south georgia island 810 miles or 1300 kilometers from las malvinas dressed in civilian clothing the marines occupied an abandoned whaling station and raised their flag in effect claiming the island for the junta the british responded to this probe by sending argentina an ultimatum pull your people off the island or we will do it for you the hms endurance an armed icebreaker used as a patrol ship was sent to south georgia with a mighty force of 22 royal marines admiral anaya read this not as a warning but as an indication of apathy the force sent to reclaim the islands included barely as many men as an association football match and coupled with the overall drawdown of british ships and troops in the region the admiral confidently informed his cohorts that the math added up to a simple conclusion the british no longer cared about their south american territories argentina's splashy easy victory was ripe for the taking and it grew on the shores of las malvinas with the forthcoming cheers of their people already ringing in their ears the junta ordered an immediate invasion of the islands the army that would mount this invasion was a force of decently armed conscripts racked with internal difficulties the 10 000 argentine infantry committed to the invasion carried modern weaponry and equipment into battle including their own version of the belgian fn fal the argentine air force outnumbered the british raf three to one and would make deadly use of the cutting-edge exosa anti-ship missile against the legendary royal navy the achilles heel of the argentine forces however was morale your rank and file argentine had little motivation to fight a state of affairs exacerbated by some officers openly discussing with their men their opinion that the invasion was a poorly planned quickly executed glorified publicity stunt garrisons that would go on to be established on las malvinas came to be racked with apathy as officers and enlisted men alike waited for their time as bargaining chips to come to an end but more on that later life was made harder for the argentine soldiers by other more active officers many of whom had allegedly served as interrogators for the junta and would lead their men with a combination of torture and sometimes murder either for perceived cowardice or because the officers simply wanted to do it invasion veteran ernesto alonso recalled that their own officers were their worst enemies the cherry atop this jenga tower of complications was the junta's unwillingness despite their invasion fever to commit their best troops to the conflict for fear of a chilean invasion the junta kept their best troops on the home front sending underprepared conscripts to capture and reinforce las malvinas [Music] april 2nd 1982 argentine infantry land on las malvinas at 6 a.m heading straight for the airport the landing strip falls with no resistance and reinforcements are flown in just shy of three hours later rex hunt british governor of the islands realizes the futility of the situation and requests negotiations to end hostilities by 12 30 the argentines have taken the capital of port stanley raising their flag and renaming the city puerto argentino argentine port the only casualty is an argentine officer captain pedro gauchiano who dies in the assault on the colonial government headquarters the invasion is an unqualified success and with the speed of their victory and the lack of british deaths the argentines are confident the british will come hat in hand to the negotiating table las malvinas son argentinas the next day it was argentina's turn to be censured by the un the security council passed a resolution calling for the immediate withdrawal of argentine forces and efforts by both sides to seek a diplomatic solution argentina was shocked by this outcome particularly because the argentine envoy to the un believed he had secured a soviet promise to veto the resolution and by extension give their implicit support for the invasion the un vote was a reflection of argentina's perilous position on the international stage they were in a state of political isolation from many of their neighbors in latin america having no diplomatic relationship with cuba relations on the rocks with mexico over argentine asylum seekers fleeing to central america from the dirty war and a long-running border dispute with uruguay breeding much distrust between the two countries argentina's only supporters in the conflict were peru who would sell them a small number of outmoded fighters toward the end of hostilities as well as panama and venezuela as argentina weathered this diplomatic assault their forces on las malvinas prepared for a military one bringing additional material to the island to shore up their garrison joining this frenzy of rearmament was the argentine air force who had been largely excluded from planning up to this point argentina's pilots had to quickly shift their mindset as they were trained and equipped for a possible land war against chile the news that the uk was dispatching a naval task force to sail all the way from great britain to las malvinas highlighted a key weakness of this monomania few argentine planes were prepared for anti-ship combat and fewer of their pilots had trained in air-to-sea warfare as the british steamed for las malvinas the argentines dug in battle would not resume until the end of april [Music] april would prove to be a patriotic month for argentina the junta was careful to tailor the narrative ensuring that only the best possible news was given to the public military officers were installed in argentine newspapers and television networks overseeing coverage and keeping broadcasters and printers in line the argentine people erupted into a frenzy of support for their leaders coming together to almost universally back the same junta that had tortured and murdered for years even known critics of the junta like renowned polymath ernesto sabato couldn't help but come on side sabato himself declared in argentina it is not a military dictatorship that is fighting opponents to the regime like myself are fighting for our dignity fighting to extricate the last vestiges of colonialism don't be mistaken europe it is not a dictatorship that is fighting for the malvinas it is the whole nation this seems to indicate that in sabato's mind and perhaps the opponents of the junta who came to support it the desire to eradicate colonialism trumped the desire for democracy but it was not a desire that would survive the upcoming counter-attack [Music] on april 25th the first battle of the british offensive occurs at south georgia island the argentine submarine santa fe a desperately outmoded tub from the 1960s is spotted by british helicopters and depth charged the santa fe takes a direct hit and is forced to surface british helicopters coming in to finish her off in a display of courage that beggars belief the argentine submariners take to the deck of their ship firing fal rifles and light machine guns at the british hellos long enough for the santa fe to crawl into a friendly port but even as the santa fe escapes them the british land a mixed contingent of royal marines and special air service and special boat service commandos the small argentine garrison on south georgia surrenders without a fight clearing the way for the british to attack las malvinas the argentines on las malvinas can only watch as the british surround the islands establishing a naval exclusion zone around the archipelago puerto argentino is bombed on may 1st with the airport as the primary target this marks the first phase of battle in ernst an aerial and naval duel between the argentines and british this duel escalates the next day when the hms conqueror sinks the argentine cruiser general belgrano outside the naval exclusion zone killing 323 the attack on the belgrano will constitute half of argentina's war dead the junta orders its ships to return to port for the duration of the conflict ensuring that britannia rules the waves but these skies remain bitterly contested argentine flyers sink several british ships throughout the war at the cost of 22 planes and the last of their exocet missiles on may 4th british harriers launch an assault on the airfields at darwin a settlement outside puerto argentino only to have one of their planes downed by argentine anti-aircraft fire as the harriers rocket overhead and the argentines fill the sky with missiles and flack father pablo sosa tends to the argentine wounded giving them comfort or last rites in the chaos of battle the father would be unofficially canonized the saint of the trenches by grateful argentine soldiers but seldom are wars won exclusively in the air and sea and the conflict over las malvinas is no exception on may 21st the british land at port san carlos and ajax bay the 4 000 british initially face no opposition as the argentines have taken up static defensive positions ready to meet the assault from the trenches and earthworks argentine flyers do not let the british remain unopposed for long however launching sorties against the growing beachhead and racking up three sunk and eight severely damaged british ships many of which were carrying vital supplies in yet another case of truth being stranger than fiction the argentines were tipped off to the british landing point by none other than the bbc who ran a news story outlining the entirety of the british plan despite this utter betrayal by the producers of wallace and gromit the british forces fight their way through the argentine position and advance into the islands the argentines meet the british in battle at darwin on may 28th they're dug in positions enabling them to turn back the enemy late on the 28th the argentines receive additional reinforcements and lieutenant colonel italo piaci commander of the darwin garrison seems to have the advantage until the british send two pows to piahi with a message surrender immediately or our artillery will bring darwin crashing down around your ears piahi chooses to surrender justifying his decision thus the battle had turned into a sniping contest they could sit well out of range of our soldiers fire and if they wanted to raise the settlement the next day would see one thousand argentines at goose green a settlement two miles or roughly three kilometers southeast of darwin fight a british force three times smaller and be overrun between the battles at darwin and goose green the argentines lose 55 men and suffer 86 wounded and 900 captured the british capitalize on their momentum sweeping argentines off of mount kent a key position overlooking puerto argentino the argentines at the port nevertheless persist launching a wave of airstrikes on the british supply ships as they mass in the nearby pleasant bay despite the argentine efforts the british land more troops and supplies around puerto argentina general mario menendez commander of argentine forces on las malvinas orders his men to oppose these landings and while the argentines put up a fierce fight they are unable to prevent the british from assaulting and occupying the remaining heights around the would-be argentine capital between june 11th and june 14th with their position secured the british begin shelling puerto argentino destroying military installations and vehicles with pinpoint accuracy as shells rain down on him from above menendez realizes that the fight is lost and surrenders to the british on the 14th las malvinas son britannicas the revelation of surrender hits the argentine people like a train the junta's narrative quickly broke down as outside news sources began to be made available juan bautista joffrey an argentine intelligence officer wrote of the disparity between reality and the junta's propaganda machine it was remarkable even irritating to watch the north american news with correspondents in buenos aires and london and compare what the argentine media maintained about the development of the conflict the disaster of the malvinas conflict would prove to be the straw that broke the junta's back with the truth out the argentine people erupted into a wave of protests between the economic crisis the state of terror and now the loss of las malvinas the people were finally ready to rise up even some members of the military joined them the triumvirate of galtiary anaya and graffina was swept aside replaced by one alfredo saint jean who very quickly was replaced by reynaldo bignone caught between a population that had finally had enough and a military seemingly in the same frame of mind bignone called a general election in 1983 and the junta was cast from power in a wellspring of democracy argentina has been a federal republic since las malvinas or the falkland islands were laid low by the conflict the infrastructure of puerto argentino or port stanley completely broke under the pressure of the falklanders the british forces and the 11 000 argentine prisoners left there general menendez tried to arrange for humane repatriation of his men but the british seemed more interested in expediency cramming over 4 000 argentines onto one ocean liner alone before sending it back to buenos aires 649 argentines lost their lives in the battle for the malvinas islands lives that seem to have been lost in vain for as the argentine foreign ministry states to this day the 1982 conflict did not alter the nature of the sovereignty dispute between argentina and the united kingdom over the malvinas the british have long since lost their interest in negotiating with the argentines trying to call them back to the table as recently as 2021 a move that interestingly coincides with low approval ratings for the argentine government at time of writing [Music] so [Music] [Music] you\",\n",
       " \" [Music] the 1600s saw a slow but steady transformation of the french army from an ad hoc collection of private levies and mercenary companies into a standing professional force who swore loyalty directly to the king in 1671 louis xiv issued a royal ordinance that resulted in the creation of a standardized uniform for the army left by his predecessor louis xiii after 1684 this consisted of a black tricorn or bicorn hat and gray white coat with colored linings to indicate specific units and ranks the french infantry also made extensive use of the fusel a light flintlock musket this led to them being known as fusiliers a name which stuck decades after the weapon was retired from use colonial french line infantry during the french and indian war were gray white woolen breeches stockings and overcoats units were identified by the color of their waistcoats while tricorn hats were most common many soldiers carried small hatchets similar to native tomahawks as these were of much more practical use than swords [Music] high-ranking officers in the french and indian war had typically gaudy uniforms with extensive gold braiding and plumed wide-brimmed chapeau hats in various styles unlike their lower ranks they still wore and used swords as these were symbols of the gentry just prior to the start of the french revolution the french soldier wore a white turnback coat fastened by lapels alongside breeches and stockings equipment was often worn by belts around the waist or slung from the shoulder an important and hated feature was the high stock worn around the neck designed to keep the head forcibly erect as stability returned to the french army so did standardized uniforms many features from the pre-revolutionary period were capped but white coats were exchanged for blue in 1801 a new military cap called the shaco was introduced for light regiments then implemented for all line regiments in 1807. standard equipment included a curved saber 65 centimeters or 25 and a half inches long for elite companies and a 128 centimeter or 4 foot 2 inch 17.1 millimeter caliber musket the short and agile skirmishers of napoleon's army were known as voltiger or valters and commonly wore green and yellow epulets to distinguish them from the regular fusiliers among the french grenadiers none were more senior nor more distinguished than the old guard which formed the heart of napoleon's army during his conquest of europe the old guard wore beautifully ornate bare skin caps with brass plates stamped with the imperial eagle adorned with white cords red plumes and a red patch bearing a golden grenade their turnback coats for an additional pair of gold grenades in contrast to the red grenades worn by the regular grenadiers as the bourbon dynasty expanded the empire overseas they began recruiting heavily from local populations among these were these waves initially imported from north africa but eventually recruited from all over europe wearing open fronted blue jackets sheshia headdresses and thick baggy trousers the zwabs were superb light infantry and earned decoration after decoration in french service in 1831 king louis philippe established the french foreign legion one of the most famous and long-lasting military units in history initially stationed in algeria the foreign legion was as it name implied intended to be made mainly of foreign recruits legionnaires who participated in the second french intervention in mexico used the model 1859 carbine and often adopted zoave style braided jackets and fezzes to help cope with the heat by the time of the franco-prussian war line infantry had replaced the shackle with the much simpler keppy colored a bright red with blue branding and black peak the standard uniform was also blue with trousers dyed matter red obsolete musket technology was also replaced by the shasipo bolt action breech loading rifle that was among the best infantry weapons of the era despite their defeat at the hands of the north german confederation in 1871 the french maintained a powerful colonial empire while working to establish a french protectorate in vietnam the french marine infantry of the tonkin expeditionary corps wore the m-78 colonial helmet and white trousers with a black belt and two pouches half a century later the soldiers of the french third republic marched into battle still wearing their highly recognizable blue and red uniforms and equipped with the m93 lebel rifle the first standard infantry rifle to use smokeless powder unfortunately the weapon was also excessively long for trench warfare while the bright blue french coats made them easy targets for enemy fire likewise french officers were easily identified by enemy snipers thanks to the gold trim on their keppy's and gold lace work decorating their coats after their baptism by fire the french quickly disbanded with their bright red trousers and introduced new horizon blue overcoats they were also the first major power to issue steel helmets beginning with the m15 adrian helmet in 1915. french soldiers frequently copied the british puttees or cloth wrappings around the ankles and lower legs to help deal with the perpetual mud and blood of the trenches as with many nations the french air force began as just another branch of the army formed in october of 1910 it was a pioneering force in early aircraft design french pilots wore blue uniforms like their army counterparts but donned extremely thick wool lined overcoats and padded leather hats and goggles before climbing into the open-air cockpits of early fighter aircraft by the start of the second world war the french had done away with the blue uniforms entirely and replaced them with khaki infantry now wore a modernized version of the adrian helmet known as the m26 after their defeat at the hands of the axis the new vichy french government were allowed to keep a small army that was equipped with a mix of standard french gear from 1940 and german castoffs such as various pre-war models of the iconic german stallhelm the free french were a lot less lucky and were forced to rely almost completely on the british for supplies resulting in uniforms more or less identical to those of their allies to distinguish themselves from their anglo-saxon comrades most free french wore lapel badges with various symbols of liberty such as the cross of lorraine british influence on french uniform designs did not end with the second world war during the indochina campaign the foreign legion wore french m47 uniforms and bush hats with british webbing the standard rifle remained the world war ii era bolt action mass 36 but was extensively supplemented by a motley collection of french british and american weapons during the algerian war colonial french infantry commonly wore the mle 4756 lizard camo pattern uniform with lightweight shoes called patugaz made from canvas or rubber in 1978 the french armed forces adopted the famas f1 assault rifle a french-built competitor to similar weapons like the m16 and fn fal they were also issued model 1978 helmet to replace older models dating as far back as 1951. infantry uniforms remained a mixture of olive drab and khaki to compete with similar units like the british sas and german gs g9 the french created the gi gn or national gendarmery intervention group in 1974. as an elite special forces unit the gign are equipped with cutting-edge technology and their assault teams usually wear dark blue uniforms with numerous tactical pouches and bullet resistant inserts in non-combat situations they also can be seen wearing the dark blue beret of the national gendarmery during the war on terror french troops began a campaign against the insurgency in the maghreb region of africa at this time infantry were equipped with the fallah system which included a modified famas with a telescopic night sight and a spectra helmet outfitted with light amplification goggles and various other electronics the uniform featured both hard ballistic plates rated against rifle caliber ammunition and soft protection against small arms fire and shrapnel although founded by napoleon the salsir special military academy still serves as the french equivalent of sandhurst academy or west point officers attending ceremonial functions where an ornate dark blue uniform with red epileps and red or gold shoulder boards depending on rank headwear consists of a pale blue shackle cap with a prominent red and white plume [Music] [Music]

found themselves falling short of critical objectives operation barbarossa was meant not only to seize soviet territory but more critically to supply the third reich with desperately needed raw materials namely oil germany was running out of fuel even with their junior partner romania pouring over 100 000 tons of oil barrels into germany's collective tank as the vermost burned through their meager supplies hitler and high command turned their gaze toward capturing the oil fields of caucasia the summer of 1942 would see the nazis focus their efforts on the southern soviet union with the goal of capturing these oil fields a plan better known as fallblau or case blue however hitler would later add another objective the capture of the city of stalingrad a logistical center named for his communist frenemy in this video we will focus on the bloody and brutal battle of stalingrad as two dictators send their men into a meat grinder for the sake of oil and renown before we hit the streets

of nazi plans for case blue though an important transport hub hosting a number of factories and steel works the initial drafts of case blue were focused entirely on securing the caucasian oil fields the volga hugging city of half a million inhabitants just didn't figure in two german plans with the failure of operation barbarossa still fresh in their minds and the front line stagnating the dawn of spring meant it was time for a new push into the soviet union this push involved an axis army of 1.3 million men 300 000 of whom were soldiers from italy romania hungary and croatia advancing towards ostragon before securing their northern flank along the dawn and the volga then advancing south toward the caucasus the ever erratic hitler however decided this plan was far too simple and ordered army group south split in two so they could achieve both objectives simultaneously the newly christened group a would drive for the caucasus mountains in the south while group b would make for the ostragon by way of the don and volga satisfied that he had complicated his generals lives sufficiently hitler let the offensive begin on june 28th the soviets were taken completely by surprise and found the second verse of the nazi invasion the same as the first the germans made rapid progress into soviet territory and by mid july the german sixth army under friedrich palus was within striking distance of stalingrad hitler ordered stalingrad be taken on july 23rd in addition to being a transport hub and possessing some manufacturing stalingrad served as an artery in the lend lee system that saw allied supplies shipped to the soviets by way of iran but hitler's sixth army was growing weaker with every instant german supply lines were stretched so thin that in a grim omen of things to come some germans resorted to eating their horses in addition a full quarter of paulus's casualties thus far had been due to typhus and dysentery which dug their claws deep into both german and soviet forces speaking of soviets stalin had predicted hitler's change of strategy and was making preparations factories turned out a tidal wave of tanks and reserves were brought in to reinforce stalingrad on july 27th stalin issued the infamous order 227 commanding all soviet soldiers to take not a step back and laid down heavy penalties for officers who retreated without approval the command was given in direct response to an idea that was sweeping the dispirited red army the soviets should outrun the nazis retreating deeper and deeper into the vast territories of the soviet union until the most advantageous time to fight presented itself where the will to fight did in his order stalin countered this narrative with one of his own russian civilians forced under the german yoke were cursing the red army for abandoning them in their time of most desperate need the workers of russia called on their soldiers to fight back in stalingrad these same civilians were conscripted to dig trenches or work emergency shifts in arms factories after nearly a month of preparations on both sides the germans and their allies crossed the don river on august 21st setting the stage for one of the bloodiest actually the bloodiest fight in history the luftwaffe opened the assault on stalingrad with a multi-day bombing which reaches its zenith on august 23rd 600 bombers of luftflota 4 level massive swaths of this city killing between 40 to 75 000 people german spearheads draw close to the city not long thereafter encountering fanatical resistance before driving to the volga on the northern side and are promptly cut off by the communists a pocket forms around this spearhead and troops under general gustav anton von wiederscheim are encircled two days later general hermann hoth leads the fourth panzer army in an attack on the southern side of the city only for the russians to turn him back a second armored spearhead manages to break through the northern pocket and drop off critical supplies but the would-be rescuers abandon the pocket when it becomes clear they did not bring sufficient infantry to hold their position the soviets to the south slowly lose men to the northern front line with the final division remaining in the sector belonging to the nkvd the secret police are soon reassigned to the northern sector as well and the drawdown gives hoth an opening as the civilian population breaks into a panic he drives northward ultimately covering 20 kilometers or just under 12.5 miles the soviet commander yayaramka withdraws his men to better defensive positions within the city as the germans advance august ends with paulus's sixth army breaking into the northern encirclement relieving their comrades after a week of dug-in fighting the german lines solidify and as september begins the nazis partially encircled stalin's city gyorgy zhukov future hero of the soviet union launches an attack in the north meant to break up the german line and once again encircle the fascists but the germans are able to hold fast zhukov may not encircle his foes but he captures their attention and ties down a number of paulus's men hitler seeing yet another opportunity to complicate matters dismisses the commander of army group b and takes personal command of operations in the north with the fuhrer himself as their leader the germans continue to make the exact same slow but steady progress into stalingrad with the fourth gaining ground to the south the 29th motor division in particular becomes the first german unit to reach the southern shores of the volga on september 9th with the 29th in place the soviet defenders are split into their constituent groups the 62nd and 64th armies find themselves cut off from each other with the 60-second reliant on supplies ferried across the volga supplies that must make their way through intense german fire the 62nd is woefully under strength with their only complete division being the nkvd rifleman that were pulled out in the face of hoth's drive last month despite their shortcomings these 60-second fights hard resisting the germans as they push into the suburbs vasily choikov commander of the 62nd orders his frontline troops to hug the german lines keeping in constant contact to prevent the luftwaffe providing air support lest they bomb their fellow aryans the close quarters leads to intense urban combat as the soviets fight the axis room by room house by house opening a brutal new phase of the battle the germans reached stalingrad proper on september 13th the luftwaffe once again rains bombs onto the city playing a duet of destruction with german heavy artillery these soviets respond in kind counter-barraging with their own guns and katyusha rockets elements of the sixth army push deep into the city and force the soviets into a near envelopment despite fierce resistance the germans capture critical hills overlooking the city center and over the next two days the germans will advance through stalagrad center capturing railway stations and driving hard for the volga with the fourth providing support in the south the sixth army reaches the volga in just one day placing the germans well inside stalingrad but all is not sunshine and sauerkraut for the germans the soviets recapture the heights overlooking the city center on september 16th general von wiederscheim who had so nobly commanded the encircled germans at the opening of the assault is sacked when he posits the germans will ultimately fail to take stalingrad and suggests a withdrawal from their volga positions and further complicating matters a group of 50 soviet soldiers fortify a grain elevator famously holding off the germans as their offensive begins to slow the ragged soviets in the grain elevator would hold out for another four days until the germans finally cleared them on the 21st these would not be the last soviet holdouts however as around this same time a group of soviet soldiers seize and fortify an apartment block that would come to be known as pavlov's house pavlovs would hold out until november a siege within a siege of 60 days the germans end september holding roughly two-thirds of stalingrad and preparing for a final push into the industrial heartland of the city the beleaguered soviets are reinforced by the 1047th rifle regiment who cross the volga on the 22nd they are not the only reinforcements these soviets can expect however the temperature in stalingrad begins dropping the icy winds a dispatch from the russian's old ally general winter these gales provide a fitting prelude to a storm gathering in the russian camp for almost the entire month of september in utmost secrecy joseph stalin gyorgy zhukov and vistafka the russian high command have been formulating plans for a counter-offensive and they're almost ready to make their move as the soviet reinforcements continue to make their way into stalingrad palus launches an assault on the industrial sector the reinforced soviets pushed the nazis back and on october 4th palus learns that the 51st corps along the tip of the germanic spear has taken such extensive casualties that it has lost all offensive capability the german halt offensive operations for a full 10 days to rest and resupply save for a push on october 13th by hoth that sees the fourth army finally reach the volga the rest of october will be a hard slog for the germans and soviets both as the germans renew their assault on the industrial district and begin to make headway the germans pay dearly for every minute they advance and the bombing raids by the luftwaffe that had opened the battle bear bitter fruit goring's aces leave a trail of destruction in their wake that inadvertently shifts the battle ever so slightly in the favor of the soviet defenders the communists fortify or hide in hollowed-out buildings and mazes of rubble making the corpse of the city into a near continuous line of defenses and traps that force the germans to advance methodically and fight nose-to-nose [Music] the german advance through the industrial zone continues through november as the soviets resist them at every step by the 11th the soviets are pushed into isolated pockets of resistance in factories and houses pockets the germans throw assault after assault at assaults that soviets repel time and again before ultimately failing the germans low on men materiel and willpower begin to stumble a week later the soviets hold only a stretch of the shoreline at the volga no more than 10 percent of the city the russians are on the ropes but the germans are too battered and under-supplied to press their assault palus could count over 60 000 casualties in the sixth army alone both the germans and besieged russians lick their wounds and settle into rhythms of a stalemate neither side aware of the earth-shattering events to come as general winter covers stalingrad in a raging blizzard zhukov springs his long-prepared trap the soviets launched their mammoth counter-offensive appropriately dubbed operation uranus at 3 o'clock on november 19th 10 soviet armies totaling 1 million men almost a thousand tanks and over a thousand planes wash over the germans like a crimson tide looking to break out and lock the nazis in a pincer over a 400 kilometer or 248 mile front uranus is timed perfectly as the frigid winds serve a natural coolant for the tanks allowing them to drive harder and farther the allies land in north africa at the same time splitting the attention of high command in berlin over the course of three days the soviets succeed in completely reversing the fortunes of the battle tearing into the axis lines to encircle 40 000 romanian troops protecting the germans southern flank before driving their pincers into an almost total encirclement of the fourth and sixth armies palus is presented with a fateful decision attempt a breakout or dig in and wait for the metaphorical cavalry as the noose begins to tighten around him high command begins entertaining the idea of resupplying the sixth army by air an idea that would lay the foundation for the sixth army's destruction in a conference on the 23rd luftwaffe chief of staff hans yeshanek guarantees hitler the delivery of 500 tons of supplies per day to their forces in stalingrad despite palus estimating he needs 700 and the luftwaffe's own estimate that they could manage 300 at best the message reaches the fuhrer just as high command convinces him that a breakout is the only way to salvage the situation buoyed by his air force's confidence hitler approves the airlift the luftwaffe begins dropping critical stockpiles of ammunition and fuel but no food as the encirclement drags on the german army starves bread rations are slashed in desperation and the men begin dining on sumptuous feasts of horse fat wounded men awaiting medevac are placed into thin tents next to supply runways and as general winter marches on the german forces the wounded freeze to death in their cots on november 26th paulu sends a dispatch to friedrich von manstein overall commander of the german military paulus complains that he had not received any communication from high command for over 36 hours and that hitler had denied his request for freedom of action paulus asks von manstein to relieve his besieged force or else formally order him to attempt a breakout for his part manstein is confident that the sixth army can hold their position with the luftwaffe airdrops as their lifeline confidence that will soon be put to the test as the german starve and the soviets advance the battle of stalingrad enters its brutal conclusion as winter well and truly sets in the supply situation in the german pocket becomes dire the 3500 soviet pows who have survived long enough to be held by the germans within their encirclement are officially cut off from all rations as the germans must get every scrap of food into their own bellies the soviets resort to melting snow which is contaminated by debris and urine for water and cannibalizing on their own dead comrades meanwhile the germans guarding them begin venting their rage on their prisoners brutalizing them with their weapons and dogs when the battle of stalingrad ends only 30 soviet pows will be liberated by their comrades but that is months from now as the snow piles up around him and the luftwaffe finally begins delivering desperately needed supplies of food palus take stock of the sixth army thirty-four thousand of three hundred thousand who marched on stalingrad are still alive on december 12th von manstein launches operation winter storm an attempt to break through to palus and relieve the germans trapped in stalingrad palus asks hitler for permission to break out and once again he is refused the sixth army can only wait for liberty or destruction there are no other options von manstein drives for stalingrad and after a week is bogged down by the soviets in a mere 48 kilometer or 29 miles from the city new offensives way lay von manstein further and the dutiful palus continues to follow his fuhrer's orders to stay put as christmas arrives in stalingrad general winter makes a special delivery to the nazis on christmas day 1300 men die a frost frostbite on mass the soviets bring presents of their own launching an endless stream of harassing attacks and probes as they freeze to death or are shot by these soviets one can imagine the german soldiers ardently wishing for saint nicholas to bring them some coal at least they could burn it for warmth the new year would only bring new misery for the germans bands of soldiers roam the ruined streets looking for food and warmth thousands of wounded languish untreated due to lack of supplies these soviets offer the germans a generous surrender giving paulus the chance to save his men and himself from certain death at the hands of general zhukov or general winter the proud prussian refuses and on january 6th the soviets launch a new wave of attacks that carve the sixth army in two pieces as his men are forced into two disparate pockets paulus's supply situation worsens the soviet attacks force his soldiers to abandon critical airfields and even if they could be held the luftwaffe begins throttling back on supply drops decreasing the tonnage dropped as the encirclement drags on the 22nd the soviets again solicit a surrender and paulu sends a message to hitler that his men have no ammunition nor food and that his ability to command them is degrading by the moment two days later he reports that he has 18 000 wounded left completely untreated and begs hitler for permission to surrender his men to the soviets hitler orders paulus to hold his position to the last man the last cartridge not a day later the soviets capture the last remaining airfield that the germans can use to receive airdrops whatever paulus has in his stores was all he ever will throughout the encircled sixth and fourth a hundred thousand men die in january alone and the two armies have been split into northern and southern pockets with no way of communicating as paulo struggles with hitler's order not to surrender he receives a most unwelcome surprise a promotion from hitler himself to field marshall but instead of an honor it was a death sentence as no field marshal had ever surrendered or been captured alive before with the stroke of his pen hitler orders paulus to place himself upon the altar of national socialism and die on january 31st paulus becomes the first german field marshal taken captive to hear him tell it paulus and his headquarters staff who were based out of a department store basement were suddenly overrun by soviet forces and had no choice but to allow themselves to be taken into captivity palus would insist to the last man that he never formally surrendered to the russians and refused their commands to order his men to stand down the southern pocket collapses under the weight of paulus's capture but the northern hangs on barely the next day general carl strecker de facto commander of the northern pocket gathers his staff to tell them of the southern collapse he issues a general order empowering all troops under his command to act according to the dictates of their conscience a flowery way of saying surrender if you want to live without actually uttering the words and that is exactly what striker does on february 2nd the sixth army formally surrenders to georgie zhukov but 11 000 germans refused to give up the fight going to ground in the ruins of stalingrad there is no fanatical resistance or desperate grab at victory however these were germans fearful of soviet reprisal with no central command nor mission other than survival these holdouts would hide in the ruins and sewers by day and scavenge what they could at night their lives were desperate and violent engaging in running gunfights with soviet forces and scratching for meager survival by day it would take until march of 1943 for the soviets to root out these renegade germans and fully secure stalingrad the civilian population of stalingrad fared little better than the men in uniform though there were sporadic evacuations of civilians throughout the battle either organized by the germans or soviets or in panicked response to the shifting tides of battle the loss of life was still enormous 170 000 civilians died in the battle of stalingrad and this number includes those who died after the war after being enslaved by the germans and marched to force labor camps in the ukraine and elsewhere while the soviet pows under german care had been almost annihilated the germans would fare no better 95 of the men captured by the soviets at the end of the battle wouldn't see home again stalingrad was a bloodbath a churning engine of destruction fed by human life and misery but it was also a testament to the fighting spirit of those on the ground as the soviets clung by their very fingernails to the city and threw the germans back [Music] you\",\n",
       " \" [Music] an old man looks out the window bright july sun dances across the waves and the sound of surf gently breaking on the island's shore fills the bedroom but it is not a pastoral seascape the man sees marshall philippe pitta looks out of a window to his past to the glory he won at verdun to his tenure as minister of war and then to the fateful election that gave him near absolute power over france to his collaboration with hitler to participating in the slaughter of his own people the despoiling of his own nation and when the army of free france returned to civil war as bhitang closes his eyes for the final time so does it close a conflicted life led by a man who believed resolutely in the necessary actions of vichy france with that the leader of an often overlooked axis power goes to his final rest hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian to say the second world war was a difficult time for france would be an understatement bordering on absurdity the war was a time of privation and subjugation as well as political division with the fall of france the nation was divided in two a german-occupied zone to the north and a nazi client state to the south this second state would come to be known as vichy france named for the resort town that served as its government seat headed by marshall philippe pita a celebrated general and politician this fascist france would begin the war siding against the allies and bringing the holocaust to the jews of france only to find themselves suddenly occupied by big brother hitler when the tide of war turned in today's video we will look at the formation contributions and eventual downfall of vichy france during its brief existence the citizens of vichy france were subjected to a constant barrage

france in may of 1940 the government of the third republic was in turmoil opinion was split on whether to keep up the fight against germany or sign an armistice and pick up the pieces afterward prime minister paul renaud was of a hawkish bent but faced stern opposition from his newly installed deputy marshal philippe pita pita was loved by the french people for his successes during the first world war and had returned to paris following a stint as ambassador to francois spain pitta argued vigorously for an armistice portraying it as a way to halt the carnage and allow the french people to begin the process of rebuilding as his ministers debated and the germans continued to advance renault began to realize the hopelessness of his situation on may 26th renault took a meeting with winston churchill where the embattled french prime minister told the british representative that while he was against signing a separate peace with germany the french military had no hope of triumph over the third reich and though renault would not negotiate with hitler he was surrounded by men who would the british would encourage renault to keep up the fight one way or another until the bitter end mere weeks later the germans reached paris forcing renault's government to relocate south to tour the collapse of france was imminent but the debate over whether or not to sue for peace continued to rage the pro-armistice faction began to espouse the view that if they stayed and negotiated the french could somehow control the outcome of the peace talks by engaging with the germans and signing an armistice they could have a say over their destiny alternatively the government could withdraw entirely to london and renault could lead a french government in exile alongside the polish this view was unpopular due to the aforementioned delusion of control as well as simple anglophobia besides the argument for fleeing was answered with a simple fact a french government in france would be more powerful than one in england as renault tried to find a way out tried to settle on a definitive course he began to find himself squeezed in a vice pitta and other high ministers began publicly campaigning for an armistice the deputy prime minister declaring his intent to remain in france and share the french people's fate and suffering after so much deliberation and debate after so much pressure and so much back and forth with britain renault resigned on june 18th pitan was asked to form a government and the new prime minister set about obtaining his armistice the third french republic and nazi germany would sign the armistice of june 22 1940 on well june 22 1940. in a move of petty humiliation the nazis hosted the signing in the same train car that had witnessed the surrender of the german empire in the first world war all fighting in france would cease and the french would make germany whole for the cost of their upcoming occupation the tall's ascension after renault's resignation gave him the requisite powers to negotiate this unequal treaty with the nazis who recognized him as the proper authority to treat with them a number of french military and civilian ministers as well as rank-and-file soldiers fled the country to establish the free french under former undersecretary of war charles de gaulle de gaulle's group would find little recognition in the allied camp with the free french denied the status of government in exile that would legitimize them internationally baton was the legitimate leader of france [Music] as the armistice came into effect the germans began the military dismemberment of their conquered foes the french army was disbanded save for 100 000 men who would perform internal security duties the french navy was ordered to pull all of its ships that were abroad for mothballing a demand that the british would not accept a number of french vessels were stationed in british ports and the empire feared that the germans could use a stockpile of french warships in future battles in the atlantic the result was operation catapult an attempt to neutralize the french navy by any means necessary french vessels in british ports were seized while a large squadron in algeria was set upon by the royal navy the british offered to escort the french to ports in britain the united states or even the french possessions in the caribbean french admiral francois derlong ordered his men not to comply and the british attacked their erstwhile allies darlang was incensed and ordered the french navy to attack the royal navy on site meanwhile in one of history's many parallels the crisis gave pitta his opening to acquire absolute power pata severed diplomatic relations with the british over their attack in algeria and ordered an ultimately ineffective bombing of gibraltar in retaliation pro-german sympathies had begun to manifest in baton's cabinet with many coming to believe germany would win the war france must opportunistically make her place in hitler's europe or be relegated to the dust bin of history the fighting on the seas of algeria had also bred a sense of alienation in the french cabinet with the royal navy's actions seen as proof that france had been betrayed by the british deputy prime minister pierre lavalle rammed through a quartet of laws that gave baton the power to appoint and dismiss ministers and unilaterally enact legislation dissolved the french parliament and empowered bataan to appoint his successor who just so happened to be leval the dictatorial laws went into effect on july 10 and vichy france was born with their fascist future secured patal's government set about building a new ideology of hate and acting on it like their german partners the vichy government sought to weave a narrative around their loss that would bring their chosen people together they lost to germany was blamed on the enemies of the homeland jews communists expatriates and others with their targets identified the vichy regime set about enacting their own version of the nuremberg laws first public servants had to prove their father was french then the government began stripping naturalized frenchmen of their citizenship many of whom were jews then french jews were excluded from public office and all occupations that influenced people barring jews from academia journalism and the french film industry with these laws in place the vichy regime promised to return france to true french people it was these true french that formed the malays a fiercely collaborationist paramilitary organization headed by joseph darnold a veteran of the first world war the molise were radically conservative and catholic condemning in their oaths of induction such evils as communism freemasonry and jewish leprosy though banned from operating in nazi-occupied zones and originally distrusted by the germans the molise would be embraced by the nazis after darnall swore a personal oath of fealty to adolf hitler this feudal arrangement would see darnall made an officer in the ss and the formerly unarmed milies outfitted with german weaponry collaboration would only grow more murderous as the holocaust began in ernst though nominally independent vichy france had a stated policy of concession and collaboration a policy that only intensified as the war progressed beginning in october 1940 foreign jews still living in france were interred by vichy and german authorities both a state of affairs that would continue until summer of 1942 when hitler ordered the total annihilation of european jewry patal's government didn't so much partner with germany in enacting this order as totally subordinate themselves vichy france became the only unoccupied nation to actively round up and export its jews for slaughter almost viewing it as a question of sovereignty their issue wasn't handing over jews to die it was ensuring french hands delivered them pierre lavalle encouraged the nazis to take as many jews from vichy france as they could even pushing them to expand the parameters of their deportation mandates to include children the ptal government received many reports on the existence of extermination camps so it is highly unlikely these demands were made from a place of ignorance this is supported by laval's rejection of an american offer to accept 1 000 children of deported jews as refugees laval decreed that only verifiable orphans would be given to the americans but since the vichy government could not trace deported jews to determine whether or not they died they never allowed the americans to take a single child not everyone was as eager to assist the nazis in their plans renee bousquet chief of police for vichy france actively sought to prioritize the deportation of foreign-born jews over french ones due to his knowledge that he was sending them to their deaths a kind of gruesome patriotism in the face of the holocaust busquet would go on to ignore german demands for access to lists of jews as the vichy state began to collapse but more on that later after the war busquet was tried for collaboration had his sentence commuted due to his isolated instances of resistance and was ultimately charged with crimes against humanity by a new tribunal in 1993 only to be assassinated days before his second trial as the vichy made war on the enemies of the homeland within they also fought against germany's enemies without april of 1941 saw an anti-british coup in iraq an event the germans were eager to capitalize on germany offered the batall government a release of french pows if they would allow the luftwaffe to operate out of french syria a deal the vichy readily accepted german planes were in position by early may and the vichy french and nazi germans went on to utterly fail in their objectives the british crushed the revolt and followed up their victory with a joint free french british invasion of syria and lebanon just over a month later the allies were in control of both colonies and for all their trouble the vichy french received absolutely nothing from the germans from 1941 to 1942 the small vichy garrisons throughout africa would see minor action as british forces attempted to keep them corralled though the british initially were able to completely blockade the garrison in djibouti for example japan's east asian blitz creek forced the british to reorganize and the blockade of djibouti was abandoned allowing the fascist french to send intelligence on british naval movements through the suez canal to their german allies this would not be the end of vichy troubles however as the british launched an assault on the island of madagascar long held as a french colony and loyal to bhutan on may 5th british forces landed in an attempt to deny the japanese friendly ports so close to shipping lanes in southeast asia the british were able to seize the island but did so without consulting their junior partner de gaulle the leader of the free french made an open overture to the soviets in response indicating interest in re-establishing the free french headquarters in moscow the british like any scared partner bought de gaulle's affection by naming the free french as the new government in madagascar as the cross of lorraine was raised over madagascar the allies laid plans for another offensive in africa one that would ultimately lead to the dissolution of vichy france in november 1942 the allies launched operation torch the invasion of north africa allied forces swept into the vichy french territories of morocco and algeria and the germans decided that an invasion of southern france would likely follow the allied attack to prevent this hitler ordered case anton the military occupation of vichy france as the nazis gustapped into vichy territory several of patan's advisors encouraged him to flee to what territory they still held in africa but the collaborationist dictator refused the vichy state began to rot from the inside under german occupation pierre lavalle buoyed by french fascists who hoped to ride his coattails ascended to the role of prime minister succeeding his pal patan but the two were little more than figureheads to deliver german orders in french accents the vichy authorities began to chafe under their new found yokes with government offices dragging their feet on german orders or passively refusing to comply with their former partners others took more direct action admiral darla who in the time between his private war on the royal navy and operation torch had served in a number of government posts was in algeria when the allies made landfall and decided that his coat could use a good turn derlan made contact with the americans and the two negotiated the sweetest of sweetheart deals the americans would back derla taking control of french north africa and he would rally support for the allies on the ground der long would never get the chance however as an anti-vichy assassin slew him in december of 1943 as the germans began exercising more and more direct control over vichy france their collaborators began vying for power in vichy circles this led to infighting that culminated in an attempted coup by patan against his former deputy pata and a cabal of ministers reasoned that perhaps germany wouldn't win the war after all and if they could wrest back control vichy france could open negotiations with the allies and control the outcome of the peace talks hitler knew of bhutan's plan and explicitly warned the marshal of the consequences of failure so naturally baton went ahead anyways and the germans ensured he failed the marshal was imprisoned by the germans whose price for saving laval's diminished position was the installation of parisian ministers loyal to germany overall most vichy ministers stood by their government for various reasons indoctrination guaranteed pay or the safety of their families this loyalty kept the vichy regime on life support until operation overlord as the allies drove into france through the summer and fall of 1944 pitta and laval were forcibly removed to germany the germans re-established the seat of the vichy government in the town of ziegmeringen but leval refused to comply with the germans in protest of his relocation and pata had long since abandoned collaboration the free french were installed as the new french government following the liberation of paris stripping patan and laval of what little power they had left finally the vichy government limped along until the allies liberated ziegmeringen in 1945. with the war's end it was time for bataan to return to france he was offered asylum by the swiss but steadfastly refused the former dictator was adamant that the french people needed to hear his side of the story and stood trial in 1945 under the auspices of the de gaulle government pitta believed the free french government was illegitimate and saved for delivering a prepared statement lauding the vichy regime as protector of france remained largely silent refusing to dignify what he saw as a sham trial with his participation the tribunal proceeded regardless and beta was convicted of treason the 89 year old patal was sentenced to death but de gaulle personally commuted his sentence to life imprisonment at the court's request the fallen idol of the french people was shuffled between a handful of prisons and private homes until his declining health led to his death in 1951. there is a popular image of france as the doormat upon which germany wiped their jack boots on their way to conquering europe the fight for france was certainly uneven but reducing the entire french war experience to simply surrendering ignores the nuanced and complicated truth of a nation brought low by a true force of evil the vichy regime was an attempt by a cabal of uncaring opportunists to reap the rewards of chaos a cavalcade of brown nosing for personal profit paired with the very real collaboration of civilians and partisan fighters ironically this fascinating and sinister facet of the second world war is often overlooked in favor of the simplistic narrative of french surrender followed by the romantic struggle of the french resistance a unified monolith struggling until the dawn of allied liberation but history like truth resists simplicity the history of france especially [Music] [Music] [Music] you\",\n",
       " \" the evolution of japanese uniforms poster is available now in its dying years the ailing tokugawa shogunate attempted to reform and modernize its military force shogun tokugawa yoshinobu introduced new european style uniforms modeled after those of britain and france but these retained japanese influences such as the traditional gingasa war hats soldiers were equipped with more modern firearms but infantrymen continued to carry swords alongside them traditional samurai armor however was extremely rare however this reform was too little too late for the shogunate emperor meiji and his allies in the satsuma and shoshu domains successfully seized power from the shogun in a brief conflict finally restoring the supremacy of the emperor their forces were highly modernized with western style uniforms soldiers of the satsuma domain were distinguished by their peculiar conical headgear while those of the shoshu domain were shorter helmets before we continue i'd like to

off of your lordship titles the imperial guard was the foundation of the new imperial japanese army first seeing action against disaffected samurai in the satsuma rebellion these soldiers wore the first standardized national uniform a mixture of blue and red with their uniforms cut in english and french style although ranks were still worn on the cuffs the addition of trouser stripes helped with immediate identification the full dress uniform was introduced in 1873 with nine gold buttons and a single gold stripe ranks were displayed on the cuffs collar shoulder straps and the indent of the hat many officers had begun carrying european style sabers rather than traditional japanese blades at this time the army did not differentiate between dress uniforms formal uniforms and service uniforms merely adding or removing decoration depending on the occasion the japanese military adopted a modified dark blue single breasted uniform in 1886 this uniform was standard by the time the first sino-japanese war broke out in 1895 when japan stamped its authority over east asia wrestling regional authority away from china and seizing control of taiwan and korea this uniform was retained with only minor modifications until 1905 by the time of the boxer rebellion when japan joined its european peers to defeat a chinese anti-imperialist uprising japanese soldiers had adopted the tradition of wearing senian bari or the 1000 stitch over their uniforms this was a red sash belt believed to confer good luck courage and immunity from wounds upon the wearer given by japanese women to soldiers going away to war officers meanwhile wore a longer double-breasted version of the typical tunic they wore a gold stripe to indicate rank with an additional red stripe to demonstrate higher status such as for field or company officers the russo-japanese war saw an asian nation win victory over a european power for the first time it also saw the imperial japanese army adopt a brand new khaki version of the 1886 uniform with the japanese quickly understanding the utility of khaki over blue it was designated in either cotton or surge for hot and cold weather respectively japan played a small role in the first world war capturing german possessions in the pacific to assist its ally britain japanese soldiers wore the new type 45 uniform in yellow brown featuring a flat topped peaked cap and tunic collars with red swallow-tailed gorget patches 1918 brought in a change of measurements not just in uniform sizes but also in the scale of japanese imperial ambitions as the first world war ended japanese forces intervened in siberia to secure its position in east asia in an ultimately fruitless attempt to see off the threat of communism as the russian civil war unfolded the japanese soldiers who began their nation's imperialist expansion into china were the m90 uniform introduced in 1930 these were predominantly made of wool with mustard colored tunics and trousers and olive drab caps all worn with hobnail marching boots made from cowhide or pigskin as the second world war erupted the imperial japanese army's new standard uniform was the m98 which was largely identical to the m90 that came before it there were key differences however the m98 was made of cotton instead of wool and was colored olive or khaki it featured a turned down collar upon which rank badges were carried replacing the shoulder rank badges of the m90 the taishin shudan paratroopers were the first during the battle of palambing on sumatra well organized and well-equipped these troops wore uniforms reminiscent of german luftwaffe paratroopers with padded leather helmets and extra ammunition in addition to standard infantry equipment japanese air power was crucial to the war effort against the united states as an integral part of the imperial japanese army pilots wore the standard army uniform only flying personnel and ground crews wore sky blue trim and stripes [Music] the imperial guard was based in japan throughout the war on the field they were distinguished by a wreathed star in bronze worn on the headgear in contrast to the plane star worn by other units the guard was involved in a number of notorious war crimes during the conflict as well as the attempted military coup d'etat that sought to prevent the emperor's surrender in august 1945. as the war progressed the japanese military was beset by supply problems many soldiers continued to wear the older m90 uniforms as too few m98 uniforms were produced to fully equip the army the m98s they did have were produced with cheaper materials than before their firearms too were increasingly produced crudely at so-called last ditch or substitute standards to cut costs and speed up production times officers uniforms were privately purchased and tailored to each individual so there was some variance from one officer to another unlike ordinary ranks officers were known to wear riding breeches with a full cut rather than trousers and had double-breasted overcoats with their rank displayed clearly on the column in 1945 these would be the last stand officers of the imperial japanese army that august japan surrendered to the allies and thereafter the japanese military was abolished in 1950 large portions of the u.s occupying forces were transferred to korea leaving japan only lightly defended the decision was then taken to establish a de facto military force under american supervision the national police reserve with khaki uniforms borrowed from the u.s army a short jacket a shirt and a tie in 1954 this nascent defense force was reorganized into the japan self-defense forces but began with its uniforms remaining as hand-me-downs from the us military in 1965 the modern japan self-defense force finally introduced its first camouflage pattern called type 1 kunai camouflage the design featured black brown and green woodland shapes on a pale green background and was initially issued to members of the first airborne brigade it saw widespread use in the 1980s and lasted until 1991. japan was a key ally of the united states during the cold war representing one of its most important military relationships in that period in the 1970s a new dress uniform was introduced brown single-breasted four button suits with cherry blossom insignia on the capped badge these remained in use until the 1990s based on the german army's flectarn japan's second camouflage pattern features black brown and green dots on a khaki background it has been referred to as ga thai after the japanese name for the self-defense forces japan's first foreign military deployment since the end of the second world war was not without controversy however these forces were deployed to iraq for strictly humanitarian and reconstruction work and were forbidden from entering active combat zones japan's special operations group based primarily off the us army's own special forces groups was tasked as the security detail for the relief deployments commander 2018 witnessed another milestone the first marine force since the second world war this new amphibious warfare unit has been equipped with the new type 16 uniform a redesigned service dress today the japanese self-defense forces are a well-organized modern military force but its future is uncertain a fierce debate rages about its role in the

the successful campaigns in north africa and sicily but were quickly dashed during the invasion of mainland italy which had been intended to open an easy route straight to germany's doorstep although initially termed the soft underbelly of europe by winston churchill progress had come to an abrupt halt at the heavily fortified gustav line and hitler's veteran troops were showing no signs of retreat or surrender frustrated by this lack of progress allied planners had finally gotten the green light to open their second front after years of careful deliberation the invasion of normandy codenamed overlord was finally commencing the allied units involved in the operation consisted of the american first army and the british second army under the overall command of dwight d eisenhower each army was assigned to one or more of the five normandy landing sites codenamed utah omaha gold sword and juno over 140 000 men would be involved in the initial attack which was set to hit all beaches simultaneously in the early hours of june 5th however due to poor weather conditions the invasion was launched on june 6th the commonwealth forces landing at gold juno and sword beaches were tasked with capturing kong an important rail and road hub as well as the nearby copycat airfield further west the american forces would be faced with a bloody struggle for the possession of beaches omaha and utah their objective was to isolate the kutanta peninsula which contained the vital port city of cherbourg facing every landing army were the formidable defenses of the atlantic wall which had thus far proved almost immune to allied air raids and was manned by roughly 50 000 german soldiers although a naval bombardment two hours prior to the landings had managed to crash open a few of the german bunkers a number of heavy guns remained intact and opened fire on the approaching landing craft the men aboard the landing craft could only grit their teeth as 88 millimeter shells splashed around them the allies had equipped a number of tanks with canvas skirts so they could be dropped in shallow waters ahead of the infantry but the six-foot waves rendered these modifications almost useless their transports ended up having to dash for the shore and dump precious cargo directly onto the sand with several sunk by enemy fire and underwater obstacles in the process despite all these setbacks british soldiers rushed the entrenched german positions equipped with nothing but their small arms even though mg-42s shredded whole platoons as they disembarked the germans were unable to repel the armored vehicles that had started to make it ashore it was one of these vehicles that finally silenced the deadly 88 millimeter gun that had been firing all morning between the two british sites was juno beach where the canadians would have a chance to prove they were more than just america's polite neighbor shallow reefs and minefields made landing difficult and the nearby coastal villages were heavily fortified however while sustaining heavy casualties the brave men of the canadian 3rd infantry division broke through the german defenses and secured juno by mid-afternoon having achieved their initial objective the third division linked up with british forces from gold beach and pushed inland further fracturing the disorganized german line us forces meanwhile were not having as much luck from the very moment their landings began at 6 30 things started to go wrong the amphibious tanks that were sent along with the first wave of infantry could not handle the heavy seas and only 2 out of 29 even made it to the beaches a lack of heavy armament meant the infantry could not easily advance and many were slaughtered as they attempted to cross the barren stretch of sand between the shore and the enemy bunkers omaha beach was the largest to be stormed on d-day and the poor weather conditions meant that men often waded ashore only to find themselves in the completely wrong landing zone with nowhere to hide these confused soldiers were forced to form ad-hoc units and simply press forwards toward the nearest source of enemy fire their greater objectives forgotten in the chaos of the moment looming over the american landing zones was la pointa a 100 foot or 30 meter tall promontory that housed a network of german bunkers and as many as six massive 155 millimeter case-mated guns while men crawled through the sand below soldiers of the second and fifth army ranger battalions conducted a valiant assault on the enemy stronghold the first rangers reached the clips at 7 10 am and began to scale them using the remaining ladders and grafton launchers enemy resistance was fierce but the rangers persevered systematically clearing the bunkers until they reached the huge casemates where the 155 millimeter guns were located [Music] only then did they discover the futility of their operation both guns were missing removed days earlier after they proved to be a magnet for allied bombing runs in total the 225 man assault force left nearly half of their number lying dead or wounded their heavy casualties as much the fault of allied intelligence as anything else at 8 30 am the first german counter-attack struck omaha now the most heavily contested of the five landing zones several more would follow throughout the day with the most successful occurring around 4 pm when the 21st panzer division the only armored unit in the range of the coastline at the time rocketed through the vulnerable corridor between juno and sword this was without any exaggeration the worst case scenario no matter how many troops the allies had landed they still lacked the firepower to deal with this new threat unfortunately for the germans this counter-attack would be foiled by various factors which the allies had been manipulating in anticipation of d-day before we continue to the action let's pull back a bit and explore a few of these ruses in april 1944 allied planes began an intense bombing campaign against german positions in france with the luftwaffe occupied in the east allied aircraft outnumbered their axis counterparts by more than thirty to one allied aviators successfully damaged coastal artillery emplacements and airfields as well as rail bridge and road networks frequently used by the wehrmacht however the allied bombing campaign was as much about misdirection as it was about destruction operation fortitude was designed to convince the germans that the allies would land in northeastern france as part of the even larger operation bodyguard fortitude involved false diplomatic communications false news stories and the manipulation of known double agents the allies even constructed an entire decoy army near dover known as the first united states army group this fictional formation was led by none other than general george i slapped the ptsd out of my soldiers patton as a result the axis wasted valuable time and resources fortifying positions near the pod clay and even as far away as the coast of norway men of the 21st panzers found themselves standing alone and unsupported as the singular armored division available during d-day german field marshal evan rommel had foreseen this possibility and had argued that all 10 panzer divisions in france be stationed as close to the coastline as possible ultimately the divisions were split up all over france but deception alone wasn't enough for the allies troops needed to be inserted behind enemy lines just prior to the landings in order to further disrupt the german response the only way to do this was via air drops despite the risk one british and two american airborne divisions were scheduled to drop on the morning of the invasion as they approached their drop zones the c-47 dakota transport planes of the american 101st and 82nd airborne divisions found themselves subject to unexpectedly heavy anti-aircraft fire thanks to this flack many paratroopers ended up scattered across normandy however enough men landed in their intended zones to prevent the arrival of german reinforcements british paratroopers were responsible for capturing two heavily defended bridges which they held against repeated attacks from german tanks and artillery one location was later renamed pegasus bridge after the shoulder emblem of the british paratroopers who captured it and held it during d-day members of the 101st and 82nd divisions also destroyed or captured several other bridges in the normandy area further delaying the german response [Music] as d-day drew to its bloody clothes thousands of allied soldiers lay dead with precious little to show for their sacrifices although they had pushed several miles inland only gold and juno beaches had linked up successfully the other beaches especially omaha were still very exposed optimistic allied planners had assumed that by now several towns would be under siege and the kutonta peninsula would be on the verge of isolation the reality was that the allies had failed to achieve any of these objectives and could not hope to hold the beaches against a determined assault the counter-attack by the 21st panzer division had been particularly devastating as it prevented forces from sword and juno beaches from linking up thwarting the allied thrust towards calm but as we mentioned before several factors foiled this assault the primary one being allied air superiority which annihilated the german armored columns forcing them back from the beaches after a week spent scrounging up men and materiel british forces attempted an armored assault on the small town of viller bokage but were driven back to make matters worse resupply efforts were hampered by storms that prevented the deployment of artificial harbors two weeks later british reinforcements launched operation epsom with the aim of finally capturing kong which was now being defended by a full eight panzer divisions including two battalions of deadly tiger tanks thanks to this massive concentration of german armor the british were repulsed on june 30th after achieving only modest gains these repeated failures caused tension at allied headquarters especially surrounding bernard montgomery who conceived of epsom this wouldn't be his last blunder on the western front at this point the germans were also suffering from their own supply shortages with the war in the east taking priority above all else many of the 60 or so divisions of army group b stationed in northern france were severely under strength and lacked heavy equipment any attempts to mask the panzers into a decisive force were foiled by allied bombardment and sabotaged by the french resistance meant that german communications were unreliable at best the americans in particular benefited from this situation and spent the rest of the month besieging the port city of cherbourg capturing it on june 29th unfortunately the german garrison had sabotaged the port and filled the harbor with mines rendering it unusable until late august meaning that the allies still didn't have a functioning port to bring in adequate reinforcements and supplies over in the east the canadians finally captured the copycat airfield on july 9th however the british were unable to capitalize on this success and spent most of july banging their heads against the defenses of call to no avail while progress was slow on the eastern side of normandy over in the west the americans began to work their way west taking the solo heights just a day after the desert fox's unlucky brush with a fighter plane though the combat was brutal the americans ultimately prevailed and their success set the stage for the final breakout from normandy operation cobra on july 25th allied air support began performing danger close missions against fortified german positions outside cherbourg although highly controversial the results spoke for themselves and the german left flank swiftly began to withdraw the ensuing allied advance was slow due to the american forces having to push through fields sewed with a bountiful crop of german landmines just waiting for the tread of an allied boot by this point in the invasion hedgerow warfare was becoming a fact of life normandy was covered by thick dense hedges that served mostly to divide up sections of farmland often over 5 meters or 16 feet tall they provided excellent cover for german infantry disrupting lines of fire and turning simple fields into miniature fortresses that had to be cleared out one by one at great cost to the attackers but despite the nightmare that was the french countryside the americans pushed south and reached avonsh by july 30th with allied forces moving into brittany the germans still defending call were in danger of encirclement but before they could retreat the infamous july plot occurred this plot was an attempt by several top-ranking german officers to assassinate hitler and sue for peace with the allies evan rommel had supposedly sympathized with some of the plotters and his involvement was revealed when it collapsed on july 20th as a result he was forced to take his own life deeply mistrustful of his remaining generals hitler took charge of the situation in normandy himself and demanded an immediate counter-attack by this time the american spearhead was being led by the newly arrived third army george patton now in charge of real soldiers captured britney in the first week of august at this time the germans were busy putting together a heavy assault force consisting of two regular and two ss panzer divisions these were intended to cut a suave through u.s forces behind the spearhead splitting up the leading elements and allowing the third reich to achieve a good old-fashioned encirclement had the vermost successfully hidden this force they might have actually pulled it off but few axis plans stayed secret in 1944 when the panzers attacked on august 7th they were met with a devastating ambush by allied anti-tank units seizing the opportunity to meet up with patton's forces montgomery's forces in normandy began a new offensive to the west of kong in just a few short days the tables had turned and the forces initially meant to encircle the allies now found themselves the victim of an identical maneuver despite his best efforts to throw the allies back into the channel hitler slowly began to accept the situation in france and finally approved of a retreat as the allied forces converged it became clear that the only chance for the survival of the two german armies in normandy was an escape through phallaes held by a single polish armored division outnumbered the polish fought valiantly and although they failed to stop the full german retreat they successfully contained nearly 50 000 german prisoners and forced the germans to abandon most of their heavy equipment this was a decisive moment there was no longer any question of allied superiority in northern france normandy had fallen and the road to paris lay open but before we discuss paris let's not let operation overlord completely overshadow another massive battle that was brewing on the western front the invasion of southern france also known as operation dragoon [Music] this had originally been meant to coincide with overlord and both were topics of discussion during the terran conference of 1943 attended by all three allied leaders churchill stalin and roosevelt stalin had been enthusiastic about these plans while churchill fervently believed that allied resources would be put to better use invading the balkans to link up with soviet forces and prevent a communist monopoly in eastern europe ultimately the discussion was settled when franklin d roosevelt agreed with stalin that the time had come for a cross-channel operation overlord was subsequently greenlit but dragoon would be shelved for the time being due to logistical concerns however the plan was revisited after storms destroyed the artificial harbor at omaha beach which combined with the sabotage of cherbourg created a massive backlog in allied shipping as a result the capture of such ports as marseille and toulon suddenly became the clearest solution to the logistical crisis in the north although churchill remained vehemently opposed to the idea general charles dugal threw his support behind it this operation would require a large-scale amphibious invasion involving over a half a million men and would later be reinforced by the free french by contrast german forces occupying southern france consisted of just 11 divisions under army group g the three beaches chosen for the initial landings were designated alpha delta and camel before the invasion began the southern branch of the french resistance began a large-scale campaign of sabotage and guerrilla warfare unlike the scattered opposition it had been during the early stages of the occupation the resistance in 1944 was now operating as a paramilitary force officially recognized as the french forces of the interior or ffi with the help from allied commandos the ffi blew up bridges cut power lines jammed communications and attacked isolated german units three french commandos were also tasked with silencing the artillery perched atop the daunting 107 meter or 350 foot high cliffs on the mainland known as operation romeo this raid involved 800 men the attack was a major success with the commandos killing or capturing about a thousand enemy soldiers while sustaining only a few dozen casualties themselves this was all merely a prelude to the landings themselves which took place on august 15th [Music] german soldiers were jolted from their bunks by the sudden scream of air raid sirens as they scrambled for their gear the first bombs began to drop shaking the ground and shattering their hardened concrete bunkers there was no escape thousands of bombers clogged the skies their pilots relishing in the near-complete air superiority possessed by the allies a full-scale naval bombardment followed with artillery shells up to 14 inches in diameter raining down on the stunned germans although the barrage eased as the transports neared their landing zones few defenders were willing to take advantage of the reprieve alpha and delta beaches fell with minimal resistance but camel beach held out stubbornly it was the most heavily defended beach and throughout repeated shelling and bombing one section remained defiant successfully resisting allied landings until it could be flanked by troops from other zones many hard lessons had been learned after the 10 000 casualties on d-day and ultimately the allies would pay a toll of only 700 dead or wounded for their passage across the mediterranean despite this initial success the invasion had only just begun on the morning after the landings four german battalions staged a two-pronged counter-attack although there was fierce fighting the offensive was doomed by low morale bad communication and a chronic shortage of heavy equipment the scattered remnants of the german forces were eventually forced to retreat leaving the allies free to pour ashore [Music] commanders now accepted that their positions were unsalvageable after consultation with the fuhrer a withdrawal order was given for army group g but all defensible locations within french territory were to remain manned and resist as long as possible this uncharacteristic retreat caught the allies by surprise in response the ad hoc task force butler was thrown together and doggedly pursued army group g hundreds of miles inland in an ironic twist of faith allied armor now sped ahead of the main advance just as the panzers had during the invasion of france less than five years prior back in the north a similar event was taking place as german field marshal walter model orchestrated the withdrawal of army group b model had already proved himself a skilled defensive strategist on the eastern front and his rear guard actions in france would enable some 240 000 soldiers to escape into belgium thanks to this most of army group g withdrew in good order resuming in southern france the allies continued to advance and besiege the few fortified pockets of access resistance left in the region on august 18th they surrounded the headquarters of the german 62nd port after days of constant harassment by the french forces of the interior the exhausted german soldiers surrendered but not before a single breakout attempt meanwhile french forces assaulted marseille and toulon held by just two german divisions as the french were besieging the cities in the south the allied forces in the north were faced with a dilemma paris was just over the horizon but it was still held by a german garrison as allied forces inched their way towards the city the french people rose up in a large-scale uprising on the 19th at first german military governor dietrich van coltez attempted to quell the unrest and keep the city open for resisting german forces though he accomplished the former it was clear that his time was up when the free french second armored division arrived five days later hitler then ordered koltitz to raise the city instead he surrendered it to the allies soon after general charles dugal led a massive three-day long parade throughout the city the provisional government of france was finally back on home soil and french military affairs would now be run directly from the capital within another month almost all of france would be liberated with german resistance contained to just a few tiny pockets along the coastline however the german reich was far from capitulation field marshal modal's efforts had paid off and hundreds of thousands of battle-hardened german troops now patiently awaited the next major advance at the ziegfried line this vast defensive work would be the equal of the atlantic wall with some sections resisting the allies right up to the collapse of the nazi regime in 1945 in the middle of hertkin forest a panzer grenadier crouches behind cover as a convoy of american tanks rumbles down the nearby road while he waits the soldier entertains himself with thoughts of the slaughter a mighty tiger tank could have unleashed against these vulnerable shermans but the p-47s swarming overhead have kept the tigers at bay as the enemy convoy reaches the crossroads he worries that his plan may be foiled but the armored column chooses the left route and the ambush begins as he surveys the carnage the soldier feels a sharp thrill of exaltation he has just proven that though wounded and limping the german wolf still has its teeth in early september 1944 the allied advance into western europe had reached a critical phase although france had been liberated many obstacles still littered the path to ultimate victory the logistical issues that had plagued the campaign since d-day were still frustrating allied quartermasters leaving four divisions dangerously undersupplied and ill-equipped to continue their rapid advance into nazi-occupied territory the german army meanwhile had been able to retreat swiftly and unbroken and was now busy fortifying key strategic locations in preparation for its final stand the main problem faced by the invading force was the lack of intact infrastructure while tremendously successful at the time the bombing campaigns over france now manifested themselves in the form of broken railways burnt out supply depots and roads cratered beyond use supply sent via the mediterranean theater would not be available until the two army groups in france finally converged on the 12th forcing logistics officers to improvise with systems like the famous red ball express this was a truck convoy that at its peak utilized nearly 6 000 vehicles many of which were commandeered from divisions newly arrived in france but this was merely a stop-gap measure and it was clear that new shorter supply routes back to britain had to be opened in an effort to address this critical issue the 21st army group consisting mostly of british and canadian soldiers was tasked with the liberation of the netherlands starting with the enormous port facilities of antwerp built on the banks of the scout etuary the city was poorly defended and seemed like the next logical target but when the british rolled in on the 4th of september they discovered almost the entire german 15th army digging in on an island located right at the mouth of the river as it turned out adolf hitler was well aware of antwerp's strategic value and had declared it and other port cities feshtom or fortresses that were to resist until the last man with the push to open the northern ports stalled by staunch resistance and worsening weather conditions endangering the makeshift harbors still packed to capacity in normandy allied high command was faced with a serious dilemma general eisenhower believed that maintaining momentum across the widest front possible was worth the risk of supply shortages he reasoned that while his enemies were still able to concentrate forces in key locations their ability to defend against an assault across the entire front line had been severely compromised due to a lack of manpower bernard montgomery on the other hand was convinced that this approach would doom the campaign and insisted on scraping together what resources they had and making a concentrated thrust towards berlin itself after much deliberation montgomery finally convinced an extremely reluctant eisenhower to divert men and resources away from the push on antwerp and instead launched the infamous operation market garden which saw over 34 000 airborne troops dropped over the netherlands making it the largest airborne assault of the whole war on september 17th men of the 101st 82nd and 1st airborne divisions departed on transport planes from england headed straight into nazi-occupied territory their objective was to secure a number of key bridges and strategic waypoints behind enemy lines once these targets had been captured the british would try forward an armored spearhead linking up with all three divisions theoretically putting them within striking distance of the roar valley germany's industrial heartland unfortunately for the attackers hitler had recently recalled garrett van roonstedt from retirement and appointed him as commander-in-chief of the western front replacing valtter modal this appointment was supported by mortal himself who recognized the value of having the reich's most experienced senior officer overseeing his activities with roonstead organizing the war in the west on a strategic level modal was free to employ his talents on the front lines as a direct result of their collaboration axis forces were almost perfectly positioned to turn operation market garden into a disaster for their unsuspecting foes from the moment allied boots hit the ground resistance was heavy while some paratroopers captured their targets with minimal difficulty others blundered straight into the two ss panzer divisions that had been stationed in the area to rest and recuperate and when british armor advanced it came under heavy fire from opposing artillery and then became bogged down in a protracted struggle for the town of nijmegen bad weather conditions in england also prevented many of the reinforcement drops leaving the paratroopers outnumbered and under-equipped model was even able to obtain a plan of the operation from a crashed allied glider giving him critical insight into the enemy's order of battle [Music] with enemy reinforcements pouring into the area montgomery was forced to concede that his plan had failed market garden would go down in history as having been mismanaged on almost every level the bad news didn't stop there however with resources diverted to the operation all pressure had been taken off of the german 15th army which was now fully prepared for any assault on the 2nd of october that attack came when 135 000 brave souls from the first canadian army finally began their brutal and protracted battle for the control of the scout conditions were nightmarish in addition to dealing with terrible weather high winds and the hellish obstacle course of canals ditches and dikes the canadians also had to contend with minefields and booby traps planted by the defenders progress was extremely slow but sheer desperation pushed the canadians onwards through the perilous mud and freezing waters of the scout while the fight for control of antwerp was ongoing montgomery's 21st army group was also trying to shore up the small salient created during operation market garden which resulted in an 18-day struggle centered on the village of oberlone they also undertook operation pheasant on the 20th of october which aimed to liberate further areas of the netherlands from elements of the 15th army further south u.s forces had spent most of september advancing to the siegfried line also known as the west wall this enormous defensive network consisted of nearly 22 000 bunkers and stretched from the netherlands all the way to the border of switzerland initially seen as little more than a folly designed to keep german construction companies busy during the economic boom of the late 1930s the west wall had seen heavy upgrades since the first landings in normandy tens of thousands of forced laborers had been put to work expanding existing defenses digging trenches tunnels and anti-tank ditches on october 2nd it would be tested by more than 100 000 american troops at the city of achen one of the most heavily defended on the siegfried line as u.s forces approached the nazi officials in charge of the city fled only to be unceremoniously seized as deserters and shipped off to the eastern front as privates in an act of desperation the general in charge of achen's defense gert van send a letter of capitulation to the americans this was promptly intercepted and handed straight to hitler needless to say garrett was also arrested and replaced despite these developments the americans besieged achen on the 2nd of october and quickly became bogged down in some of the bloodiest urban action of the entire offensive during the 19-day battle a hundred thousand men trudged grimly through the narrow maze-like streets of achen enduring constant ambushes from the 13 000 defenders bolstered by the thousands of volksderm or people's storm militia american soldiers quickly came to regard the sprawling ruined city as a malevolent entity in its own right and were reluctant to venture into the unexplored areas for fear of being slaughtered by hidden pillboxes or picked off by snipers when sherman tanks rolled into the streets ahead of the infantry they were repeatedly knocked out by german anti-tank guns all the while axis forces outside of the city launched repeated counter-attacks throwing themselves at the enemy with the unwavering determination of men defending their homeland as demoralizing as achin was for the allies it was arguably overshadowed by the unfolding disaster that was the fighting at perkin forest beginning weeks before the attack on achen this three-month-long battle was an attempt by the americans to breach the west wall south of the city in order to deny german reinforcements and take control of several water reservoirs which the enemy could potentially use to flood the region the initial advance went well with u.s soldiers traversing 6 miles or 9.6 kilometers of the west wall without difficulty then as the forest canopy closed in around them the nightmare began first came the minefields then acres of barbed wire then the camouflaged bunkers and artillery emplacements the dense tree line rendered allied air superiority meaningless and any tanks that rumbled into the forest were easy prey for even the lone infantrymen armed with panzerfausts meanwhile walter model was closely supervising defenses in the area deftly parrying each enemy thrust and launching localized counter-attacks whenever the opportunity arose south of achen general patton's third army had spent most of november trying and failing to capture mess in addition to a chronic lack of fuel and ammunition patton's men had to contend with a large river separating them from the city itself but even as the autumn rain poured down and enemy artillery thundered in the distance patton furiously whipped his men onwards when one of his subordinates begged him for a delay the fiery patent simply replied attack or name your replacement sadly however the siege of mess would drag on for another two months giving german forces in the south ample time to retreat to new defensive lines allied progress on the western front had all but come to a halt their swift advance was just a fond memory with fortress cities now presenting obstacles that could only be taken by prolonged sieges casualties were mounting and even veteran divisions were starting to waver in the face of such determined resistance there was no doubt that germany would be defeated but some commanders in the west were now wondering whether their victory was worth the price that they were paying from the german perspective roonstead and mortal were also aware that the war would end in defeat but they reasoned that by holding the west wall they could persuade the british and americans to sue for peace letting the reich concentrate its remaining forces on the soviets in the east unfortunately for the axis this tentative stalemate was about to be broken in the most spectacular fashion possible as fall began to end and winter began to close its icy grip on europe the exhausted canadian force that had spent almost a month and a half struggling for control of the scout finally broke the back of enemy resistance on november 8th although the minefields would not be cleared for another three weeks the invading forces finally had access to a deep water port in the north sea supply convoys would soon be streaming in delivering tons of vitally needed war materiel directly to the front lines but even as allied headquarters began to relax the cornered german wolf prepared itself for one last defiant snap at its hunters on the 16th of december allied soldiers stationed in the ardennes region awoke to the thunderous sound of an artillery barrage at least 1500 enemy guns were firing simultaneously their bombardment rolling up and down an 80 mile or 130 kilometer wide section of the front as soon as the fire stopped the ground troops surged forward the allies had stationed some 80 thousand men in the ardennes and it soon became clear that they were completely outnumbered division after division poured into the region spearheaded by one of the largest armored columns ever seen on the western front this relentless assault the last true example of the german blitzkrieg in the second world war was aimed directly at antwerp and the exhausted men of the british 21st army group if successful it would trap several hundred thousand troops behind its lines and end their enemies hopes of resupply via the north sea in addition to a massive conventional assault infiltration efforts by german commandos caused considerable chaos and paranoia in the enemy ranks in one famous incident american general omar bradley was arrested by a u.s military policeman after being asked to identify the capital of illinois he correctly answered springfield the policeman however thought it was chicago evidently having slept through his high school geography lessons although shattered by the initial onslaught allied forces in the ardennes quickly rallied forming isolated pockets of resistance that fought with incredible ferocity the panzer divisions had also begun the charge with less than half the fuel reserves needed to reach antwerp despite capturing nearly 50 000 extra gallons of fuel a day into the offensive many tanks were soon lying abandoned on the roadside never having fired a shot in the assault to make matters worse for the wehrmacht their enemies began destroying bridges and emptying fuel depots as they retreated leaving nothing of value behind by the 24th the german salient had reached the moose river creating a bulge in the allied lines roughly 45 miles or 72 kilometers deep but if hitler was looking for a christmas miracle his hopes were dashed when ax's forces were bottlenecked at the only bridges across the moose and the weather turned against them thus far the attackers had operated under heavy fog high winds and snow storms helping to conceal their movements but on the 23rd the clouds suddenly lifted and were swiftly replaced by swarms of fighters and bombers allied cargo planes also began dropping vital supplies to isolated pockets although the weather allowed allied planners to take to the skies once more on the 23rd they also allowed the luftwaffe to enter the fray operation borden plata or base plate was its last major operation of the war launched in an effort to the invaders air power in the lowlands the assault seemed remarkably successful at first with hundreds of planes destroyed on the ground but while the allies had the industrial capacity to replace these aircraft almost immediately the luftwaffe had no reserves left as german historian werner gerbig wrote borden plata dealt the luftwaffe a mortal blow and sealed its fate what happened from then on was no more than a dying flicker a dying flicker is an apt description of the reich's operations as a whole from this point on on the 26th forces under general patton's command thundered into the ardennes from the south smashing through enemy lines and ending any german hopes of reaching antwerp finally the last axis offensive in the west operation nordvind began on the very last day of the year 1944. as the ground froze solid axis forces threw themselves forward in one last desperate attempt to rest victory from defeat the line bent but did not break and hitler finally authorized a retreat on the 7th of january fighting in the region continued for another three weeks the allied advance was slow due to the abnormally harsh winter of 1944 montgomery was also reluctant to commit british forces to the counter-attack allowing roonstead to organize an effective retreat though at the cost of almost an entire mechanized force the human cost of the battle of the bulge was staggering exact figures are disputed but had a minimum 63 000 axis and 89 000 allied soldiers were killed captured or wounded during the frigid struggle for the ardennes region by now the walls were truly closing in in the east the vast soviet war machine ground steadily onwards with more than two million men marching closer to berlin by the day with the luftwaffe now a shadow of its former self german cities were subject to constant air raids the americans striking during the day and the british bombing at night on february 3rd a devastating air raid was conducted on berlin deploying more than 1600 aircraft to obliterate large sections of the city in a single night dresden would also be all but wiped off the map in a series of four air raids that took place between the 13th and the 15th with no fear of further enemy offensives the allies could now afford to advance methodically clearing out the last pockets of enemy resistance on the east bank of the great rhine river while many sections of the siegfried line still held the static nature of the defenses meant that once a breakthrough was achieved the attackers could simply bypass any remaining fortifications and continue their advance unopposed on the 7th of march a u.s armored division sped ahead of the main advance and captured the ludendorff bridge which the germans were already attempting to demolish after driving away the saboteurs the americans defended the bridge against a series of increasingly desperate counter-attacks although it would finally collapse after weeks of bombardment by artillery five divisions were able to cross the rhine and push deeper into germany the diversion also allowed engineers to set up other temporary bridges across the river practically undisturbed in all the unexpected seizure of ludendorff bridge accelerated the allied advance by three weeks or more as for the men who had defended germany so successfully just months before garrett von runstad would be dismissed from command in early march walter model architect of so many of the reich's defensive victories fell out of hitler's favor after the battle of the bulge and had much of his command autonomy revoked denied anything but to hold position mortal could only watch helplessly as enemy forces began crossing the rhine from the north and south finally entering the rohr valley and completely encircling his forces on the 1st of april seeing his position as hopeless and not wanting to violate his military honor by surrendering mortal quietly ordered his remaining troops to disband then committed suicide with german defenses collapsing everywhere it was only a matter of time before capitulation occurred in the end western allied forces did not even make a concerted push towards berlin which was certain to end up in soviet hands instead they continued to focus on eisenhower's broad front strategy pushing outwards in all directions to isolate and contain the last pockets of dedicated nazi resistance in fact the main limiting factor to their advance was now the vast hordes of prisoners they were having to support every day with more than 300 000 taken during the collapse of the roar pocket alone organized german resistance rapidly broke down and by now their manpower reserves were virtually non-existent in the last few days of the third reich more old men women and young boys were defending the fatherland than there were professional soldiers on april 30th with berlin completely surrounded by an endless horde of soviet soldiers adolf hitler finally chose to end his life many other senior nazi officers would follow suit leaving grand admiral carl donates now in command to order a german surrender given the fractured nature of their forces at this point some isolated units continued to resist for days after the official surrender refusing to believe their country had fallen in spite of the overwhelming war machine the nazi party had mobilized both in terms of materiel and men hitler's thousand-year reich died at just 12 years old more brutal combat awaited in the pacific but in europe the war had come to an end the surrender was officially signed on may 8. although the european theater was at a close there still remained work to be done large swaths of europe needed to be reconstructed and the millions who had been displaced required immediate attention above all else the national socialist ideology had to be eradicated from the defeated german nation in order to prime america's next new ally revitalizing europe would take decades and ultimately set the stage for the coming conflict between the two rising global superpowers the united states and the soviet union [Music] thanks again to our sponsor call of war enjoy rewriting

armchair historian in the early days of direct american involvement in the vietnam war strategists planned to use their growing air capabilities to overcome the challenges of operating in the jungles of vietnam these innovative tactics were put to the test for the first time in the battle of iadram when a u.s air mobile division fought to push back an assault by the b-3 front of the north vietnamese army on the strategically vital central highlands in the bloody struggle that followed both sides would ultimately achieve a form of victory while the americans accomplished most of their objectives the battle revealed vulnerabilities in their air mobile tactics which their tenacious enemies were quick to exploit in this video we will look at how the battle of yadrang set the stage for

united states was rapidly becoming more and more involved in the ongoing conflict between the democratic republic of vietnam in the north and the republic of vietnam in the south fighting up to that point had largely been between the south vietnamese army or arvin assisted by cia militias known as the civilian irregular defense group or cidg and the vietcong an irregular army of communist insurgents supplied by the north vietnamese military or paving one hotly contested area was the central highlands region which served as a vital staging ground and base of operations for both the vietcong and regular forces the cidg had been struggling to seize control of the highlands for months and early 1965 saw american special forces begin taking a much more active role in the battle but as these professional troops took over from the militia the vietcong themselves began receiving heavy reinforcements from the pavin both sides saw the necessity of securing the highlands but it was the communist forces who would commit to the first large-scale offensive in july major general chu huiman assumed command over three regiments from the pavin first division and began planning an ambitious assault on the american military camp at playmay southwest of pleiku city initially operating as three separate groups one regiment would attack play may and pin the defenders down while a second lurked in ambush for any reinforcements once these had been dealt with the third regiment would arrive and all three would unite for a final assault on plaku city but just as general man's audacious plans began to take shape the americans threw a wrench into the works by deploying the first cavalry division to the central highlands this was the first complete us division to enter vietnam and mon immediately realized that if they were allowed to reach play camp his offensive would be doomed before it even began concluding that only decisive action could prevent a swift american victory general man rushed to prepare his troops for an assault in mid-october nearly three whole months sooner than anticipated but by that point only two of his three regiments were ready to fight even so with forward elements of the first cavalry division already arriving in playmay mom decided to roll the dice and proceed with the operation the playmate camp came under fire on the evening of october 19th with mon's 33rd regiment quickly overrunning an outpost to the south and assaulting the camp by around 1am cabin forces had pushed to the perimeter of the main camp but the defenders held firm and repelled the advancing troops around this time american captain harold m moore took control of the camp's defense after playmate's arvin commander allegedly disappeared into a bunker soon after the attacks began moore immediately called for air support and from around 4 am onward the us 481st tactical fighter squadron unleashed a continuous barrage of airstrikes that would last for the remainder of the siege inflicting considerable casualties on the attackers over the next four days the americans continued to exchange fire with the 33rd regiment who were sheltering in improvised fortifications in a wide arc to the west of playmate with neither side able to gain the upper hand on october 23rd several arvin units under general winfo wing lock set out to relieve their american allies just as planned the pavin 32nd regiment ambushed the relief column on the way to the camp fighting viciously into the night before the vietnamese troops were forced to pull back and return to their hq the pavin ambush succeeded in delaying the relief forces and inflicting heavy casualties but by the night of october 25th the south vietnamese column had reached playmate and broken the siege having failed in their attempt to overrun the americans at play may the 32nd and 33rd regiments were forced to retreat to their headquarters further north the u.s commanders were eager to pursue their fleeing foes hoping to put their newly devised air mobility tactics to good use and so in close coordination with air support units seven sites throughout the central highlands were selected as landing zones for air mobile assault groups to stage their attacks by early november the plan was ready to proceed [Music] after some small skirmishes in the first weeks of november the american offensive began in ernst on november 14th the pavin 32nd and 33rd regiments had completed their retreat to fortified positions surrounding the chupang massif mountain south vietnamese intel suggested that a large portion of these positions were located throughout the nearby yadrang valley prompting the americans to prepare the 1st battalion 7th cavalry to deploy into the valley via a clearing designated landing zone x-ray the operation was saddled with logistics problems from the beginning due to a shortage of service-ready helicopters and a diminished carrying capacity of those that were available only 80 men could be delivered to the landing zone every half hour it would take roughly three hours to transport the full 431 troops of the first battalion leaving the first waves dangerously vulnerable while they waited for reinforcements even with these risks taken into account first battalion commander colonel harold hal moore no not that one approved the plan and the battle of ia drang commenced on the morning of november 14th preceded by colossal bombardments from howitzers gunships and aerial rockets the first elements of the 1st battalion were dropped into the valley at 10 48 am as the americans unloaded their equipment and established a perimeter one can only imagine their trepidation knowing their enemy could be watching their every move kalashnikov ready however the enemy in question was instead taken completely by surprise general man was overseeing a supply run away from the front and his deputy colonel ahn was forced to rush to the battlefield and take command on did not arrive until around 1 pm by which point his men had been haphazardly engaging the americans for hours and had taken many casualties bravo company had taken advantage of its enemies disorganization to advance up the slope of chupang masih pushing to within 100 meters of the pavin 9th battalion's concentration position before being pinned down by enemy fire as alpha company arrived in full to join the vanguard the u.s offensive was proceeding well and colonel moore was quite confident in his imminent victory so naturally the situation spiraled out of control in the next 30 minutes colonel ahn rallied his men and the americans suddenly faced a coordinated counter-attack from further up the mountain heavy mortar fire began to rain down on the lz and bravo company's second platoon was rapidly cut off and surrounded moore scrambled to respond to this sudden reversal of fortune redirecting elements of alpha company to rescue the lost platoon and desperately requesting further air support brutal fighting dragged on for the next two hours with both sides taking heavy casualties as the americans struggled to dislodge the dug in pavin from their defensive positions the volume of fire became so heavy that when the fifth helicopter lift arrived with fresh troops moore had to warn the pilots not to attempt a landing for fear of them being shot down the cut-off second platoon saw the worst of this brutal fighting as they struggled to hold their improvised perimeter against wave after wave of paving troops to make matters worse the platoon's commander was killed leaving sergeant clyde e savage to lead their desperate fight for survival none of the men sent to rescue the second platoon were able to reach them forcing savage and his soldiers to hold out on their own until well into the evening when pavin attacks finally ceased and the enemy began to withdraw even then the platoon remained trapped behind enemy lines cut off from any support specialist galen bungam a veteran of the second platoon later described his ordeal we gathered up all of the magazines we could find and stacked them in front of us there was no way we could dig a foxhole the handle was blown off my entrenching tool and one of my canteens had a hole blown through it the fire was so heavy that if you tried to raise up to dig you were dead there was death and destruction all around as the sun began to set and the fighting gradually died down colonel moore requested reinforcements to shore up 1st battalion's tenuous position these came in the form of an additional company under captain myron after doric with the help of the doric's men the weary soldiers established a defensive perimeter and dug in preparing to face a north vietnamese counter-attack the next morning meanwhile the pavin commanders were attempting to reorganize and rally their scattered forces colonel ahn had ordered the 66th regiment to launch a nighttime attack on the american line but the regiment's commissar lanak cho found fee tired and malnourished troops almost impossible to control no attack occurred that night as both sides licked their wounds in pitch darkness lit only by occasional flash of american shells exploding throughout the jungle the next day the americans received much-needed supplies and reinforcements to further shore up their position the pavin renewed their assaults early in the morning but they were largely held at bay by u.s air support this included repeating strafing runs by fighter jets but the more significant contribution came in the form of operation arclight a massive bombing campaign carried out by guam-based b-52 stratofortress strategic bombers these enormous planes were able to drop enough heavy ordnance on the enemy or rather on a vast area roughly around the enemy to prevent paving troops from launching any effective attacks on the american positions with the help of this shielding curtain of annihilation colonel moore was finally able to organize a rescue operation to recover the battered second platoon bringing them back to lz x-ray and evacuating their many many wounded however this security came at a cost the danger close ordinance the american planes were dropping included vast quantities of napalm and this deadly and imprecise weapon proved almost as dangerous to their own soldiers as to the enemy at one point moore's command post was struck by two napalm bombs killing or wounding several of his men meanwhile the pavin 66th regiment continued probing the americans defenses and trying to find a way through their aerial bombardment by the morning of november 16th these efforts had left the 66th all but shattered and colonel ahn ordered them to cease attacks on lz x-ray and withdraw once it became clear that the fighting was over the first battalion pulled back to a landing zone further from the front to be evacuated while the battle over lz x-ray was finished combat operations in the iadrang valley were still ongoing the next day november 17th the two battalions remaining at lz x-ray set off on foot toward two other lz's in the vicinity of the two sites one hosted an established defensible firebase while the other lz albany was an empty clearing much like lz x-ray the 2-7 battalion arrived in this vulnerable position around 1pm tired and demoralized from their long march through the dense jungle unfortunately for them the americans were not alone the 8th battalion of the pavin 66th regiment had spotted them on their trek and were waiting in ambush in the woods surrounding lz albany this time they made sure that the attack would be right in the face of the enemy preventing the use of air support as soon as the 2-7 entered the clearing a barrage of machine guns and mortar fire tore through the unit killing the closest soldiers before they even realized they were under attack the americans scrambled for cover focusing their defense on three large termite mounds their situation swiftly went from bad to worse when another paving battalion arrived to flank their improvised defenses concealed within the forest the north vietnamese soldiers unloaded everything they had on the beleaguered us battalion and their proximity meant the americans were unable to rely on the air and artillery support that had turned the tide at lz x-ray split into two separate pockets the 2-7 continued to hold out against the onslaught for the rest of the day bolstered by the timely arrival of reinforcements in the evening after nightfall the fighting turned into a nightmarish game of cat and mouse as paving soldiers spread out and scoured the battlefield looking for wounded or isolated american soldiers that they could finish off by the morning however it was over the pavement troops were exhausted and their supplies were almost fully depleted as the sun rose the north vietnamese retreated into the jungle leaving the 2-7 now reduced to less than half its previous strength in possession of the blood-soaked battlefield a handful more minor skirmishes occurred at other lz's in the valley in the following days but the battle of ia drang was over when all was said and done almost half of the 1000 us soldiers who participated in the battle became casualties with 237 killed and 258 wounded the pavin suffered heavier losses with around 1 000 killed and over 500 wounded of their original 2500 troops but this was a sacrifice they were willing to make the north vietnamese from that point on learned how to exploit u.s forces over reliance on air and artillery support by keeping their attack swift and close to the enemy man to man face to face [Music] while american forces were successful in repelling b3 front's attack on the camp at playmay and forcing them off the field many could not help but see it as a ferric victory the fiasco at lz x-ray proved that helicopter transports were of limited use in large-scale engagements disappointing those who had placed their hopes in an air mobility doctrine and even with overwhelming air superiority the ambush of the 2-7 proved that the people's army of vietnam was a force to be reckoned with the lessons learned by both sides at yajrang would go on to influence how they fought in the years of brutal war to come [Applause] [Music] you\",\n",

communists can barely feed themselves much less prisoners of war perhaps our soldier thinks he will soon join his former comrades who stare blankly at him from the pit hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian when ve day was declared in 1945 the allied powers held roughly 11 million german soldiers as prisoners of war the vast majority of these close to 8 million had been captured by the western allies while the remaining 3 million were in the custody of the soviet union with europe liberated from nazi aggression the allied powers were left with a critical question what to do with their 11 million pows the issue was a divisive one to say the least as while the western allies were signatories to the geneva convention which very clearly demanded the release of prisoners the moment the war ended the soviets had notably abstained from signing the international agreement this meant that a captured german soldier's fate was ostensibly decided by whose hands they fell into but war is a brutal business and sometimes even international law is just ink on a piece of paper in today's episode we will examine the various ends a german soldier could meet after 1945 as well as the fates of some of germany's war criminals if you hadn't guessed already war can be a stressful business soldiers on an extended tour of duty have to face many hardships but there is one that rarely

of 1945 the big three allied leaders president franklin delano roosevelt prime minister winston churchill and premier joseph stalin met at lavadia palace in crimea this yalta conference was meant to decide the ultimate fate of a defeated germany a key point of the agreement among the three men was that their foe must be brought to heal and rendered unable to threaten the world for a third time in addition to dividing germany into occupation zones and the idea of monetary reparations the big three agreed that the german people themselves must be made to physically repair the damage their nation had done to europe this included conscripting pows for forced labor a practice stalin and his advisors thought necessary and roosevelt and churchill regarded with tacit acceptance but more on that later [Music] during the war years german soldiers were imprisoned in roughly 20 countries around the world including in the continental united states while stateside many german prisoners were leased out to farms or factories to serve as laborers providing additional hands to make up for the workers lost to the draft a hotbed of this leasing activity was the southern us where german pows befriended american citizens and watched hollywood films during their off hours overall pows sent to the us were treated humanely and deaths of germans in american custody were low at 491. things were different in the internment camps in europe where american estimates for pows who died in custody lie in the low thousands while german tallies claim up to 40 000 fatalities in american custody the americans early release of many prisoners complicates attaining an exact number for their part the british empire managed the fate of up to 2.5 million german pows by the war's end germans kept in great britain could be housed in anything from tents set up in a pastoral field to elegant manor houses repurposed as surprisingly posh prisons similar to their comrades in the u.s german pows in britain enjoyed a cordial relationship with british civilians who gave them money and foods that they were not usually fed germans in britain could also be put onto a labor detail for which they were paid a respectable two shillings per day of work the number of german pows who died in british custody was 1254. british soldiers as well as american were also reported to have engaged in torture when interrogating germans suspected of committing war crimes often leading to confessions extracted under duress but this was far from the worst a german captured on the western front could expect that dubious dishonor lies with france german soldiers captured during the liberation of france as well as a number relocated there from american custody faced abysmal conditions and vengeful civilians french citizens would verbally harass or assault german prisoners stoning or beating them sometimes to death some pew camps seemed designed for extermination rather than detention a french camp in the saat gave its inmates only 900 calories worth of rations per day for comparison a jew living in the early days of the warsaw ghetto was on paper at least allotted just over 1 000 calories of rations by the nazis an average of 12 pows died daily at the assat camp and shortly after ve day the red cross reported that almost 200 000 german soldiers in french custody faced imminent starvation the united states was forced to halt any further shipments of pows to france and mandate their adherence to the geneva convention an act that in practice was largely symbolic the end of the war meant according to international law repatriation but for the western allies the end of the war largely seemed to mean reparation the us and britain leased roughly one million german pows to the french to rebuild their country while 64 000 went to belgium 10 000 to the netherlands and 5 000 to luxembourg germans on the continent would assist in reconstruction building roads or working in sawmills and quarries some in france and the netherlands were made to clear minefields two thousand pows were killed or maimed each month doing this conscripting the workers this way was a clear violation of the geneva convention but the western allies claimed that since the german government technically did not exist their charges were not prisoners of war and therefore were not entitled to the protections afforded to pows [Music] the soviets had suffered greatly in their war against fascism and they did not want a pound of flesh for their trouble they wanted tons soviet plans for post-war reconstruction included the use of german pows as forced labor as early as 1944. ivan maisky soviet ambassador to the british empire called for the germans to be given as reparations to the soviet union for a lengthy period which he ultimately defined as 10 years maeske would refine his proposal for the yalta conference and provided stalin with a full-scale plan to get the ussr a supply of 5 million german pows to be used as forced labor for a decade after victory was achieved with this mass conscription and the planned seizure of german land and wealth the soviets hoped they could keep the german people from ever fighting against the ussr again with the war's end and the carving of germany into occupation zones the soviet plans were put into effect soviet authorities began identifying their new charges with ethnic germans in soviet territory investigated to determine if they had served in the war any who had verifiable vermont service were ordered to soviet pow camps to be prepared for forced labor the soviets would organize their new workers into battalions of three to five thousand men divided into one thousand man companies they were primarily used for construction and heavy industry with a laser focus on rebuilding the utterly devastated soviet union three million germans would be drafted into the soviet labor companies a full third would die there it should be noted however that this may not have been the result of direct soviet action or negligence theirs was a war of annihilation where both german and soviet gave no quarter and expected none consequently a number of the men forced into these labor companies were pows captured by the soviets directly and due to the horrible conditions of the eastern front came into soviet custody malnourished sick utterly exhausted or some combination of the three but it would not have been pragmatic for the soviets to intentionally slaughter their newly acquired labor pool so shortly after a war that devastated their working population from 1945 to 1946 many pows who were too sick to work were simply released by the soviets rather than be worked to death a bad harvest and endemic corruption and mismanagement seemed to be behind the travails of german forest laborers in the early post-war years however as time wore on the german laborers began to prove more trouble than their soviet masters thought them worth pow labor was a surprisingly expensive enterprise and had to constantly be subsidized by the main soviet economy the germans contributed roughly 5 of the soviet union's total national income a far cry from the grand reparation envisioned by maeske and his 10 years of servitude in a surprisingly capitalist move soviet industrial leaders began to see their german workers as unprofitable and began to skimp on their responsibilities to feed and care for them after all why waste good money and materiel on what they saw as fascist parasites as their industrial managers began to sour on the concept soviet leaders began making moves toward repatriation in 1947 the foreign ministers of the allied powers agreed that they would repatriate all german pows by 1948. the soviet effort would last well into 1950 with roughly 26 000 german pows who had been convicted of war crimes by soviet courts not sent back to germany as late as 1956 overall germans in the soviet union after the war were faced with mandatory hard labor under challenging conditions but the majority were repatriated long before the initial plan of 10 years but one of germany's soldiers who had been discharged before the war's end or who had deserted their fuhrer's crusade against the rest of the world or who simply had been far enough away from the front lines that they were not captured those germans who escaped capture and who were in the western occupation zones found themselves cast adrift in a new germany the allies were keen to strip germany of any martial will and to this end of militarism of any military-inclined organization or club this meant that german veterans of the second world war unlike their former foes had no support system to help them transition back into civilian life these suddenly demobilized soldiers found themselves in a country gripped by denotification as the western allies sought to purge the influence of hitler and goebbel's propaganda machine and eliminate all traces of nazi ideology and war mongering to this end former soldiers were ordered to present themselves to allied tribunals for summary judgment originally run by the occupying forces before being handed off to german authorities in 1946 these tribunals would take stock of the defendant's military and civilian activities during the war the court would then categorize the defendant as a major offender offender lesser offender follower or give them a full exoneration by and large rank and file members of the vermost were categorized as lesser offenders and sentenced to a three-year period of probation during this time they were prohibited from holding public office or running their own businesses as more and more defendants were found or presented themselves the tribunal system began to buckle under an ever-growing caseload and judges began finding or making a multitude of exceptions to speed the process up disabled veterans were often exempted from judgment along with those who could prove that they were impoverished during the war years or were born after 1919 while this system succeeded in streamlining the process of former vermont personnel it allowed those with real nazi sympathies to slip through the cracks denotification was abandoned in the 1950s as its inefficiencies became more apparent and the german public began pushing back on the idea of individual culpability why reckon with your part in crimes against humanity when you can simply pin it all on a dead austrian painter and move on with your life in one of history's moments of irony many former vermont personnel judged by the allies for their service would soon find themselves right back in uniform with the growing threat of the soviets to the east the allied powers realized that a militarized germany would prove a keen ally should the world descend into another global conflict the bundeswehr was established in november of 1955 and many former vermont soldiers could be found in its ranks sometimes wielding the same weapons they used to fight against the allies the war criminals of nazi germany from the highest echelons of military and civilian leadership to rank-and-file guards were arraigned on charges of crimes against humanity and prosecuted at a series of trials most famously at nuremberg prosecutors from all allied nations presented a preponderance of evidence ranging from private diaries to ledgers of concentration camps to military dispatches the prosecution's point was clear the military was equally responsible for hitler's horrors as the ss and civilian leadership there was no distinction to be drawn between the independent and politically minded ss and the duly enlisted soldiers of the vermost while separate these two cogs in hitler's machine of annihilation would often work in sinister concert the vermont would take an area and the ss would purge it of undesirables military officers such as kaidel and high ministers like ribentrop were hanged while others were sentenced to prison terms ranging from life to time served others such as hermann goering took their own lives rather than face the hangman there were even a few female defendants such as the sadistic hyena of auschwitz emma creza kreza was ultimately hanged for her brutal treatment of concentration camp inmates unusual for a time when executing women was a stark rarity but these people were still allowed a defense and theirs was simple we were just following orders the thrust of these arguments was that any nazi soldier officer official or minister accused of crimes against humanity was simply following a directive from a higher authority some in fact falsified orders to show that they had no choice in the matter creating false paper trails to justify their own malice and cruelty toward jews roma lgbtq people and others the nazi party declared undesirable many of these false stories were pushed by the defendant's families who were tired of the war tired of the reckoning and just wanted their sons daughters husbands or wives home whether they were a monster or not this attitude began to pervade german public consciousness with unfortunate results in 1949 the federal republic of germany was founded a new german state for a new german people the first chancellor of this new germany conrad adenauer opened his tenure by announcing plans for a general amnesty for war criminals who had been sentenced by the occupying powers the desire for germany to be an ally against possible soviet aggression trumped the desire for justice and spring of 1950 saw the advisory board on clemency for war criminals established to review cases for leniency 105 cases were brought to the advisory board in august of 1950 as family and friends of convicted war criminals as well as representatives of the new german government presented all manner of mitigating evidence from medical history to the newly birthed clean vermont myth which stated emphatically that all nazi crimes were the fault of the ss and hitler's inner circle proponents of the clean vermont myth argue to this day that the common soldier of nazi germany was an honorable chivalrous man fighting for home and hearth untainted by the atrocities of his peers and the hateful rhetoric of his leaders 84 of the 105 cases heard by the advisory board were dramatically lessened or outright commuted and the fairy tale myth of the claim vermont spread through the german populace generations of germans believed in a sharp divide between their ancestors who fought for hitler and his crimes eager to compartmentalize the shame of their nation's atrocities and their own family histories war like history is never simple nor clean the soldiers of germany captured on the battlefield rightfully expected to be treated in accordance with the geneva convention and in many cases they were until the war's end the pragmatic and vindictive moves by the allies to force german pows into rebuilding europe do not excuse the crimes of nazi germany just as nazi atrocities do not excuse allied violations of the geneva convention it is imperative that we remember history is not entirely black and white but rather painted shades of grey with definite areas of clear morality and humanity to simplify history into west versus east good versus evil or any dichotomy is to ignore the true lessons our history has to teach us and the most profound lessons are often to be learned in its darkest chapters [Music] you\",\n",

world war american reliance on french and british tanks throughout the closing days of the war came as a blessing in disguise in 1917 general john j pershing set up a board to study the requirements needed for a new american tank but a series of production complications and the armistice of 1918 left the u.s stuck with manufacturing a french design these licensed built renault ft-17s became the optimal basis for the american six-ton m1917 french steel-rimmed wooden idler wheels were changed to all metal parts the original engine was replaced with a four-cylinder water cooled design by budo engine company and it was armed with the marlin rockwell m1917 machine gun then later browning m1919 this design became an active part of us military experiments over the interwar period these tests involved exercises in weapons deployment terrain maneuvering and modern communication trials m1917s continued to be used in training exercises up to the late 1930s before being sold off to neighboring allies in canada by 1940. it was during this interwar period that military review bureaus began collaborating with companies such as ford motor company and chrysler corporation to help fast-track development of new light and heavy tanks it was only in 1935 that the fruit of their labor came to light with the introduction of the finalized light tank m2a1 neatly addressing all requirements for speed and mobility the m2a1 was fitted with a continental radial aircraft engine which provided enough power for the tank to sustain on-road speed of over 72 kilometers or 44 miles per hour the m2a1's operational range could reach up to 190 kilometers or 118 miles with road access available by the late 1930s the m2a3 and a4 variants were in production and continued to be used sparingly in the pacific theater while the remaining vehicles did their duty as training tanks the early period of the second world war saw a growing priority for a medium tank something that would need to counter axis armor designs active in europe this resulted in the medium tank m2 standardized in 1939 the m2 featured the much requested 37 millimeter m5 gun along with eight multi-turreted 30 cal browning machine guns the m2's armor was a substantial increase from the light tanks currently being fielded ranging from 9.5 to 25 millimeters to transport the added weight a right air-cooled radial engine was fitted allowing for the m2 to reach on-road speeds of 42 kilometers or 26 miles per hour initially there was a major push to include these tanks in the newly formed armored force under major general adna chaffee in 1940 but the facilities at rock island arsenal were unable to meet the demand by august 1940 even the m2a1 contract with chrysler corporation was cancelled due to the new demand for a tank with a larger armament ultimately the m2 would be used for training purposes only while the american medium tank program floundered improvements continued to be made in the light class category of tanks with the arrival of the light tank m3 known as the stuart while retaining the 37 millimeter gun from the m2a4 the stewart featured improved armor with around 4526 accounted for in total many of these early production stewards would see themselves shipped off through lent lease programs throughout the war and even as surplus postwar u.s tank development progressed with a renewed sense of urgency after the fall of france in 1940. the success of the german blitzkrieg proved that a new era of armored warfare had arrived and the u.s needed to adapt or die with virtually no time for testing the m3 lee was quickly pushed into full-scale production the m3's most important feature was the 75 millimeter m2 and later m3 gun capable of easily penetrating contemporary german tanks at almost any range however the rushed production meant that the gun had to be awkwardly mounted in the hole while the cramped turret was fitted with a 37-millimeter gun instead while a true frankenstein of design the early production model still managed to produce over 6 200 units with some serving until the very end of the war in the pacific theater building on lessons learned from the m3 the ordnance department quickly moved to create a new tank that could feasibly mount the large 75 millimeter gun in the turret this was the medium tank m4a1 best known as the sherman set in an m34 mount the same m3 gun used on the lee could now traverse a full 360 degrees letting the sherman engage targets in any direction by this point the us had finally abandoned the cult of the machine gun leaving the m4a1 with just two lights and one heavy mg the maximum armor thickness was increased to 63 millimeters with a top speed of 35 kilometers or 21 miles per hour thanks to the wright r 975 radial engine with over 6281 models of the m4a1 alone produced the sherman remained an active part of all allied armies throughout the second world war with some even being used in the korean war with the success of the newly formed m4 shermans and ongoing m3a4 stewards the demand for air-cooled radial engines forced the army ordnance to explore alternatives prototype designs began in november of 1941 using the standard m3 stuart housing over a newer twin cadillac v8 engine configuration after successful trials the new light tank m5 began production in april 1942. the new engine required the interior space to be increased and many components altered but the m5 retained speeds of 38 kilometers or 23 miles per hour on road with an operational range of 160 kilometers or 100 miles other additions like the high dramatic automatic transitions simplified crew training in the field the m5 and later m5a1 variant would replace the earlier m3 light tank across the us army continuing to be used as the first line of equipment over the course of the second world war while the sherman and stuart proved successful the same could not be said of the american heavy tank project born out of initial requirements set by the chief of infantry courtney hodges in 1940 initial prototyping ran into a series of difficulties which required project oversight from the society of automotive engineers finally after a period of tests and trials with the t1 model the ordnance department contracted baldwin locomotive works to begin production of the standardized heavy tank m6 in december 1942. the vehicle was armed with a 3 inch or 76 millimeter m7 gun alongside a coaxial 37 millimeter gun in the turret with two 50 cal and two 30 cal browning machine guns despite weighing nearly 60 tons and featuring up to 101 millimeters of armor the 960 horsepower right g200 radial gasoline engine allowed the m6 an on road speed of 35 kilometers or 21 miles per hour unfortunately the m6 was let down by several complications and its armament was considered underpowered by its introduction in 1942. due to these problems the m6 was deemed unfit for active service and never left the working prototype stage by 1944 american forces were involved in numerous theaters of war having fought in north africa the mediterranean western europe and the pacific as these theaters progressed so did technology with the united states primarily focusing on improving their tried and tested designs rather than shipping whole new ones across the globe with d-day drawing near there was a clear need for a heavily armored assault vehicle army ground forces in particular were keen to get the ball rolling and suggested the modification of existing designs to better fit the desired role by march of 1944 the procurement of such a vehicle resulted in the newly designed m4 a3 e2 sherman or jumbo as they were unofficially referred to in the field based on the m4a3 sherman the jumbo featured new armored plates welded to the front hole and side sponsons the final drive house was also given a new casting made thicker by a maximum of roughly 140 millimeters on top of this the turret's gun shield also had its armor extended to a maximum of 178 millimeters after production with fisher tank arsenal ended in july 1944 the tanks proved successful in tests at fort knox and the aberdeen proving grounds and were shipped off to the european front by fall their effectiveness on the front lines would go on to expand military interest in applying heavier assault tank models for the remainder of the war alongside armor and firepower improvements from designs like the jumbo the us military were also pursuing changes to performance and reliability of existing models one of the more successful variants to come out of these trials was the m4a3 76 millimeter wet hvss sherman as this was quite the mouthful the tank was given a less formal nickname the ez8 besides the armor improvements a more powerful ford g double-a engine and a new 76 millimeter gun the ez8 introduced a wet ammunition stowage to reduce fires the horizontal veloute spring suspension system also provided a much smoother all-terrain performance thanks to all of these modifications the ez-8 was quickly recognized as an excellent tank even after the second world war finding common use in the korean war against the t-3485 as the ordnance department built and tested the t20 series of medium tanks the addition of heavier armor and a larger turret to hold the 90 millimeter gun carried it over into the heavy class by 1945 after years of difficulties these efforts culminated in the m26 heavy tank or pershing although retaining the sherman's general layout many radical changes were introduced resulting in a very different vehicle the hole was simplified which allowed for an armor thickness up to 100 to 110 millimeters around the front and gun shields and a new ford gaf v8 engine and torsion bar suspension were used to compensate for the new turret rolling out in 1945 the pershing saw little action in the final months of the second world war though a notable engagement occurred during the offensive at ramagan despite its proven capabilities the m26 still had many deficiencies so it was developed further leading to the patent line of tanks the end of the second world war did not mean the end of american tank research and development with new threats came a new desire for new armor and continuous improvement of the tank platforms became a high priority throughout the cold war with the m26 pershing's reclassification as a heavy tank in 1946 the desires to improve on its design led to the creation of the m46 patent the m46 was based on the standard m26 design retaining the turret and forward hole structure as well as the machine gun improvements were also made to the tank's reliability a stronger v12 engine cross-drive transmission a better power pack and restructured exhaust system gave the m46 much better performance in the field along with the 800 initial models an extra 360 variations were manufactured based off of the dozer m46a1 and m46e1 variants all of these saw action primarily during the korean war before their eventual replacement in december 1960 a combined production effort between detroit tank arsenal and chrysler corporation led to the m60 fitted with a 105 millimeter m68 gun the long length of the barrel provided opportunities for engagement over longer distances and the addition of more modern targeting instruments increased accuracy the combination of smart design and lighter materials such as the interchangeable aluminum wheels and the supercharged diesel engine gave the m60 both impressive speed and a larger operational range despite the early model m60 carrying their own problems relating to armor and shock absorption they were still in active service throughout the 1960s and 1970s serving alongside the m48 and later variant m-60s in vietnam and even the gulf war the limitations of the m41 walker bulldog left the ordnance corps ready to update their light tank capabilities in 1966 the allison division of general motors began building the 152 millimeter gun launcher armored reconnaissance or airborne assault vehicle designated as the m551 or sheridan its main gun the 152 millimeter m81 was very technologically advanced but required modifications like a bore evacuator to deal with leftover fumes not only were regular munitions available but mgm-51 chilela missiles could also be fired from the sheridan's main cannon as long-range guided anti-tank weapons but early production sheridans with the m81 e1 gun also had trouble with barrel wear as the extreme stress from the ammunition caused cracks at the muzzle end of the missile keyway leaving the maximum rounds available under 200 this was fixed in later modifications of the gun allowing for a safe tube life of 600 rounds the sheridan saw combat in vietnam and the invasion of panama but only used its chilela missiles in combat during desert storm six years before they were withdrawn from service with no replacement the late cold war saw the u.s military collaborating with western germany on a joint research project known as the mbt-70 program which sought to provide nato with a main battle tank capable of countering the new warsaw pact designs although the mbt-70 project would be dissolved in early 1971. the united states would use it as a springboard to develop the 105 millimeter gun tank m1 designated abrams the m1 featured a new type of composite armor built in a specific profile designed to maximize crew survivability as well as the namesake m68a1 105 millimeter gun which gave it considerable firepower normally such a tank would be weighed down by this combination of armor and gunnery but the abrams extremely powerful honeywell gas turbine engine could put out 1500 horsepower giving the abrams a maximum cruising speed of 68 kilometers or 42 miles per hour on road the m1 abrams rolled out in service in 1980 joining the new era of modern battle tanks emerging throughout the world similar to the german leopot and soviet t-80 as the cold war reached its final stages the united states focused its energies on improving and developing the m1 platform the fall of the soviet union in 1991 did little to lessen american interest in tank development and the m1 remains central to the us military's arsenal by 1992 a series of existing variants of the original m1 led to the introduction of a heavier variant known as the 120 millimeter gun tank m1a2 improving over the m1 abrams gun the m1a2 saw the replacement of an m256 120 millimeter gun which increased overall weight improved internal components armor and other combat systems were also included to ensure the tank was kept up to scratch outside of general upgrades the m1a2 also had specific improvements added based on its service with a major example being the addition of the tank urban survival kit which was included for use in the urban conditions of the middle east a series of advanced weapon systems were also added over time like the crew remote operated weapon system or continuous electronic enhancement program all necessary to ensure the effectiveness and crew survivability it was intended for while initially introduced in 1992 the m1a2 has seen various improvements leading up to its current m1a2 sep v3 model while there have been proposals for an m1a3 variant a number of delays has led to the m1a2 sep v4 being the only developmental model ready for

fallujah in november 2004 is one of the most notorious of the war in iraq it was a bloody slog of urban warfare during which u.s british and iraqi forces attempted to drive out islamist insurgents under the leadership of abu musab al-zarqawi a jordanian jihadist known for masterminding a series of terrorist attacks fallujah marked a turning point in the war it was the first major battle to be fought entirely against insurgents rather than loyalists of saddam hussein's bath party although ultimately a victory for the u.s and its allies this phyric triumph came at the cost of many civilian lives and failed to break the back of the insurgency which would continue to thrive in the region in today's episode we'll examine how this brutal house by house battle unfolded and how it set the

contractors that operation known as vigilant resolve ended with a u.s withdrawal and an agreement that the local population would keep the insurgency out of the city but instead fallujah would become a significant stronghold for insurgents such as al qaeda and the islamic army in iraq among others as the number of insurgents swelled american concern grew to match and by september u.s commanders were planning a military operation to seize control of the city operation phantom fury the primary motivation was to provide security for iraq's first elections of the post-saddam era but another important strategic objective was the capture of zarqawi who was believed by the u.s to be holed up in fallujah u.s forces had kept a tight hold on fallujah's surroundings they maintained checkpoints on all roads leading out of the city and seized any iraqi police and national guard vehicles attempting to leave during the night ac-130 gunships destroyed every vehicle spotted with a weapon and conducted frequent bombardments of any house suspected to be harboring insurgents the civilian population recognizing the costly signs of an imminent american assault fled the city in droves many neighborhoods were totally abandoned including fallujah's southern district dubbed queens by u.s soldiers by october reconnaissance flights showed empty clothes lines and abandoned streets indeed the civilian population was estimated to have fallen from around 280 000 to as little as 30 000 these empty neighborhoods were swiftly filled by more than 3 000 insurgents who took to operating in small groups of between 4 and 20 fighters amid the abandoned homes these dispersed groups were able to weather the american bombardment in fallujah's resilient cement houses unable to blast them from their shelters the americans would have to clear them out room by room it would be a hard fight to even get to that point since april the insurgents numbers had doubled as they drew in combatants from virtually every armed group in iraq trenches were dug roads blocked with concrete barriers or collections of cars and trucks jury-rigged emplacements of earthworks and sandbags prepared the insurgents had even managed to capture some weaponry from coalition forces among the most effective defenses however were the improvised explosive devices or ieds with which the insurgents riddled the city fallujah was covered in booby traps buried under the streets taped to the side of telephone poles and hidden in rubble abandoned vehicles or empty houses ready to explode the moment a marine passed by marine expeditionary force planners knew they would be walking into an enormous urban death trap but the americans had their own advantages most notably their large force of professional and experienced soldiers for operation phantom fury commanding officer major general richard natanski believed it important to attack fallujah with as much strength as possible his forces reinforced by two u.s armored battalions and a u.s army armored brigade consisted of 10 500 marines who would be fighting alongside 2 000 troops from the recently established iraqi security forces and 850 soldiers from the famous scottish blackwatch battalion from the british armed forces this coalition vastly outnumbered the insurgents the americans also had the advantage of formidable air power with ac-130 gunships on hand to provide close air support during the fighting however these aircraft would only operate at night for fear of being targeted by surface-to-air missiles this caused serious consternation among commanders on the ground with one officer remarking they would be fighting with one hand tied behind our backs nevertheless their presence was a major boon to the us during the brutal urban warfare that was to come understanding the scale of the challenge ahead of them american planners worked to ensure there would be no logistical disruptions during the battle fearing possible attacks on convoys along the highway that could delay shipments and cause shortages a vast excess of fuel ammunition and supplies would be sent to the forces around fallujah to prevent any need for risky resupply major general natanski divided the city into two halves and assigned to each a regimental combat team made up of mostly u.s marines and reinforced by an army armored battalion these were rct1 and rct7 built around the 1st and 7th marine regiments respectively each was hidden behind a large railway berm to the north of the city which they would have to break through to begin the assault rct-1 would provide the main thrust of the attack entering the city from the north which was less heavily defended than the city's southern and eastern entrances in order to lend an element of surprise to the attack some elements of rct-1 would launch diversionary attacks in the south meanwhile rct-7 would advance from the northeast to support the main assault its primary objectives were to ensure the jolan district where the insurgent forces were thought to be the most concentrated and seized control of the makadi mosque which housed the enemy headquarters heavy army task forces would lead the way on both thrusts driving as rapidly as possible toward the city center while the marines took on the difficult task of house to house clearing in their wake meanwhile the black watch would maintain the perimeter around fallujah and prevent other insurgent forces from cutting the city off finally three battalions of relatively well-trained but poorly equipped iraqi security forces were brought in to support the americans and provide peacekeeping after the battle the battle began in the er on the night of november 7th the iraqi 36th commando battalion and their u.s army special forces advisers captured fallujah general hospital and several minor targets in the west and the south seeking to distract and confuse enemy combatants they were watched closely by marines 10 miles away through the infrared camera of a pioneer unmanned aerial vehicle who relayed their observations to the forces on the ground via radio two other uavs were surveying the city that night seeking out the dark outlines of insurgents clustering in place or manning a heavy weapon these positions would be relayed to basher the code name given to the ac-130 gunships waiting to unleash their deadly payload of 105 millimeter artillery shells these attacks meant certain doom for their targets the only escape was to take shelter in a mosque targeting a religious building is a war crime making mosques guaranteed protection from aerial bombardment fallujah known as the city of mosques had 200 of these to choose from mosques were also reported to house significant amounts of armaments making them extremely useful locations for insurgent forces the diversion was successful securing the peninsula west of the city and the two bridges across the euphrates river allowing the regimental combat teams to prepare for the main assault to begin the following day the daylight hours were spent striking key targets with artillery unmanned predator drones and guided bomb units to soften up the city's defenses after dark the marines began their attack along the northern edge of the city with support from tanks and artillery they first captured the railway station before advancing into the city proper entering the heinem al-dibat and al-naziza districts by the afternoon of the 8th the night was cold with intermittent rain showers but the marine's path was regularly lit by the detonation of dozens of rockets and mortars from the insurgents as well as tank artillery mortar and aircraft fire from the americans themselves however some units struggled to break through the railway berm and were stuck for hours as engineers attempted to blast through amid withering fire and rain the coalition forces made significant progress during the night but when sun rose on november 9th the momentum of the battle shifted the insurgents began to aim their mortars more precisely and effectively and their fighters took full advantage of the dense urban landscape to whittle down their foes small groups of insurgents would dash through the narrow alleys emerging briefly to fire rpg rounds at their enemies before darting away out of sight while others used these sturdy cement buildings as pill boxes from which to fire upon the approaching marines the fighting was at its most brutal inside the houses as they advanced squads of marines would search each home one by one clearing them of enemy fighters in slow exhausting urban fighting they found no combatants in most but sometimes without warning they would enter a house to see grenades rolling across the floor toward them and a hail of gunfire bursting out of the shadows clearing a house required incredible persistence and overwhelming firepower including the use of mk-153 rocket launchers if even these big guns failed the marines would resort to smashing the windows tossing in grenades and sending hundreds of rifle rounds into the house before bursting in to mop up any remaining foes but this would be easier said than done with insurgents lurking in every shadow and booby traps exploding around them the marines advanced through the streets of fallujah at a snail's pace both sides would receive scant rest each night with mortar fire continuing to rain down around them americans did their best to hunker down inside houses and sleep in a bid to unsettle them the insurgents adopted unique psychological warfare tactics blasting incessant chants from loudspeakers in the city's mosques in return us army humvees roamed the streets playing everything from guns and roses songs to the predator sound effect in deafening volumes the next morning the urban warfare resumed in much the same way with brutal fighting for each and every city block the insurgents were relentless but by november 11th the northern half of fallujah had fallen to the americans a day later as u.s forces closed in on the insurgent headquarters american aggression increased it was estimated one in every 20 houses contained hostile troops compared to one in every 50 houses previously thought now anticipating enemy fire from every building the marine standing orders became enter every room with a boom as the units advanced insurgents who had slipped back behind the front line or had remained hidden emerged to trouble the rear of the advancing line marines had to remain behind to continually clear and re-clear houses we spoke to a veteran of the battle who recalls we were afraid of doors rigged to explode since we had to go door to door and clear the buildings and they didn't care whose house they rigged we had guys attempt to breach doors of regular civilian homes and as a result of the door being rigged it would send shrapnel and debris everywhere nevertheless at the end of the 12th rcts 1 and 7 had reached all of their major objectives but it would take more time for the marines to fully secure them often the americans would encounter not enemy fighters but civilians who had failed to escape ahead of the battle although they would typically wave white flags in warning as soon as they heard the marines approach sometimes things did not go smoothly hundreds of civilians were killed over the course of this bloody house by house warfare at some stage of the fighting american artillery units began to employ white phosphorus an extremely deadly incendiary agent to root out dug-in insurgent forces the use of this toxic caustic chemical weapon is considered legitimate if used to illuminate a battlefield or to produce smoke but its use against enemy personnel is a violation of international law and is a war crime some journalists accused the americans of deploying white phosphorus against civilian targets an accusation vigorously denied by the us military it has however been admitted to using the weapon against enemy combatants when conventional weapons became ineffective claiming to have ensured no civilians were present before using it by december 13th the fighting had begun to slow fallujah was under almost total coalition control although the occupying forces still faced stiff resistance from isolated pockets of insurgents some of the fiercest individual fights came in the battle's closing stages such as the so-called house of hell in which a marine battalion faced down a group of well-trained fanatical chechen fighters in a well-defended home around this time humanitarian operations were allowed to begin despite continued bouts of air strikes and small arms fire rct 7 set up a humanitarian center at the alhadra mosque and marines in the jolan district arranged for local iraqis to enter the city to recover the bodies of dead insurgents for the following two weeks mef command described the ongoing operations as simply mopping up the final pockets of militants sporadic combat would continue until the 23rd after nearly a month and a half of fighting since the battle allegations of war crimes massacres and human rights abuses have emerged this has made fallujah a focal point for opposition to the war in iraq and across the west the battle was brutal ultimately proving to be one of the bloodiest in the entire conflict coalition forces suffered 720 casualties with 107 killed and 613 wounded of these 95 of those killed and 500 of those wounded were american while four british soldiers were killed guarding the highway deaths among the insurgents are estimated as ranging from fifteen hundred to two thousand killed and another fifteen hundred captured fallujah's civilians suffered eight hundred lives lost over the course of the battle and in the years since there's been a marked rise in infant mortality cancer and congenital anomalies or birth defects a consequence of depleted uranium exposure from munitions the city too witnessed catastrophic destruction with nearly one-fifth of its buildings destroyed and over half of those remaining experiencing heavy damage fallujah once the city of mosques had seen 60 of its 200 places of worship destroyed during the battle although the city was captured the coalition had failed to land a decisive blow against the insurgents many of them simply slipped away into the surrounding al-anbar province including abu musab al-zarqawi by 2006 the province with the exception of the city of fallujah was reported to be in total insurgent control leaving the united states with the hard task of battling them for many years to come you\",\n",

take place at a different stage of the war starting with operation barbarossa and ending with the soviet invasion of germany although we've done our best to depict each vehicle accurately it is an undeniable truth that such match-ups were unlikely to occur in reality both sides practiced combined arms warfare and even isolated tank platoons would almost certainly be accompanied by infantry or other support while we've tried to create reasonable scenarios for each of our battles please remember that our primary purpose is to match up tanks and see how they perform against each other not

shakes his head reaching for a shell as he inches back to consciousness next to him the driver strains against the control levers poorly oiled hinges screeching their defiance the valine obelisk is poor tank country and the ukrainian summer turns this t26 into an oven with a gun the gunner slams his shell home limp arms pulling him to his sight the turret traverses at a glacial pace finally target acquired the gunner wipes another bloody trickle away as his concussed eye focuses in on a panzer iii the commander barks the order the panzer crew braces as the russian shell whistles toward them slamming into the ukrainian loam the panzer commander can't help but chuckle soviet gunnery at its finest the german gunner rams another shell home focusing in on the stricken t26 the young tanker gives his weapon an affectionate path the russians are protected by just 15 millimeters of armor far less than what their 50 millimeter shell can easily penetrate the driver scoffs as the gunner squares his shot this isn't war this is sport the gunner signals the commander pauses for effect then orders the shot another soviet tank falls before the mighty panzer battalions his reverie is interrupted by an urgent radio call it is critical they surround and destroy the blind behemoth lest it find a way out and cost more german lives the gunner looks at the redirac their panzer granata 40 rounds could penetrate the kv-1's turret but only at point-blank range the commander acknowledges the radio call and after a moment's reflection switches to the intercom band looks like they're going for a drive the gunner of the kv-1 drums on the receiver of his l-11 cannon the metal is warm to the touch like everything else in the cramped turret clanging on the hole the driver clambers back into the turret wiping grease and sweat from his face the track has finally been repaired and they can try to free themselves from the ruined building now the commander rolls his shoulders and peeks into his optics suddenly the gunner hears a shocked cry from the commander bringing his own periscope round the gunner sees nothing but a cloud of dense white smoke he curses feeling the hole vibrate as the driver starts easing them out of the wreckage heart pounding he hears the clunk of the gun breach as the loader shoves a shell into place somehow he knows it will likely be the last round his gun will ever fire and he intends to make it count the torsion bar suspension provides a remarkably smooth ride over the roughly paved road surface riding head out the german officer talks to his driver via throat mic warning him to avoid potholes and piles of debris smoke rounds from the lone panzer iv stationed on a nearby hill mark the enemy while the panzer 3 and 38ts keep their attention there are twin t34s in the village but they are caught reloading with one tungsten cord 50 millimeter projectile punching straight through an unlucky tank's turret ring the other tank attempts a repost and the hurried shot manages to hit home striking the ammo rack on a panzer 38t in a surprisingly tame explosion soviet fireworks the russians can't help but cheer in their turret until a panzer granata 40 decides to invite itself to the celebration the shell slams headlong into the t-34's armor failing to penetrate but causing a cloud of shrapnel to burst from the back of the impacted plate the soviet crew are shredded by this erzatz buckshot killed by the very armor that should have protected them with no unit cohesion the remaining soviet tanks are little more than armored coffins and the survivors of the german ambush surrender the moment they realize their foes are inside the village the greatest threat remains however as the kv-1 retreats to a more favorable position the panzer 3s boldly give chase one breaks through a gap between two t-34 carcasses as the other pushes down the street to flank the panzer closest engages head-on a critical mistake the panzer iv atop the hill is unable to support as its vision is obscured by foliage and smoke by the burning t-34s the upstart tank is left scrambling to load a new round as the enemy turret slews toward it it's not enough the german commander ducks down into his turret as debris thunks against his tank he scrambles into the main compartment to scream at the gun the barrel of the 50 millimeter gun depresses sharply before firing armor piercing round slicing through the exposed right track of the kv-1 and mangling the leading road wheel now immobilized the heavy tank is helpless to pursue the two remaining panzers rather than try to engage it again the officer radios the panzer iv to load high explosive and bring the buildings around the metal menace down in an instant it's trapped again and unable to shoot at anything beyond point-blank range although still dangerous the tank is no longer an active threat and can be safely ignored until sappers or artillery are available to destroy it with clear advantages in communication and leadership the germans almost took the field in our first engagement only the superior durability of the kv-1 prevents us from declaring this a true german victory during the initial stage of operation barbarossa soviet tanks were numerically superior and some were better armed and armored than their german counterparts but their advantages in firepower were often undermined by a crippling lack of unit cohesion the early t34 models also featured such bad optics that some took dozens of hits from german 37 millimeter guns before even realizing that they were under attack the few kv tanks that were made also suffered from similar issues while the bt-7 and t26 models were too lightly armored to be used in the anti-tank role german tanks were also lightly armored but featured superb ergonomics and intercom systems that let their crews perform far better than their soviet adversaries but it was not all to be sunshine and sauerkraut as the germans soon discovered a chilling fact even as the russians suffered loss after loss they were learning it's a fine summer day in the fields of prakarovka the sun is shining a gentle breeze shakes the barley t-34s are coming over the hills t-34s are coming over the hills a german gunner sends a round flying from the barrel of his panzer iv lighting up a soviet tank in a spectacular explosion as the loader racks the breach and scrambles to bring a new round up from the ready rack the gunner scans the horizon through his optics a seemingly endless wave of red tanks have come to reclaim this territory for the communists the loader gives the gunner a tap and he lines up a shot on yet another t-34 a radio call echoes through the cupola between their panzers and incoming tigers the germans might just repel this mad soviet charge as he sends his shell flying the gunner can't help but wonder why the hell are the soviets just driving straight at them the soviet driver jams his throttle as wide as it will go the commander anxiously grips his handrails looking through his optics as the german tanks grow closer and closer another shot from that tiger another one of his comrades literally blown away it seems like madness but this reckless charge has a grim purpose even with their improved 76 millimeter guns the t-34s have no hope of penetrating the heavy german tiger tanks at long range so their orders are to close the distance as fast as possible but as he peers through his periscope the commander spots something odd the muzzle flashes are far too dim he focuses in on one he's realized a mistake the commander pulls his radio barking in order to the mass of t-34s around him those are not tiger tanks disperse and prepare to fire these soviet tanks peel off breaking formation and pulling up at various ranges along the front so scattered the commanders hope to buy enough time to pick off the german tanks at medium range it's about time the russians pulled their heads out of their borscht the german commander gives his driver a chuck on the shoulder now this should be a fight these soviets begin shooting back for the first time all day a ragged volley shredding some unlucky trees and carving deep holes into the ukrainian soil the germans traversed their turrets in all directions lining up shots and picking off the now isolated t-34s but the russian numbers begin to assert themselves as the german's fire is answered with a near-constant though inaccurate barrage from the t-34s soon each tank is bracketed like a battleship every german tanker knows that's the last shot fired before the end the soviet shells begin hitting home and the germans suffer their first losses of the day then something comes over the radio a tiger tank crests the hill behind the panzers as the sole member of its group that didn't break down on the way this tiger will turn the tide the russian commander gazes in shock at the road junction that's the tiger it cannot end like this as his sub commanders begin filling the airwaves with panicked requests for orders our commander shouts to his driver the t-34 takes off like an armored bat out of soviet hell tearing across the remaining distance and avoiding german fire through sheer luck a handful of tanks follow suit and as the t-34s close to near point-blank range the commander orders his driver to floor it they'll dash through the remaining panzers and engage the tiger in a desperate tank melee victory will be theirs and this field will be retaken for the glory of the soviet the commander is suddenly thrown forward into his optics the brass mounting knocking him out cold in one strike the t-34s crashed spectacularly into an old anti-tank ditch hidden in the scrub just before the german position a ditch that retreating soviet infantry had dug just the day before the tiger slowly descends the hill scattering what t-34s were not foolhardy enough to follow their commander into the hole but a couple soviet shells slam into the thick cat's armor and some spawn goes into the assistant gunner's eyes looks like someone just earned a wound badge this field belongs to germany [Music] by mid-1943 the red army was almost exclusively focused on the production of new t-34s the need to shift soviet industry across the urals had consumed a vast amount of time and resources leaving few opportunities to experiment with new designs or update existing ones as a result the t-34 was completely outmatched by newer german designs like the tiger or panther but maintained superiority in numbers furthermore as the tides turned against the axis many german tank designs fell into enemy hands where they were analyzed for strengths and weaknesses with room to breathe these soviets could finally come up with designs able to go toe-to-toe with the finest of german armor our final battle will pit the results of these programs against germany's own last-ditch efforts to secure dominance in the field of armored warfare the loud war of engines fill the air around the soviet-held town of sandomirsch as a column of eight heavy tanks bulldoze their way out of the rubble-strewn streets and into the fields beyond sitting inside the turret of his is-2 with the radio station mere inches away the commander listens carefully to the reports being fed to him by reconnaissance elements in the area the atmosphere inside the vehicle is tense but controlled the four crew members all sharing a long history in the red army a transmission on the radio informs the men that the german counter-attack is imminent t3485s have already engaged a column of panthers a few miles away but the commander is certain that it's just a distraction so he's kept his heavy tanks back near the bridgehead his suspicions are confirmed when he peers out of his cupola and spots something moving in the trees a few hundred meters away the king tiger's transmission audibly grinds with the effort of pushing the gigantic vehicle through the thick undergrowth the german officer can't help but wince at every tortured sound the engine makes as his inexperienced driver fumbles with these stiff controls taking his platoon through the woodland was an enormous gamble but it appears to have paid off so far now with the engine struggling to push them to their top speed of about 10 miles an hour the king tigers finally rumble into the open ready to bombard sandomirsch until reinforcements can arrive but luck like so many other things is not on his side as soon as the tigers emerge from the forest the officer sees a formation of soviet tanks already rolling out to meet him seeing he is faced with is-2s the officer makes a snap decision charge he doesn't trust his rookie crews to win a long-range duel and the huge 122 millimeter soviet guns require special two-piece ammunition that makes them much slower to reload than the german 88 millimeter counterparts the two vehicles on the flanks launch smoke grenades for cover while the others make ranging shots with high explosive rounds the accuracy of his inexperienced gunners leaves more to be desired at the best of times much less on the move and these soviet tanks react remarkably fast none hit but these shock waves are felt through the holes of every vehicle the site of five tiger twos emerging from the tree line briefly shocks the soviet platoon commander it's an unexpected play but years of fighting the cunning germans has made him quick to adapt fully expecting his first salvo to miss he takes precautions by ordering his gunner to wait for the smoke of the volley to clear then adjust his aim accordingly now the enormous gun breach violently flings itself back towards emily the 122 millimeter shell landing just two feet from its intended target luckily it was a high explosive round and the 3.6 kilogram warhead turns the left track of a king tiger into metal confetti the enemy formation collapses the other tanks either grinding to a halt or swerving to avoid further aimed fire only the two leading vehicles stay together presenting their sloped millimeter thick frontal plates toward the enemy now the soviets must endure the fury of the german kwk-43s while their crews scramble to reload the near instant immobilization of one of his tanks only serves to further dishearten our german officer but the zoldat draws upon his last reserves of resolve and begins shouting his formation back into order his gunners hands shake as they align the sights on target and the first armor-piercing round falls hopelessly short as a result as the loader slams the next round into the breach the gunner takes a deep breath and aims more carefully this time the projectile strikes true striking an is-2 in the turret facing and cleaving straight into the armor the sight seems to inspire the other crews and soon the tigers are firing in a steady rhythm easily managing three or four shots every one sent in return in moments another is-2 is destroyed then another and for a few minutes it seems as if the tide has turned but then two 122 millimeter shells strike a tiger ii in its upper glossy plate the armor holds but the welding points don't and the entire plate slumps downward almost six inches leaving a giant gap it's the last straw for the rookies and the two undamaged tigers both start to reverse back toward the tree line but one unlucky tiger begins to shake violently belching acrid smoke as its engine gives its last metallic whale cursing his terrible luck the german officer tries to rally his men but is interrupted by a new message the panthers acting as a distraction a few miles away have been overwhelmed and forced to withdraw reinforcements have not arrived and now several dozen t-34 t-3485s are racing toward his position isolated and outnumbered at least five to one his gambit has clearly failed all that's left is to go down fighting [Music] towards the end of the war german forces were constantly on the defensive however their tanks were ill-suited to such operations and heavy crew losses meant that many of germany's most advanced war machines were being operated by raw recruits meanwhile the red army had developed its own core of battle-hardened veterans who had learned from their mistakes and knew how to fight back even when faced with superior opposition the adoption of new guns such as the 122 millimeter for the is-2 and the 85-millimeter for the t-34 also gave soviet crews a fighting chance against even the heaviest german armor german tankers were constantly tasked with near-suicidal missions while shortages of critical alloys meant that inferior substitutes were often used in the construction of their heaviest vehicles huge lumbering tanks like the king tiger also lacked mobility preventing their commanders from engaging in the fast adaptive tactical maneuvers that had defined their successes during the earlier phases of the war in the end germany was simply outnumbered outgunned and out thought on every level so [Music] you\",\n",

government or raj was a racially segregated and socially stratified body with a white ruling class held above the native indians the caste system assisted in maintaining social control white's only businesses were common and indian people were even prohibited from entering certain districts of cities in their own country despite these prohibitions a kind of indian middle class developed professionals who managed to work within the system to find some measure of security and prosperity a young gandhi belonged to this class as an up-and-coming lawyer however the vast majority of indians were to put it mildly dissatisfied with the system perhaps sensing the rising tide of anti-colonial sentiment the raj began a policy of indianization in the 1920s and 30s which saw more and more native indians placed in government and military positions a particular note was the introduction of indian officers to the local military forces which until this point had been under exclusively white command these native officers were often placed in charge of all indian units while on their face these reforms were billed as steps towards self-rule and indian success the reality was that they were token concessions to silence nationalist rumblings a way for the british to simultaneously mollify their critics and maintain control britannia rules the indians as they rule the waves this was to the raja's mind a fact the second world war would put this fact to the test the fall of poland in 1939 brought the infamous sits krieg and eight months of little change to the sub-continent this gave the people of india time to reflect time to begin seeing the war in europe as a far-off matter a news item that wouldn't touch their homeland like the united states india was thousands of miles from europe protected by sea and desert mountain and plain being in india was like being in a grandstand watching some game or other according to british civil service officer hey mcdonald mcdonald's attitude was not a popular one however many of his compatriots were firmly fixed on joining the coming fight thus the british ordered the indian army mobilized at the start of the war in 1939 with viceroy of india lord lindleth linlethgo believing wholeheartedly that the indian people would sign on in droves to fight for democracy and freedom king and country indeed one group of native indians came flocking to the union jack the wealthy maharajas of the princely states within the structure of the raj roughly one-third of the native population was ruled over by indian princes who administered fiefdoms in the empire's name when linleth go called the maharajahs saw an opportunity to shore up their power in the face of the rising indian independence movement the princes viewed indian nationalism as an existential threat and hoped that by eagerly and vigorously supporting the british crown their survival would be guaranteed in an independent india revolutions even peaceful ones are often unkind to the crowned heads the princes raised battalions of infantry and artillery or funneled their wealth into the british war chest scores of princes writing six figure checks to the british air ministry and other departments with their men and their money these old royals hoped to preserve their preeminence in indian society be it under british rule or in a free indian state average indians were equally interested in the conflict and public opinion was surprisingly varied over who was in the right india at this time included a variety of ethnic and religious groups groups that did not always coexist peacefully the cause of indian independence sometimes ran along these religious and ethnic lines and hitler's idea of racial purity found willing adoptees in the militant wings of the indian independence movement such hitlerians included the rashtriya swayam seva sank hindu nationalist group who openly celebrated adolf hitler and his desire for racial purity as well as his methods in obtaining it meanwhile those indians who favored the allies found themselves increasingly frustrated with the british who should have been their compatriots while indian politicians were anxious to defend their homes and promote their people's prosperity the british showed interest in india solely as a well of manpower from which to draw colonial troops hopes of a new cooperation came in 1940 when the british and indian governments reached an astonishing agreement london would pay for the entirety of india's war expenses and flood the colony with investment the british would foot the bill for recruitment and transport of indian soldiers and bankroll sweeping infrastructure improvements but london's generosity proved hollow the british paid their debts with sterling credits essentially government ious that forced india to front the actual money devastating the indian economy when the british government enacted the defense of india act granting government officials unlimited power to crack down on any sentiment speech or action they considered disloyal the imperial government's priorities were spelled out focus on the war and keep india under political and economic control while the british worked to consolidate control on the home front indian soldiers found their life in the field surprisingly varied the social dynamics of some units were perfect mirrors of the raj with white officers enforcing a kind of de facto segregation disputes broke out over pay discrepancies between white and indian officers of equal rank the content of ration tins and even whether radios should be tuned to western or indian musical stations while this form of petty racially driven office politics was the rule in some units others turned out to be surprisingly progressive for the era a common rule for these units was the prohibition of speaking in derogatory terms in the presence of indian officers about their political leaders customs traditions or music while others accepted their indian peers of their own accord once they'd proven their medal and competence in the field this attitude began to work its way up to the lines with the infantry committee penning a report midway through the war identifying segregation within units as a critical issue the most strenuous efforts must be made to ensure that no discrimination of any nature is permitted by the end of the war 2.5 million indians would fight for the british empire providing a critical component of the allied forces that defeated the axis powers powers that succeeded in bringing the war to india's doorstep imperial japan's attack on pearl harbor was like a bucket of icy water dumped onto india's head up till now the people of india thought the second world war would play out much like the first with indian troops sent to far-off lands and the subcontinent spared of actual fighting the japanese were all too happy to disabuse india of this notion and pearl harbor was followed by an east asian blitzkrieg that toppled colonial government after colonial government the japanese carved a beachhead into india's neighbor burma and seized hong kong singapore and british malaya india therefore became a crucial staging ground for the allies in the pacific and refugees fled the japanese advance for the perceived safety of the raj a flow which only intensified after the japanese captured the burmese capital in march by the end of the month the japanese had captured all of burma and cut the critical overland supply route from india to china burma's fall opened india up to a direct japanese invasion with bengal first on the block panic swept through this province in this desperate hour as their imperial subjects were wracked with fear the british raj stepped in to restore calm by enacting a scorched earth policy that devastated the civilian population food stockpiles were seized by government forces bridges were destroyed civilian watercraft confiscated or sunk waterways sabotaged if the japanese invaded bengal they would inherit a ruin however the japanese had reached the end of their supply lines in burma and were unable to advance in india so they bombed it as british soldiers sacked what they should have been defending and japanese ordinance fell from the sky the people of bengal found themselves straddling a tightrope over the bottomless chasm of starvation fishermen had no craft with which to ply their trade farmers had no crops nor way to get them to market if they did in 1942 the ravening clause of hunger would snare india in their clutches the bengal famine had begun the famine was a tragedy within a tragedy an epidemic of hunger and disease that saw between two to three million people die while the dominant narrative for some time has been that extreme weather was a leading cause of the tragedy more modern research seems to indicate british policies in india as the chief cause of the famine indian american scientist and journalist madushri makerji posits that over-exploitation of indian resources by british leadership directly caused the famine with london continuing to pull tons of rice from india even as leaders of the raj begged for emergency food aid [Music] hordes of refugees from burma poured into india increasing demand for what food was available fungus devastated rice crops severely limiting edible produce british industrialists and landowners intervened engaging in profiteering during the crisis freak weather devastated farmland and wiped out villages and lastly though not exhaustively the raj made great efforts to keep the famine out of the press which prevented the possibility of international aid that could have saved lives what is beyond debate is the devastating impact the famine had on the people of bengal the british inquiry into the famine noted a breakdown of family units as husbands deserted wives and wives husbands elderly dependents were left behind in villages babies and young children were sometimes abandoned historian dr janam mukherjee describes the hellscape that bengal became corpses lay scattered over several thousand square miles of devastated land 7 400 villages were partly or wholly destroyed by the storm cholera dysentery and other water-borne diseases flourished as the japanese postured and people starved in the streets social pressures began to mount politics in india did not stop with the declaration of war and indian nationalism only intensified as british administrators fumbled and fumbled again the discussion was dominated by mahatma gandhi's indian national congress drawn from the hindu majority of indians and muhammad ali janaz muslim league who feared becoming second-class citizens in an independent india as time wore on the inc began to emphasize hinduism as a critical component to indian society leading to the muslim league's lahore resolution calling for separate muslim and hindu states this marked the effective end of cooperation between the two and indian nationalists were driven into the arms of militant extremist leaders these included pro-axis forces such as the indian national army led by subhas chandra bose bose grew the ina to 43 000 members at its peak rallying the disaffected indians with his promise give me blood and i will give you freedom the ina would go on to fight in burma against the british collaborating with the japanese until the wars end other indians chose less drastic methods of expressing their displeasure with the british as numbers of british and american troops in india swelled cultural clashes and outright crime ensued american troops began slaughtering cattle held sacred in hinduism while allegations of sexual assault scandalized the indian population gandhi and the inc responded by issuing the quit india resolution in august of 1942 a largely symbolic call for india to cease cooperation with the british until they guaranteed independence the british responded by arresting gandhi and many inc leaders who they would hold for three years gandhi even from prison exhorted his followers to peaceful protest instead the indian independence movement chose violence protests in bombay saw 33 people killed by police in the four days following the inc leadership's arrest and a wave of attacks on government buildings ensued the british cracked down hard and 2500 indians were killed the raj ultimately succeeded in putting down the insurrection and indian independence would have to wait until the war was won while the british fought the indian people the japanese fought the indian army indian troops managed to reclaim some of burma in december of 1942 and the japanese responded by bombing calcutta for several days most of 1943 in india would be dedicated to reorganization and rearming of the indian army as the japanese had taught the raj a bloody lesson they were not ready to face the japanese in open battle while troops in the subcontinent readied to defend their home indians abroad helped liberate north africa before participating in operation husky seeing action throughout sicily as 1943 drew to a close the reinvigorated indian army prepared to march against the japanese the japanese watched the indian revitalization with concern and decided they needed to once again launch a surprise attack to keep the initiative in march of 1944 they enacted their plan dubbed operation hugo which saw intense fighting on the burmese border the indians stood against the japanese at the border towns of imphal and kohima the determined indians stood their ground against the japanese invasion and come july their foe had no choice but to break off the attack the indian national army under bose fought in the japanese attack and along with civilian collaborators rendered aid and comfort to the retreating japanese as the allies gave chase to the japanese and encountered these collaborators they chose honey over vinegar sending doctors and food supplies to the isolated villages that had helped the japanese in this way they hoped to win the locals back to the allied side rather than punish them for collaborating august brought an ally drive deep into burma and the bloody and brutal campaign to liberate the country merits its own video regardless may of 1945 saw the indian army successfully capture the burmese capital for india the war was over and the end could not have come soon enough food shortages were rampant even after the official end of the bengal famine in 1944 and basic necessities like cloth were in equally short supply demobilization meant an epidemic of unemployment as war workers were unceremoniously laid off members of the ina were arrested and interrogated but public outcry saw many of them spared prosecution some indians saw the ina as a legitimate member of the independence movement rather than japanese quizlings speaking of independence the british agreed to discussions with indian leaders regarding the possibility of indian statehood and released political prisoners as an opening gesture including gandhi independence soon became an inevitability and indian statehood talks opened tensions between hindus and muslims were a key issue of the negotiations leading to an agreement to partition the colonial territory into the hindu state of india and the muslim states of pakistan and east pakistan now known as bangladesh the results of these negotiations are outside the scope of our discussion today but suffice to say the liberated colony would experience some growing pains india would go into the second world war as a colony and emerge a pair of nations [Music] in terms of military dead india lost 87 000 soldiers in the fight against the axis but accounting for civilian dead in the bengal famine and other incidents the death toll rises to a staggering 2.2 million at a minimum the indian economy was devastated by the war despite being on the winning side and the country remains economically troubled into the modern day nevertheless india was able to throw off the shackles of colonialism kicking off a wave of decolonization in the aftermath of the second world war it is no hyperbole to say that indian troops and materiel were a substantial contribution to the total allied war effort a contribution paid for in the spilled blood and empty stomachs of those living on the subcontinent [Music] you\",\n",

germany's final attempt to wrestle back control of the war on the western front at this stage of the war germany was hemmed in on three sides and the nazis had few options to relieve the pressure an offensive in the east would simply be swallowed by the immense soviet red army while doubling down on the italian front would have only a marginal impact to hitler the natural option was a surprise push across the relatively lightly defended ardennes and a drive toward the dutch coast to force a wedge between the commonwealth and american forces and if he was lucky force the allies into a second evacuation like dunkirk the battle of the bulge is sometimes considered the climactic conclusion to the western front of the second world war a last-ditch attempt by a crumbling regime to avoid being

[Music] the vermost laid out their plans in the utmost secrecy code naming the offensive operation omran after a prussian patriotic anthem only a handful of hitler's closest commanders knew of the plan and each was forced to sign a pledge of secrecy on pain of death before learning its details regimental commanders meanwhile were only to be briefed the day before the attack was to take place to avoid tipping off the americans troops moved across the thickly forested eiffel region during the night and sheltered in villages by day with their vehicles concealed in barns maps were distributed only at the very last moment and total radio silence was observed consequently allied air reconnaissance completely failed to notice these new troop concentrations though made a high priority vasht omrin was a divisive operation field marshal wilhelm keitel was an ardent supporter but many other commanders remained skeptical believing the units would be better utilized in the defense of the reich general zigfried westfall was among those who did not believe the available forces could ever reach the river muse but refrained from raising any objections for fear of being labeled a defeatist gert von runstadt and valter model also agreed this was simply one of hitler's map fantasies although model saw the offensive as a final gamble he had no choice but to carry out the allies certainly didn't expect an attack the highest echelons of allied command assumed the germans were preparing a counter-attack against an american crossing of the river roar on the eve of the offensive british field marshal bernard montgomery said the shortages of german manpower equipment and resources precluded any offensive action on their part he wasn't far wrong field commanders knew fuel would be a major problem particularly in the difficult terrain of the ardennes the sixth panzer army under dietrich would advance in the north the fifth panzer army under hasso von manteufel in the center and eric brondenberger's seventh army would take the south the two panzer forces were to push toward antwerp while the infantry would protect the southern flank against general george s patton's third army dietrich was to cross the vital bridges over the river muse within the first 24 hours of the assault before pushing onto antwerp montoyfo meanwhile would capture brussels to reach the muse the germans first had to pass through the junctions at solvit and peston the capture of which was crucial for maintaining a stream of supplies to the advancing forces the sixth panzer army advancing toward manchau was given special priority by hitler it included the elite of the waffen-ss most notably komfrupa piper led by its ruthless namesake piper's unit consisting of roughly 4 800 men and 800 vehicles would form the vanguard of the northern thrust the offensive would be preceded by operation grife during which a special brigade trained under the command of ss colonel otto scorsemezi was to adopt american customs and infiltrate enemy lines dressed as american soldiers to capture key bridges eight of his nine jeep teams managed to slip through the net undetected cutting wires tampering with road signs and committing minor acts of sabotage one even managed to misdirect an entire infantry regiment the germans would not find themselves facing the cream of america's fighting men the american defenders comprised six divisions of seventh corps most of them brand new to the field or redeployed to the ardennes as a kind of working vacation after intense battle days before the attack the 106th infantry division heard tanks and other vehicles moving to their section of the front but their inexperience gave them no idea what it meant even the experienced 4th infantry division assumed the engine noises were merely one of folk's grenadier division replacing another in the early hours of december 16th the americans were torn from sleep by the screams of rockets and bone rattling pounding of field guns sepp dietrich's sixth panzer army had opened fire against known u.s army positions in the first action of the battle as the gi's scrambled out of their sleeping bags mantoyful who had decided to ignore hitler's insistence on an opening artillery barrage crossed the river sour in secret preferring to take the sleeping americans by surprise as he did so engineer battalions began bridging the river ur so the 116th second and 130th panzer lair could follow evidently the gambit succeeded a number of american soldiers panicked and fled one officer acknowledged that a few men broke under the strain wetting themselves repeatedly or vomiting or showing other severe symptoms many american positions were surrounded and captured but others were defended in stunning acts of bravery such as when lieutenant lyle j buch jr of the 99th division held a nol at lanzerat for the entire day with only 18 men they killed and wounded over 400 enemies at a cost of just one life the fierce resistance of the 99th held up comp group piper in particular in his impatience piper ordered his vehicles to push forward rapidly and to ruthlessly run down anything in their way even driving them through the american minefield at the cost of five panzers although the element of surprise counted for a lot the german advance was not a total success and suffered from numerous delays and errors early in the morning the 326th volks grenadier division advanced with the aim of blocking the roads to open and achen and prevent any american reinforcements coming in from the north however the germans own artificial moonlight a glow created by bouncing searchlights off clouds silhouetted the volks grenadiers perfectly against the mist and snow and the americans had themselves a turkey shoot forcing the 326th back within an hour the weather was a constant irritation german forces experienced horrendous conditions on the road and in terms of visibility which meant while they struggled to move the allies also struggled to impose their air power over the battlefield nevertheless on december 17th the germans were satisfied with their progress and morale was high a soldier in the third panzer grenadier division wrote i think the war in the west is again turning the main thing is that the war will soon be decided and i will be coming home again to my dear wife and we can again build a new home that day eisenhower ordered all reserve formations to the front he decided that bastogne through which the main roads leading to the muse passed was the obvious place to block the german advance the 101st and 82nd airborne divisions were immediately dispatched if the hundred and first could reach bastogne before montoyfel's spearhead perhaps these screaming eagles could turn the tide eisenhower had ample reason to be concerned piper had chosen to ignore the route mapped out by hitler due to muddy tracks instead capturing hunsfeld and bulingen where he seized a fuel dump unopposed at each village his men massacred american pows and local villagers piper committed his most heinous crime at bournier here he murdered 84 pows of the 285th field artillery observation battalion in what would become one of the most infamous episodes on the western front hereafter rumors of the ss massacres spread fear among the american forces in the south montoyful's fifth panzer army moved against the 28th division surrounding the ancient town of clerval which was defended heroically but ultimately fruitlessly by outnumbered and outgunned men despite this brave defense first army hq ended the day in somber spirits fearing the germans were on the verge of forming vital bridge heads over the muse the next day the germans continued their assault overrunning american positions in an attack against the last battalion of the second division just 197 americans survived the assault their final stand combined with artillery support helped save the rest of the division first army hq was hastily evacuated and moved to should fontaine but defenders at tuapong managed to stave off panzer grenadiers trying to cross the river searching for alternative routes piper found the forested slopes at la glaze impossible to traverse and the bridge over the river lien already blown up resistance prevented the germans from reaching best stone but u.s headquarters was still struck by paralysis by the end of the day general bradley still had no idea first army hq had been abandoned the americans were fighting and dying to protect an empty house on the 19th bradley and general patton were summoned to verdun to meet eisenhower the meeting led to a reorganization of the allied defense and thanks to intercepted german communications they now had a clearer idea of the lay of the land eisenhower insisted there would be no withdrawal behind the muse instead alexander patch's seventh army would extend northward to cover for part of patton's third army while patton himself would advance to bastogne to relieve the city's beleaguered defenders both sides continued to suffer heavy casualties over the next few days with repeated german attempts to capture bastogne repulsed by heavy american artillery bombardments nonetheless by the evening of the 21st the town was almost entirely surrounded despite resistance and delays the germans were confident one cheerful leutenant wrote to his wife you cannot imagine what glorious hours and days we are experiencing now it looks as if the americans cannot withstand our important push on the 22nd the german commander lutvids sent the americans a demand to surrender general anthony mcauliffe in charge of bastogne's garrison simply sent the words nuts in return yet the demand was a bluff lutwitz lacked the strength to annihilate the defenders preferring instead to wait for reinforcements or else starve the besieged men out the latter was a distinct possibility as the americans lacked resupply and had been constantly shelled if they didn't starve they may well have just broken the snow had returned too causing poor visibility with americans and germans frequently crossing each other's lines in the murk meanwhile another attack on soviet drove away the last of the american defenders there although traffic jams faced by the germans the following day would give the us army time to regroup and pull back to form a new line the next day marked a turning point the weather finally cleared the skies were suddenly filled with allied aircraft allowing transport planes to conduct a massive supply drop of ammunition fuel rations and medical supplies all around pestone meanwhile fighter bomber attacks proved extremely effective at breaking up german attacks as they were assembling however general patton struggled to punch through to bastogne and was repeatedly stymied by ruined bridges that had been blown up by american engineers earlier in the battle on the 24th acting chief of the general staff heinz guderian visited hitler to argue that the ardenne offensive had clearly failed to achieve its goals and was not worth continuing calling instead for renewed attention on the eastern front hitler however refused to withdraw he would have been cheered by an apparent german triumph early that morning when forward elements of the second panzer division reached cell this would be the furthest west the germans would reach during the battle but it would only be a fleeting victory ammunition and fuel were running dangerously low to the point that even a complete withdrawal from their positions had become impossible food too was short and by the time the allied troops had entered cell the following afternoon they encountered only famished and exhausted panzer troops that night was roonsted's turn to inform hitler the offensive had failed but still the fuhrer refused to order a withdrawal angrily dismissing him on the 26th patton finally relieved bastogne true to form patton arrived via a reckless charge straight through the asenwa and north into bastogne covered by artillery fire and air-dropped napalm it succeeded in driving a hole through german lines allowing troops and tanks from the 4th armored division to rush in and relieve the town by this point hitler no longer made any mention of antwerp instead bastogne was to become his symbol of victory and he wanted no effort spared in capturing it refusing to listen to the protestations of his commanders hitler ordered the creation of army group lutvitz out of the remains of his forces to crush the town's defenders the germans launched attack after attack against bastogne but by the beginning of 1945 total allied air superiority and relentless american artillery salvos had caused massive casualties german resistance and poor weather slowed the advance and by the 11th of january there were unmistakable signs that the germans were withdrawing at the end of the month the front line had been more or less restored to its position before the offensive and the germans had totally failed to reverse the course of the war and despite inflicting heavy casualties upon the americans they had only succeeded in delaying the inevitable total unconditional defeat just four months later [Music] you\",\n",

take the germans completely by surprise on the contrary the highest echelons of german command were well aware that an invasion was imminent and of the least possible threat the fuhrer was confident that the atlantic wall stretching from the border of spain to norway would not only repulse any allied landing but caused so many commonwealth and american casualties that the western allies would lose their capacity to continue the war fritz bye line a senior aide to erwin rommel in africa and later commander of the ponzer lair division at normandy held the debacle at diaper up as incontrovertible proof the allies could not manage an amphibious assault the series of successful allied amphibious landings in italy gave even hitler pause however and he placed rommel in charge of shoring up the defenses along the english channel rommel's task was an inevitable one concrete was at a premium with the lion's share of germany's supply going to the construction of hardened u-boat shelters per hitler's direct orders french laborers and italian pows were conscripted to improve the defenses turrets from captured french tanks were made into makeshift emplacements named to brooks after a jury-rigged reinforced firing pit italian soldiers had built with buried cement pipes in north africa and extensive minefields were laid perhaps rommel's most ingenious inventions were the ramelsbargle or rommel's asparagus webs of metal wire strung along fields of short poles meant to shred gliders as they tried to land alongside anti-ship mines placed into the beaches atop angled poles driven into the sand but static defenses were only part of rommel's strategy hitler and the high command had become convinced the allies would land at the easy to reach paddy clay operatives confirmed this loudly and often falling for the allied deception operation operation fortitude rommel for his part began to shift his view toward an allied landing at normandy the beaches were similar to the italian shore and the allies would want to maximize their chances of success by striking on familiar ground regardless of where the allies came rommel argued that the only way to beat them back was through defensive action on the beaches meeting the allies as they landed and denying them the opportunity to take even a centimeter of ground given the quality of the troops defending normandy this was far easier planned than executed normandy was the responsibility of the seventh army whose units in the area were to put it mildly of mixed quality promising recruits were siphoned off by ss falsehood or panzer recruiters leaving a contingent of unfit or unremarkable men among the defenders of normandy were the so-called ear and stomach battalions composed of soldiers convalescing from combat wounds to their abdomens or who were experiencing hearing loss and astropin foreign auxiliaries from conquered lands forced to fight for the reich including many soviet pows naturally most proved highly ineffective with many deserting to join the french resistance or surrendering to the allies at the first opportunity the few capable soldiers either suffered from endemic fatalism such as captain eberhard vegemon of the 21st panzer division who commented we were well aware that neither our men nor our tanks were good enough or were almost fanatically prepared to meet their foes this attitude was usually invinced by the younger ss troops as june 5th crept into june 6th the kriegs marina pulled patrols from the english channel german meteorologists had declared the weather unsuitable for an invasion through june 10th there was scientifically speaking no chance of a landing rommel took these assurances as an opportunity to go on leave returning to germany to celebrate his wife's birthday and arrange an audience with hitler to request additional panzers along the wall friedrich dolman commander of the 7th army ordered a command post drill for his officers on june 6th the evening was shaping up to be a quiet affair and the germans began preparing for the next day's routine until allied bombs began falling this itself was not unusual as the allies had launched near continuous runs against the germans for some time but this raid was an overture to operation overlord as centuries fought off sleep gliders began to make silent landings as officers crawled into bed paratroopers began to descend to earth bewildered german commanders found enemies literally raining down on their heads and desperately rang to their superiors or assembled cells of ad-hoc resistance lieutenant general joseph ryker commander of the 711th infantry division recalled a night of drinking in the officer's mess ending in combat the inebriated officer pistol in hand stumbled out into the night to find british paratroopers raining down on the 711ths command post riker and his men were able to fend off the assault and the still drunk general desperately rang to his superiors to announce the beginning of the allied invasion in the american landing zones lieutenant general wilhelm foley commander of the 91st luftwanda division was ambushed and killed by the 82nd airborne just behind his headquarters near soulmate igle other germans proved less willing to give battle reiner hartmetz a soldier serving near normandy rushed to his command post to find his officers gripped by battleshock two men were simply catatonic while reiner's company commander was sprawled drunkenly in a foxhole every time a runner brought news from the front line the commander would idly threaten to execute anyone who returned to the scene of the action as dawn began to light up the normandy coast the germans were shocked to see an allied armada steaming toward them with no naval forces to challenge them the allied landing craft and their escorts took up their positions in the english channel and that's when the shells began landing [Music] the opening bombardment of omaha beach caught german shore batteries in the middle of preparing for gunnery practice turning what should have been a morning of plinking in the atlantic into a scramble for survival weathering this bombardment was the 716th static infantry division a unit of notoriously low quality composed of decrepit or boyish conscripts and ill-motivated astrupan the division was denied the usual allotment of artillery and heavy vehicles their peers in the army enjoyed relying on a hodgepodge of german armaments and foreign heavy weapons but the 716th was not alone at omaha as other areas were defended by the much more powerful 352nd infantry division as battle was joined on the beach and american servicemen scrambled for cover machine gunner heinrich zavilo of the 352nd could see the water spouts where my machine gun bursts were hitting and when the little fountains got close to the gis they threw themselves down they lay in the shallow water many tried to get to the most forward beach obstacles to find some cover behind them i fired some more at the many dark foams in the water zavolo senior one lieutenant freyr king pitied the americans as poor swine even as he called more artillery strikes onto the floundering infantry all over the beach xavillo could see wounded moving around on the bloody watery slime mostly creeping trying to get to the upper beach and find some cover behind the shingle embankment one by one they would occasionally run in a crouch as the day went on men like xavillo and their heavy weaponry would make omaha the deadliest landing on d-day [Music] the 716th division at sword beach was a sorry affair the overstretched germans were severely lacking in air support or completed fortifications and had utterly failed to coordinate with coastal artillery in their sector the area teamed with vacation homes and coastal settlements and saved for summon placements in the sand dunes and a handful of beach obstacles was largely undeveloped the individual soldiers were also of low quality with lieutenant carl haida bemoaning the condition of his division's officers many had been severely wounded previously some became unpleasant or socially inept due to their early harsh war experiences i will not deny that some did get drunk at times lieutenant schaaf of the 716th noted that the rank and file were overworked and ill-motivated too busy putting up wire and planting rommel's asparagus to have much time for training indeed the mix of germans and astropin defending sword beach routinely invinced a lack of care as artilleryman hans glaub describes his fellow gunners failing to keep their pieces clean sword would prove to be a relatively smooth landing with the germans yielding the beach to british forces with minimum casualties their attitude would change when they met the more professional soldiers of the 21st panzer division launching a two-pronged counter-attack to the east and west of sword however major hans von luke commander of the eastern thrust wrote in his memoir panzer commander of attempting to lead the 2nd battalion of the 21st against dug in british paratroopers only to be stymied by allied aircraft and naval fire the german defense at utah beach was compromised by the airborne operations cut phone lines had crippled their ability to exchange information while the spread out landing zones made mounting a large-scale defense difficult utah and its environs were defended primarily by the 709th infantry division made up of older germans and the ever ubiquitous astrubin armed with a bizarre mix of weapons french german polish even russian armaments filled their stores but blessed with competent leadership at least lieutenant general carl wilhelm graf von schlieben overall commander of the 709th would order an actual organized counter-attack in the face of the airborne assault arranging for the 100th panzer battalion to drive forward to meet the 82nd airborne at salmer igle and at their critical bridgehead over the meridae the 100th would be driven back by the 82nd in spectacular fashion as the obsolete french tanks they deployed against the americans were annihilated with bazookas and gammon grenades but the 82nd were not the only paratroopers in the area the sixth paratroop regiment under the command of major font der haita pushed out of karenta to reinforce their ground-based colleagues as they came upon the americans landing zones the germans were astonished at the number of parachutes left behind yards and yards of silk littered the fields of france the falsehood yeager would push onto the commune solcom dumas where haita climbed the church steeple and saw the endless armada in the channel things were not much better for the germans on the beach proper lieutenant arthur yonka commanded fort w5 a network of bunkers and pillboxes built into the dunes over the beaches which was all but destroyed by the morning bombings janko recalled how the raids obliterated his position avalanches of sand and concrete buried his men alive forcing them to be dug out even as the assault on the beaches began spotting the american landing craft janka ordered what men he could rally to dig in and ordered a dispatch rider to make for the nearest artillery battery to shell the beach ianko's rider would be intercepted by american paratroopers there was little yanka and his men could do as the landings began in ernst with men and floating tanks fighting their way through the surf and straight toward the ruins of w5 a blast knocked janka to the ground and as his eyes fought to focus and the ringing in his ears subsided he looked up through his skewed spectacles to see an american infantryman standing over him as combat intensified on normandy and reports of paratroopers and an allied fleet flooded high command the general staff thought to themselves this is all an elaborate ruse the general staff passed this thought around as hitler slept in as more and more allied troops and heavy equipment began making their way onto the beaches hitler finally rolled out of bed to be met with word of the invasion of france the fuhrer could not have been happier hitler declared again that the atlantic wall would throw the allies back and he eagerly anticipated following up the inevitable failure of the normandy landings by reigning v1 bombs on london the western armies would be ground into the sands of france and the seat of his hated british enemies would be blown to smithereens by superior german weaponry but as the day dragged on and the allies began to gain ground the frontline commanders flooded high command with requests for support requests to do something to prevent their positions from being overrun the beacons of normandy were lit but high command would not answer the call for aid hitler the only man on earth who could release the panzers would continue to insist that the allies could and should be thrown back on the shore this thinking had managed to seep into some of the defenders on gold beach friedrich verster helped crew a battery of four captured czech cannons at marie fontaine near the beach verster firmly agreed with his fuhrer that the atlantic wall was impenetrable an attitude he kept right up until the british overran his commander's spotting position near the shore in the face of allied superiority in men and materiel verster and his fellows quietly surrendered further behind the lines the germans were hard at work trying to corral the french civilian population propaganda vans drove through calm ordering the population to remain indoors while the german authorities began to arrange for the evacuation of key parts of the city at van roonshet's headquarters outside of paris telephones rang continuously and teletypes spewed seemingly infinite messages combat at gold beach began in ernst when the first landing craft dropped their ramps the moment the metal hit the surf german machine guns and artillery opened up on the british troops who fought hard to clear the beach and sweep the fortified coastal houses the germans had worked into their defenses indeed the germans put up a fierce fight at gold with elements of the 352nd infantry raining fire on the british from a cliff top over the beach at amel including devastating volleys from a flak 88. the british were only able to unseat the germans at amel with tank support including a mortar armed member of hobart's funnies elements of the 12th ss division spotted the invasion fleet anchored off of juno beach in the early morning hours lieutenant peter hansman of the 12th recalled being awoken by his nco in charge shaking my shoulders here loidnant the invasion has started han's been rushed to a vantage point near gold beach looking through my binoculars i recognized the individual outlines of ships at irregular intervals flashes of ship's artillery were coming from various spots fast boats with high white foamy bow waves were spitting out brown clumps of men on the beach the lieutenant counted over 400 ships in the channel from his front row seat to the end of the third reich i wanted to shout at all the generals right up to adolf hitler over here quickly before it's too late whoever can still fight come here the fastest most powerful divisions send them here the luftwaffe where is it the kriegs marina where is it it must get here grenadier hans viner who defended a position on juno dubbed wn-31 recalled watching the first tommy's jumping into the sea which was quite shallow the bullets hit them and their boats to good effect and i was a little surprised to see them falling i don't know why weiner's position was eventually torn apart by the tanks coming ashore with the canadians which managed to drive inland under the barrel of 88 millimeter cannons poised to shred them as they emerged from the surf 88 millimeter gunner hyrik zebel complained of not being able to see many tanks due to the smoke and chaos though his gun claimed at least two allied tanks before their block house ii was blown apart the germans provided a much tougher obstacle for their foes at the tai ville chateau roughly one mile or one and a half kilometers inland thai villa was supposed to be the starting point for a second line of defensive works laid out by rommel before the allied landings came it was a well-built strong point with a full communication and command complex and underground tunnels connecting it to to brook turrets armed with machine guns cannons and mortars the defenders managed to hold the allies back until nearly 6 pm that day with their final message before the position was taken reading hand-to-hand fighting inside the command post hemmed into a closely confined area but still holding out heil hitler not long after the fall of tyvil the canadians began making their way toward the luftwaffe airfield at copykat one of their key objectives the commandant of the airfield ordered an evacuation inciting panic in his ground cruise the germans made a hurried attempt to destroy the aircraft before they evacuated but their haste proved fatal attempts to raise the airfield left most of the taxiing area of the runway untouched the takeoff runway was damaged but not sufficiently to render it unusable and the vast majority of the field's fuel stores were salvageable in this one case haste ended up lessening waste from the invasion of poland all the way up until d-day the story of the second world war is told from the perspective of the ascendant nazi germany the bronze eagle casting a wide shadow over the history of the early war but from the very moment the first allied boot makes landfall in normandy the narrative changes and the rest of the war is studied almost exclusively from the allied perspective we hope you have enjoyed hearing these personal recollections from german soldiers on normandy and agree with us that it is important to know the thoughts of even those on the wrong side of history for it is only by seeing both sides of a conflict that one can form a complete picture [Music] you\",\n",

following the acts of the union in 1707 a newly formed british army was established succeeding the prior english and scottish armies and their predecessor the new model army almost immediately this newborn military force equipped with dog lock muskets was thrust into battle during the war of the spanish succession suffering severe losses at the phyric victory at malpleche as it would become popularized the red tunic of the british army would be cemented in its military tradition for centuries in contrast to their lower ranked counterparts the elite officer class brandished edged weapons as components of their status and position as leaders this practice to carry such an item into combat would carry on for many decades into the modern era although its practical use decreased over time defeating the french during the battle of varberg along with their hanoverian allies british grenadiers during this time were equipped with brown bass muskets and their peculiar grenadier caps the brown bass would remain in british military service for over a hundred years with variations and improvements over that period of time the east india company set up by the british as a joint stock company for trades within the region of the indian ocean saw indians being enlisted into various presidency armies until 1857 these formations served under the british army across multiple campaigns chiefly on the sub-continent in the effort of colonial expansion british forces would find a number of their own muskets being used against them during the american war for independence those fighting the british army would refer to their oppressors as bloody backs and on occasion redcoats in reference to their long-standing uniforms those who stayed loyal to the crown wore blue or green in contrast although eventually they conformed to wearing the red uniforms grenadiers continued to serve as elite specialized formations during the war for independence grenadiers would continue to be armed similarly to their line infantry counterparts although on occasion utilizing an older long land pattern that had been supplanted by the short land pattern grenadiers were common on the battlefield with a company being found in every line infantry battalion they would continue to maintain their distinct status as disciplined top-tier troops supplemented by the increasing use and popularity of the british grenadiers march by this era in portugal a coalition landing force led by sir arthur wellesley defeated the outnumbered french division posted near the village of holisa catching the nickname of the grasshoppers riflemen of the 95th rifles wore a more distinctive green uniform in contrast to their red line infantryman counterparts although this was a popular color choice of similarly armed formations in the era the color would become synonymous with various other british rifle formations in history this would also see the acceptance and issue of the british made baker rifle supplanting the older smoothbore muskets in 1814 the british army would return to the united states making a drive for the white house itself and burning it down line infantrymen would continue to be armed with the india pattern brown bass musket with minor improvements in standard equipment in comparison to their counterparts 40 years ago while ultimately this was an inconclusive conflict as both the british empire and canada and the us withdrew from their respective front lines the empire would continue to be engulfed in campaigns in europe with the raging napoleonic wars the highland soldiers of the 42nd regiment of foot royal highlanders nicknamed the blackwatch fought valiantly in the battle of waterloo complete in dress with their distinctive patterned kilts the kilts originate as a traditional dress garment of gaelic men and those in the scottish highlands during the 16th century and continue to be worn in certain military formations to this day with regiments claiming their own unique patterns the british army fought valiantly alongside their french allies in the chaotic battle of inkerman in 1854 the era saw the introduction of the rifle musket into british service with first the p-51 monet rifle and then the p-53 enfield rifle musket in the crimea the majority of the british infantry were armed with the rifle musket although around one-fifth of the infantry deployed at the beginning of the war still carried the smoothbore p-42 percussion cap musket by the midpoint of the war in 1855 the army of the east as it was known was completely armed with the rifle musket and the remainder of the british army deployed at home and around the world would soon follow suit with a push for economic opportunities in southeast asia more specifically china the british military came into conflict twice over opium and other trade disputes while proper rifles were not the main armament across the army it had further become the standard issue weapon of the line infantrymen alongside their french allies the city of canton that numbered in nearly a million had been captured by a force of six thousand within the region the indian rebellion of 1857 had also taken place although a failed revolt this propelled the british army to more widely adopt a simpler khaki field uniform rather than to be dressed in ornate and brightly colored garments although suffering a notable disaster at isla wanna in january of that year works drift fought later the same day was a hard-fought victory for the british army although continuing to be clad in their traditional red and blue uniforms they were armed with the relatively new and very effective rifle the martini henry which had replaced the recently adopted snyder enfield rifle although this was a time of significant tactical change in the british army it was found that more traditional close order tactics were found to be most effective against the swift moving and aggressive zulu army the 24th regiment of foot and gonville bromhead would be immortalized in their actions in the 1964 film zulu the traditional red uniforms had by this era become a true liability in combat to counter this khaki now became the authorized dress for all foreign service in the late 1890s the boar wars notably during the disastrous events of black week and bloody sunday taught many lessons to the british army in field craft musketry and logistics these lessons would be refined and would stand the british army in good steed as it entered the great war this era also saw the introduction to the lee family of rifles which would be in british military service throughout the 20th century by the start of the great war the bright uniforms and flashy color facings were long done away with for field service in their place was an improvised khaki service dress that allowed the soldier to better blend in with his surroundings the main weapon for the average rifleman was the mark iii smle the officer corps wore mostly the same khaki colored uniform as their enlisted counterparts it was privately purchased of normally higher quality and differing in detail in addition to a traditional sword at their side most carry the webley mark vi revolver across all ranks a simple peaked cap with a regimental badge was worn head injuries increased significantly as soldiers who would have died otherwise were now better protected from above this steel combat headgear cemented itself as part of the british soldier for several decades until the 1950s as well as seeing use by the american expeditionary force and us military as a whole until relegated to civilian use in 1941. with the ferocious blitzkrieg across western europe the british army was pushed further and further to the coast of dunkirk where an evacuation of colossal scale took place along with the iconic number one mark iii lee enfield rifle the rifleman was given a new battle dress a full wool ensemble worn by all ranks with the distinct waist cut top that influenced the ike jacket the united states would adopt in later years formulated by david sterling under the name el detachment this commando force would be used to operate behind enemy lines not through airborne insertion but via jeeps during its second mission during operation crusader it successfully destroyed over 60 enemy aircraft notably the parachute wings of this elite unit were prominently worn above their left pocket sterling the sas's brainchild stated that the wings were treated as metals in their own right during their operations they adapted the tropical uniform for the desert heat dating back to the board of ordnance in the 15th century the british royal engineers have been responsible for all military engineering and technical functions as a combat support service in the british army as a whole sappers in this role would have responsibilities in fortifying defenses as well as handling mines both to plant and diffuse especially in the flat open terrain of north africa the diapered formerly known as operation jubilee was an operation all too similar to what the d-day landings would pursue two years later the american-made thompson submachine gun given to british commandos allowed a single soldier an increase in available firepower the commandos themselves were formed from volunteers and trained for raids within german occupied europe at the request of winston churchill it should be noted that outside of the commando force nearly 80 percent of troops allocated to this operation were canadian unfortunately this would be a failed operation to test the metal of hitler's atlantic wall operation market garden became widely known as the largest yet most disastrous allied airborne operation despite this the red devils of the british parachute regiment fought tooth and nail against their heavily armed enemy which also included their german counterparts the falsehood their signature red beret and wings were the icon of the airborne force by this point the sten submachine gun had been improved with a rear sight derived from the standard bolt action rifle and a higher degree of manufacturing quality the denison smox became the first major widespread adoption of camouflage by the british army and would continue to be used for decades the british army deployed the 27th commonwealth brigade during the korean war being made of british canadian australian indians who served as medics and new zealanders a uniform developed for the warmer climates was issued for troops first arriving in korea although a winter uniform had been made up from u.s cold weather gear stocks worn on top of a warm jumper ultimately the armament and web equipment would remain similar as it did in the previous war british malaya would be engulfed in a guerrilla war just as vietnam would be a decade later communist forces fought for independence against the british ultimately successful in defeating the communists the conflict would see the resurgence of the special air service and would also see troops from many parts of the commonwealth including australians new zealanders as well as a large contingent of gurkhas the tough and hardy men from nepal had considerable experience in jungle conditions as had been found in burma during the second world war these forces would be the strong backbone during this conflict at the iranian embassy in london six armed men vying for the kuzastan province's sovereignty had taken 26 people hostage for several days by the sixth day with no progress made for compromise the sas was deployed repelling down from the building's rooftop and making their forceful entry into the embassy the sas forces were equipped with the reliable german-made mp5 submachine gun a popular now iconic choice for many police and special units the operation overall was a resounding success and thrusted this elite unit into the public eye for the first time and the sas was looked upon for expertise for counter-insurgency tactics april 2nd 1982 kicked off the falklands war argentina invaded the falkland islands and south georgia the following day in response the british forces deployed a naval task force to counter the argentinian forces and conducted an amphibious assault on the islands the rifleman conducting the assault were issued the l1a1 self-loading rifle a british made a licensed copy of the belgian fn fal and by this point camouflage uniforms were standard for the british army the conflict would end within 10 weeks although interestingly this was never a declared war between either nation with the onset of the gulf war the british army deployed alongside coalition forces like other nations operating in the middle east a desert camouflage uniform was created to blend in better against the arid terrain the british rifleman was now given an assault rifle the la-85a1 although several flaws had been discovered from its service in the sand-dominated environment these were improved upon when the war in afghanistan began in 2004. adopted in 2010 the multi-terrain pattern replaced both the original dpm and desert patterns in a way the british army accomplished what the u.s failed in adapting an effective universal camouflage pattern during this time the a3 upgrade was applied to the current service rifle to address various flaws and make improvements as the years went on all soldiers complete their 14-week basic training at army training center perbrite as well as the necessary skills and trades for their chosen service within the army for routine ceremonial duties the british soldier is smartly dressed in a khaki tunic and trousers with some differences depending on the unit they are serving in in addition the uniform is augmented with a distinctive peaked cap or beret in traditional colors for example in the rifles the uniform features black buttons versus the more generic brass a distinct green peaked cap or beret black belts and straps as well as distinct regimental insignia adorned on their headgear and belts all ranks wear the same style and cut although officers are to purchase certain items it would be a disservice not to mention the most iconic and recognizable uniform of the modern british army that of the regiments of the foot guards the distinct scarlet tunic and black bearskin cap are the hallmarks of this uniform and although a form of bare skin cap has been seen in british service since the 1700s the current version dates from after the battle of waterloo in 1815 when all ranks of the first or grenadier regiment of foot guards were permitted to wear it as a result of their role in defeating the imperial guard in that battle in 1831 all regiments of foot guards were granted permission to wear the bare skin cap a tradition maintained to this day where it is worn for ceremonial or public duties at various locations including buckingham palace the individual regiments of which there are five in seniority the grenadier cold stream scots irish and welsh guards are recognizable by their button placements and plumes in their caps they're not just ceremonial soldiers and they take their place on operations and deployments around the world equipped with the standard british service rifle these scarlet sentries stand silent on post and

of soviet oppression hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian when one thinks of the eastern front of the second world war images of conflict between the ideological juggernauts of nazi germany and the soviet union spring to mind while a critical component of the second world war there was another key conflict that took place in the background of the early war years the winter war between the soviet union and finland after breaking away from the russian empire in 1917 finland experienced a civil war which saw anti-communists win control of the new nation the soviet union who had backed finland's communist faction looked hungrily on the former territory of their imperial forbearers and planned an invasion in this latest episode of our verses series we will compare the infantry of the

match up we will inhabit two distinct time periods our first two matches will occur during the time of the winter war which was fought from november 1939 to march 1940. our final battle will take place during the continuation war from june 1941 to september 1944. these battles are based on soviet and finnish squad tactics and equipment however we will be discounting heavy equipment such as armored vehicles and while the use of artillery may be woven into the narrative of the engagements it will not be a deciding factor as always these combat encounters are fictional and represent our opinion based on our research and perspective with that it's time to button up and join the action in finland 1940 [Music] the soviet infantry can't help but feel an odd sense of comfort as they march along a rough-hewn forest trail the smooth white dunes the familiar chill in the breeze a rhythmic crunching beneath their boots it almost feels like home but their revere is interrupted by a thunderous crack it's an ambush the soviets scramble as another shot clips the squad leader the sergeant falls grasping at his arm he's winged but still in the fight hidden among the trees a squad of finnish infantry fire a ragged volley with their m27 rifles a staccato chorus of reports echoing through the trees the soviets dive into the drainage ditches alongside the trail clearing their rifles for action one brave soul cautiously leans out of cover mosin nagant poised to fire on the first fin he sees but a finn sees him first two soviets down nine to go the sergeant orders covering fire while their dp-28 is set up if they play their cards right they can leap frog away from the trail and into the other side of the trees the soviets fire wildly sending an endless stream of shots towards the trees their shots splinter wood and churn slush succeeding installing the fins for a moment and that's all the time they need the assistant machine gunner slaps an ammunition tray onto the dp giving his comrade a quick tap on the shoulder and with a high-pitched chug like a typewriter the soviet machine gun opens fire as the dp sends a stream of bullets into the thick forest canopy the soviet infantry brake cover to pull back toward the safety of the trees behind them the finns dig in weathering the barrage they've seen these soviets tactics before and know that their moment will come the sergeant calls to his men and they take cover among these snow drifts to lay down cover with their mosens as the dp gunner and his assistant rush to catch up with their comrades a group of fins sortie from the trees skiing into position behind a low stone wall one brings up his kp 31 sub machine gun racking it around from his impressive 71 round drum magazine before sending out a wide spray firing his compact smg like a squad support weapon the wild fuselaid sends the two-man soviet lmg team scrambling keeping their heads down as they desperately try to cover distance as their finnish enemies and soviet comrades exchange fire lucky shots down a pair of finnish riflemen and the finnish squad leader signals his men to advance the finns have the initiative and they intend on keeping it as the haggard lmg team catches up with the soviet rifleman the sergeant orders his men to make a break for the forest the finns quickly strap on their skis flying from the forest to keep pace with their retreating foes the soviets make it to the opposite side of the woods and the finnish squad leader suddenly signals a halt he knows the area as these soviets rush through the forest looking back to ensure the fins aren't following they come upon a frozen lake in their panic they don't think to check the ice what the hot lead of the finnish infantry couldn't accomplish the icy waters of the cola river soon will the finns take the first match through their superior usage of guerilla tactics and knowledge of the terrain especially in the early years of the winter war the soviets deployed without winter clothing and camouflage the reds greens and browns of their uniforms making them easy targets in the endless white of the finnish tundra overconfidence and inexperience among soviet officers would often lead to disaster such as here when the soviet sergeant thought he was saving his squad by pulling back into the trees and instead sent his men into an icy grave of note is the finn's use of skis at the conclusion of the match reflecting their highly mobile disposition throughout the war if the soviets hadn't blundered upon a frozen river it's likely the finns would have overtaken them with their ski troops with this match decided let's see if these soviets can eke out a win in a more conventional engagement as the first shells of the soviet bombardment fall the reminds the squad he's attached to of their dedication to the soviet union and their responsibility to their fellow workers with the propaganda out of the way the squad leader orders his men to charge these soviet conscripts fill the air with their famous war cry a finnish squad takes up positions in the trenches as the soviets surge forward opening fire with their rifles they take cover behind rocks and fallen trees stymied by a line of barbed wire strung among the debris of the forest their dp opens up on the finish trench attempting to force the defenders heads down but it's quickly answered by a finnish maxim gun stationed in the bunker a lone soviet manages to cut through the wire clearing the way for his fellows only to be strafed by the finnish kp-31 the maxim has the soviet machine gun well and truly suppressed isolating the russians between the trench and its field of fire the squad leader orders his men the only way they can go forward grenades fly at the finish trench causing the fins to scatter for cover three fall in the shrapnel and explosions the rest scrambling to retake their positions as the soviets surge forward the finnish squad leader orders his men to pull back to the second trench line and they withdraw under scattered fire from mosin the gods the maxim team hurriedly tries to pull out of their positions but they're taken out by the soviets as the last of the fins withdraw the soviets level their rifles and are engulfed in flames the rear-most finns pelt the trench with molotovs turning the dugout into a fire pit the soviet squad leader orders his surviving man to halt and is immediately set upon by the commissar as the finns open fire with their rifles and smg the commissar exhorts his charge forward for the glory and survival of the ussr but the squad leader orders a withdrawal to a better position the commissar says this is unacceptable they must attack but the squad leader formally orders his men to reposition in the west in an attempt to flank the finns the commissar draws his handgun a frontal charge must be ordered to overwhelm the finns while they're vulnerable or else the commissar will shoot the sergeant where he stands reasoning his odds are better in battle than in an execution the soviet squad leader reluctantly complies the soviet rifles surge forward circling around the flames as the fins pick them off ironically one of the first to fall is our friend the commissar and with the ideologue dead the soviet squad leader orders his men to cover it's time to do the sensible thing cut their losses and pull back the manor heimlin has held it's two nil finland after our first two engagements the manor heim line was a source of great embarrassment for these soviets as the creatively laid out defenses of simple earthworks and scattered reinforced bunkers combined with the naturally inhospitable terrain to create a killing zone that claimed many soviet lives furthermore the flexible defense used by the finns enabled them to yield ground without fear of losing the overall integrity of their line in this particular fight the soviets were hamstrung by their commissar's insistence on a frontal assault a tactic closely associated with these soviets though not as ubiquitous as popular media would have us believe in reality the manor heim line held out so well that it forced soviet planners to fundamentally alter their goals in the winter war and ultimately allowed finland to end the war by ceding territory rather than being totally annexed by the ussr but this was not the last time the soviets would face the finns in battle they would meet again in the continuation war and it is here that we join our final battle a door-to-door match up in the streets of the finnish city of vipory soviet and finnish soldiers exchange fire from the windows of high rises the horizon dances with the flashes of artillery and columns of fire as they hit their marks rubble and bodies litter the streets the soviets have broken through to vipery a key position along the finnish defensive line and are engaged in the brutal business of urban warfare in the market square of vipery soviet troops have dug into the round tower a historic fortification opposing them a finnish squad has taken up a position just across the street trying to keep the russians in place until reinforcements can arrive within the tower a group of infantry prepare too sorty these are not common conscripts though this is a storm group foreign foreign the storm group pours from the side of the round tower their dp opening up from the loopholes to cover them as they surge forward the soviets leapfrog from cover to cover trading fire with the finnish rifleman but their ppshs are good for little other than suppression at this range the finnish squad leader has been outfitted with an additional two kp-31 smgs but their three submachine gunners hold fire until the soviets closed distance experience has taught them that the kp is many things but a substitute for an lmg is not one of them the storm group presses forward the dp covering their advance as the finnish riflemen attempt to pick them off before they can close if these soviets get into smg range the finns would be facing the belching ends of the infamous burp gun a lucky shot finds its mark on the dp gunner silencing the lmg but the storm group leader orders his men to rush as he deploys a smoke grenade and in response the finnish squad leader orders his kp gunners to the front the kps pour bullets from their deep magazines firing wildly into the smoke and as a gentle breeze carries the acrid fumes away the fins stare down their sights at an empty street the finnish squad leader instinctively scratches his head where's the charge the finnish squad leader orders his men inside a building better to dig in one of the apartment blocks than face an enemy you can't see the fins pull into the nearest building gathering in the lobby to strategize the squad leader will take two men to secure the second floor and provide overwatch while the assistant squad leader and the rest of the squad maintain security downstairs the three inch up the stairs breaching the first apartment to find some very bewildered rats as the three fins fan out the squad leader wonders if the storm group made a break for it he hears them below he signals the two riflemen with him and they take cover behind overturned furniture weapons leveled at the door someone's coming up the door inches open a stick grenade tumbles into the room when his vision clears the business end of a ppsh is leveled right between his eyes the soviets take our final match of our trio of battles bringing the overall score to 2-1 finland though they gave urban warfare little thought in their initial tactical manuals the soviets quickly became experts in the subject following their hard-won victories at stalingrad and elsewhere where the concept of the storm group was developed and tested it is this experience that gave them the edge in the streets of vipori leaving the finns no hope to match soviet tenacity and experience in this challenging battlefield but while the soviets proved dominant in an urban setting overall it is the finns who we believe fielded the superior squad the finn's highly maneuverable units enabled them to ski circles around the russians fighting equally well as guerilla infantry or flexible defenders of the manor heim line do you agree with our assessment let us know in the comments along with any suggestions you might have

       " \" hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian in this episode we will attempt to plumb the depths of desperation and fanaticism that were the final days of the second world war in the panic-stricken minds of both hitler and his high command the grinding days of 1943 to 1945 were a delusional period for germany a heady cocktail of crushing reality stirred in with ideological blindness steering an intoxicated nazi leadership towards ever more extreme measures in their bid for nz or ultimate victory we will look at the dismal situation nazi germany faced at the end of the war and examined the insidious ways that hitler and his generals planned to achieve their enzig or else to punish what they saw as the cowardly german population that dared to betray their fuhrer as

the soviets and nazis battered but the soviets can weather the beating the retreat is draining germany's oil the soviets are draining germany's manpower and the privations of war are draining germany's hope joseph goebbels infamous minister of propaganda and the man who convinced a nation that millions of innocents just had to die takes to the podium to sell the german people on the words emblazoned on the banners overhead totally total war is like [Music] [Applause] knows whether the people were willing to follow or not to a taller krieg wouldn't save the third reich the failure of operation fall blow or case blue was a major contributor to the eventual access defeat on the eastern front although many will argue that the invasion of the soviet union operation barbarossa was doomed from the start launched in june of 1942 case blue was an attempt to simultaneously cut off soviet access to resupply from the black sea and capture the oil fields located in the caucasus the oil wells of baku were of paramount importance as germany had exhausted its pre-war petroleum reserves yet ironically the operation designed to address this shortage only exacerbated it as the marathon drive toward caucasia and the scorched earth defense by soviet forces stretched already fragile fuel lines leaving their offensives in the east all but dead in the water case blue culminated in the battle of stalingrad which marked the deepest penetration of nazi troops into the soviet union but although they inflicted grievous losses on the red army the offensive was ultimately turned back along with practically all of the momentum on the eastern front germany went into the caucasus for oil and triumph but left with empty tanks and full graveyards as bad as this situation was nazi officials had reason for some confidence the allied raid at dieppe france in august of 1942 was an embarrassing failure and a windfall for the german propaganda ministry indicating that the allies lacked the expertise to launch an amphibious invasion of europe the luftwaffe also regularly inflicted heavy casualties on allied bomber sorties giving hope that they could still win the war in the air in the long term this optimism was strengthened with the knowledge that cutting-edge jet fighters like the me262 might enter production within a year but these dreams became increasingly far-fetched as germany's answer to its logistical challenges was the creation of ever more complex wunderwaffe or wonder weapons that created more of the same challenges v2 rocket systems to reign holy terror on petulant londoners stg44s that would influence modern assault rifles mouse tanks to grind the judeo-bolsheviks into dust and other incredible inventions that were largely either too expensive ineffective or impractical fuel was a constant concern with the vermost juggling supplies of petrol and synthetic gas to power its desperate operations far more sinisterly the germans relied on slave labor from concentration camp inmates who suffered both from the malice of their oppressors as well as industrial accidents all of these issues saw albert speer hitler's armaments minister and the man with his hands on the levers of german industry playing an ever more challenging game of the floor is lava economic edition fritz reinhart state secretary in the german finance ministry reportedly said the contributions that have been allocated to paying off the interest and principle on the national debt must henceforth be covered by current revenues earned from the economic exploitation of the eastern territories this economic exploitation one of the many schemes designed to remedy germany's excessive spending paradoxically worsened the german economic condition in large part because the scheme was falsely predicated on a quick and decisive military conquest but hitler and his advisors hardly concerned themselves with these practical considerations they had nazi ideology which elevated the war to an apocalyptic struggle between the superior aryan race and the untermensch who stood between them and the mastery of europe early success in poland and france had taught the nazi party that shortcomings in strategy or logistics could be overcome by raw germanic prowess encouraging blind belief in nazi supremacy and downplaying objective analysis of defeats or strategic blunders after all as hitler said regarding operation barbarossa all the germans had to do was kick the door in and the entire structure would come crashing down that they kept having to find more doors to kick was another matter even after the failure of case blue hitler tried to keep the army on an offensive footing but his plans were constantly postponed meanwhile soviet winter counter-offensives made inroads on nazi-held territory forming a salient around the city of kursk with summer approaching hitler authorized operation citadel a massive attack on this salient by army group center and army group south what followed is often considered one of the largest tank battles in history the luftwaffe and panzer divisions exhausting themselves trying to break through the soviet defenses and envelop the salient yet this salient would ultimately hold and operation citadel represented everything wrong with the german war effort it was a reactionary move based on vague strategic goals that even if successful would merely delay the inevitable after the failure at kursk the german disposition would permanently shift to the defensive even so german morale endured the disaster at kursk and the vermost remained an effective fighting force throughout 1943 this was primarily due to the efforts of men like volter model and albert kesselring who effectively transitioned the german army to a defensive posture hopes rested on a series of fortifications constructed along the dinap river sometimes known as the ostwal despite hurling up to three million soviet soldiers at the ostwall in august the red army was unable to cross the dniper for nearly three months meanwhile in the west the allied invasion of italy was brought to a standstill at the gustav line in december as winter set in hitler hoped that germany could hold out until the unholy alliance between the capitalist western allies and the communist ussr collapsed under its own ideological weight unfortunately for germany reality finally came knocking on hitler's door in june of 1944 when the normandy landings blew through the atlantic wall and cost germany nearly half a million casualties while operation bagration in the east shattered the german's precious battle lines at the cost of around four hundred thousand men with germany's forces being ground to a pulp by these soviets romania and bulgaria defected in 1944 and the panicked germans occupied hungary to prevent their defection even as the hungarian prime minister begged the soviets for a separate peace though german ferocity delayed the allied advance they could not match their superiority in men materiel and air power hemorrhaging manpower and with hardly any supplies or economic strength remaining the germans had to get creative to replace their mounting losses in addition to raising 78 volks grenadier divisions and moving extant regiments around to create new armies on paper the germans made a desperate attempt to augment their forces in the form of the volksterm or peoplestorm on october 18th 1944 hitler personally ordered that all civilian males aged 16 to 60 join a new force that would continue to protect the reich the volksterm was not an organ of the vermost which hitler was beginning to see as weak and incompetent but rather a paramilitary militia controlled by the nazi party allied intelligence at the time estimated that at full strength the volksderm could have mustered over 13 million fighters to oppose the march to berlin less than half that number could put up an honest fight the volksgerm were initially issued whatever uniforms could be scrounged up but as the logistical situation deteriorated their only standard piece of equipment became a black and red armband identifying them as members of the militia which led to members fighting in everything from civilian business suits to hand-me-down imperial german kits from the first world war the volksderm were armed with a hodgepodge of civilian hunting rifles weapons captured from allied and scandinavian countries and surprisingly ingenious last-ditch weapons an example of this last category was the eintos flahmenverfer a portable single-shot flamethrower the eintos was essentially an oversized aerosol bottle designed to fire a single half second gout of flame before being discarded in the same vein as the single shot panzerfaust such a weapon would have been as simple as point and roast making it perfect for civilian users german resistance would not end at the front line however joseph goebbels launched a massive propaganda push centered around a partisan network verwolf which would in theory continue the war even in the event of a german defeat people the foolish allies would take for friendly civilians would in fact be hardened fighters with national socialism burning in their hearts and ready to transform at any moment into a fighting force to sow discord and strife among the allies nazi partisans would in reality carry out or take credit for numerous assassinations and sabotage operations during the final years of the war but the massive organization goebbels wrote about was never a serious threat with wunderwaffe in hand the germans would win the war maybe the fuhrer realized that only a grand offensive could now conclude the war for germany favorably the question was where it stood the best chance of success as action against the soviets or in italy would bear little fruit there was however one sector which had historically served the german army well hitler no doubt fueled by a sense of 1940 nostalgia ordered a massive armored attack through the lightly defended ardan region his goal was to drive onto antwerp and isolate the commonwealth forces in holland knocking them out of the war and forcing britain into another dunkirk to save what soldiers would be left perhaps even triggering negotiations for peace and freeing up german troops to finally defeat the inferior soviets in the east hitler was proven partly right in his predictions when the offensive code-named operation vacht omrine took the american defenders by complete surprise causing panic in their lines however in a characteristic display of hubris hitler and his high command had not only severely underestimated the fighting prowess of the american army which after the initial shock continued to provide tenacious resistance on key crossroads and towns all over the ardennes but they had also failed to provide their army with enough fuel exhausted and under-supplied the battered remnants were ultimately ordered to withdraw entirely when a strong allied counter-attack forced its way through their weakened lines hitler's final gamble had utterly failed and with it germany's last military reserves so desperately needed to repel the forthcoming winter offensive on the eastern front had been spent germany's remaining defenders now had their work cut out for them in january 1945 the soviets built on the momentum of operation bagration to launch the vestula odor offensive a crushing drive into poland that saw germany lose their first conquest of the war with renowned field marshal yorgi zhukov at the head the soviets obliterated 45 divisions and claimed to have killed or captured hundred thousand men stopping at the oda river bordering the fatherland the propaganda minister recorded a feeling of utter terror sweeping through the capital of the reich as the citizens of berlin worried that the soviets had a clear path to the city there is nothing between us no anti-tank gun no anti-tank obstacles not a single [Music] soldier this would not be true for long the luftwaffe's first fleeger division under noted tank hunter hans orrich rudel was stationed in the defense of the city and high command hoped to use the planes to pick off soviet tanks crossing the frozen odor german engineers on the ground would blast the ice in non-combat areas there would be bombers where the soviets were and a moat where the soviets were not but the blasting proved to be ineffective against the thick ice with even power saws unable to inflict lasting damage the oda river was quick to heal its wounds with fresh ice this state of affairs would continue through early february when a warmer weather and the thawing of the odor river enabled the germans to launch a last-ditch defensive with rudel's planes sorting out from quickly assembled defenses on the german side to eliminate soviet tanks it was one such sortie that ended rudel's flying career after dive bombing 12 soviet tanks the panzer crocker moved on a 13th kill only for his engine to blow driving white-hot debris into his leg brutal limped back to his airstrip barely alive in a way this episode is a metaphor the germans continued to fight against a superior foe even as their own equipment and leadership betrayed them germany soldiers had little choice in the matter numerous members of the high command had so thoroughly bought into the party's propaganda that they either sincerely believed that the third reich would still prevail somehow or that if they were going to lose the war they should take as many intervention as possible with them clearerheads were well aware of the war crimes and brutality nazi germany had inflicted upon the world and feared summary execution by the soviets or a slower trial and execution from the western allies both situations bred an atmosphere of determination worthy of bushido creating a clique of leaders who were determined to die fighting for the fuhrer and the men under their command had little choice but to follow suit the situation was equally dire for civilians as those who refused conscription into the volksderm were summarily hanged and displayed as warnings to their neighbors even germans in liberated regions weren't safe in the city of achen the americans installed lawyer franz openhoff as governor a veriwolf unit of ss and hitler youth members as young as 16 killed openhalf not long thereafter germany held out far longer than many would suspect partially out of ideological fervor but primarily out of fear either of allied justice or of soviet or nazi reprisals even with this intoxicating mix of fear and zeal in the air hitler came to believe that the german people were not only weak but had betrayed their fuhrer and cost themselves the chance for racial domination his paranoia reached its zenith in march 1945 when albert speer presented hitler with a report stating the economy could hold out for another month perhaps too spears reports ended with an uncharacteristically humanitarian plea urging his fuhrer to consider the safety and survival of the german people and to make provisions for them in the post-war world hitler's alleged response displayed the ruthlessness he perceived his subjects lacked he exclaimed if the war is lost the people will be lost also it is not necessary to worry about what the german people will need for elemental survival on the contrary it is best for us to destroy even these things if the german economy would not hold if the people could not rally behind him to be led to enzig and if germany was to fall to the allies then the foes of fascism would not inherit a nation they would inherit a ruin it was around this time that the holocaust was rapidly intensified as resources were depleted and territory was lost the nazis saw an imperative to accelerate their extermination of the lesser races before it was too late jewish ghettos across poland and occupied europe were emptied their occupants shipped off to extermination camps by the tens of thousands this was the nazi's last grasp at implementing their final solution to their jewish question on march 19 1945 hitler issued the decree concerning demolitions in the reich territory or as history would remember it the nero decree ordering the total destruction of all communications manufacturing and transportation infrastructure in germany just days after goebbels gave a rousing address known as the verwolf speech exhorting every man and woman to join the semi-mythical resistance network and fight to the last the allies would conquer a barren housescape of destruction and misery a misery visited upon the cowardly german people by their own ineptitude and inability to follow the glorious vision of adolf hitler speer was placed in charge of implementing the nero decree yet understandably sat on his hands as far as enacting the wholesale destruction of germany's infrastructure as an act of naked defiance that would have seen him put against a wall in previous years he would not have to endure for long the soviet drive across the odor paid increasing dividends with the soviets encircling and destroying army groups and divisions all along their offensive line and driving on berlin hitler had now well and truly separated himself from reality as the soviets closed in on berlin the remnants of army group center under command of field marshal ferdinand shomer launched an offensive intended to break through the soviet lines and reinforce the capital the fourth panzer army found some small success and hitler saw an opportunity to launch a general counter-attack ordering the repositioning of forces to link up with schoener's men and form pincers that would envelop zhukov's entire army hitler was sure the plan would work but when he unveiled this plan to his generals he was met with the reality that such a bold offensive action was impossible in a scene that has been comedically mistranslated in countless youtube videos hitler raged at his generals lamenting their cowardice and declaring the war lost these soviets encircled berlin the next day and the fight for the capital began but hitler in a final fit of vindictive madness was set upon making the communists swim to victory in their own blood the soviet forces stormed the city and brutal house to house fighting raged culminating in the storming of the reichstag on april 25th since january hitler had withdrawn underground to a complex called the furore bunker it was from here he intended to oversee the final destruction of his enemies or of germany if the soviets captured hitler the propaganda value would be enormous so his final plan was simple with cyanide and a pistol shot adolf hitler left the world he had been so keen to conquer and in which he had caused such unnecessary suffering and death the last hope of german victory had died long before but adolf hitler no doubt imagined that it in fact died with him with their furygone hordes of his followers decided that they couldn't live in a world without national socialism and ardent nazis from goebbels to even the mayor of leipzig would kill themselves and in many cases their entire families as nazi germany crumbled around them on may 7th 1945 germany surrendered the german plan to win in the final years of the second world war was entirely contingent on what was happening in the moment hitler and high command spent the end of the war in a reactionary state constantly shifting strategic priorities to ensure the completion of short-term objectives most of which failed to materialize whether it was driving for the caucasian oil fields in 1942 or raising millions of old men and boys to fight hardened allied soldiers in 1944 germany's harebrained schemes to snatch victory from a whirling maelstrom of annihilation show a dictatorial regime at the end of its rope hitler was not a military mastermind but a vain tyrant with exceptional public speaking abilities who wished to inflict his vision upon the world and when the world didn't accept his vision he sought to punish it starting with his own people [Music]

effects of this conflict altered the course of european history and set in motion events that would one day lead to the first world war ever since its foundation in the early 1700s imperial russia had sought control over the warm water ports on the black sea an area traditionally under the influence of the ottoman empire [Music] although once considered the menace of all christian europe by the 19th century the ottomans were in a rapid decline a decline which russia was eager to exploit but after the tumultuous shake-up of the napoleonic wars most other great powers of europe desperately wanted to avoid any more disruptions to the balance of power creating tension between them and the expansionist russians this tension finally boiled over in 1853 sparked by of all things a dispute over the rights of christians in the ottoman empire in an effort to project power in the middle east france declared itself the protector of all christians in the holy land and convinced the ottoman sultan abdul majid the first to issue a decree that the catholic church had sole authority over all churches holy sites and christian citizens in palestine this irritated the eastern orthodox church in russia which had previously held control over most of these churches of course neither france nor russia really cared about the religious rights of christians in palestine controlling churches meant projecting power and influence in the middle east a strategic goal of both nations the french emperor had challenged russia to a game of chicken and the ottoman empire was unlucky enough to find itself right in the middle of it not one to back down the russian tsar nicholas the first promptly sent an ambassador to the ottomans in hope of changing the sultan's mind this effort succeeded and the sultan promptly restored authority over the churches to the orthodox church in russia expectedly the highly ambitious french emperor napoleon iii escalated the situation by sending a warship into the black sea as a show of force which prompted abdul majid to flip-flop once again and proclaim his eternal respect for the authority of the catholic church further negotiations proved fruitless with the british ambassador to the ottoman empire stepping in to support the sultan against russian retaliation neither side was willing to back down and so in may of 1853 two russian armies crossed the pruitt river and invaded the balkan provinces of the ottoman empire left with no other choice the ottomans declared war in response and sent forces to check the russian advance at the danube river arriving in september the ottoman empire quickly moved to establish strongholds along the danube under the leadership of the skilled general omar pasha the first battle of the war took place in early november when the ottomans crossed the river and recaptured the occupied town of altenitsa in modern day romania the russians launched a counter-attack to reclaim the town resulting in a bloody and indecisive battle which ended with both sides withdrawing to their previous positions fighting in the balkans would continue in much the same way for the rest of 1853 with neither side managing to gain a decisive advantage tsar nicholas was hoping for an announcement of support from austria his long-term ally in order to break this stalemate but the austrians were reluctant to get involved instead they hoped to settle things with the mighty pen and hosted a conference in vienna with representatives from france britain and prussia with the goal of drafting a treaty to end the war while these talks were ongoing russian warships chanced upon an ottoman fleet near the port of cena hoping to disrupt their enemy's supply lines the russian ships opened fire initiating battle this engagement saw the first ever use of explosive shells in naval combat which completely devastated the wooden holes of the ottoman ships inflicting over 3 000 casualties and destroying their entire fleet the events at cnop alarmed the other great powers and the representatives at vienna quickly finalized a proposed peace treaty which they presented to sultan abdul majit and tsar nicholas in december nicholas was willing to accept the terms offered but the sultan objected and diplomatic talks soon completely broke down fighting continued and in february of 1854 britain and france presented an ultimatum to russia withdraw from the balkans or they would join the war but now russia refused to back down and the british and french declared their own war in march of 1854 having made no further gains and fearing the intervention of a dubiously neutral austria nicholas ordered his forces to withdraw from the balkan provinces in july russia at this time was one of austria's most important allies and so by not supporting the russians they found themselves isolated diplomatically all throughout the 19th century with hostilities temporarily ceased the war could have ended there but britain and france spurred on by pro-war public opinion and eager to put an end to further russian expansion chose to continue the fighting launching a full invasion of the crimean peninsula seizing this peninsula would russia's naval power in the black sea greatly reducing their influence in the middle east and balkans the allied forces landed at a beach north of the city of sevastopol in september and their troubles began almost immediately the landing of the invasion force was badly mismanaged for starters there was no equipment for the unloading of cargo forcing the soldiers to steal carts and wagons from nearby tartar farms during this piecemeal unloading process the soldiers were forced to sleep outside in the rain and heat due to the lack of tents and camping supplies to make matters even worse there was not enough food or water to go around nor enough medicine to treat the many men who came down with cholera and other diseases after four days the invasion force finally overcame this comedy of errors and set out for sevastopol on the first day of their march the allied forces got their first glimpse of the russian army assembled on a hill on the other side of the alma river the next morning they crossed the river and attacked the russians beginning the battle of alma the defenders were outnumbered with 37 500 men standing against the 56 500 strong invasion force but the russians held a strong defensive position on a steep hill they held out against three hours of repeated assaults by the ottomans british and french before withdrawing however the allied forces were unable to pursue them due to their lack of cavalry following the battle the invading army marched southeast to the coast encircling sebastopol and establishing temporary ports at the towns of balaclava and kamish to bring in supplies in october they began to besiege the city with cannon brought in by sea although further widespread outbreaks of cholera weakened the british army emboldening the defenders to launch several probing attacks on october 25th the russians attempted a large-scale assault on the british position at balaclava sending 25 000 men to disrupt the allies supply chain between their ports and these siege lines the first line of defenses at the verontov heights manned by the ottomans was quickly overwhelmed and the russian cavalry then swept down the hill toward the second defensive line in a valley to the south there a combined force of ottoman and british infantry managed to hold the line against the enemy cavalry charge in a defense that would come to be known as the thin red line on the northern side of the hill the british cavalry's light brigade was sent to intercept russian forces attempting to withdraw after seizing ottoman artillery guns captured on the heights but this order relayed verbally through multiple sources in something like a game of telephone was ultimately misinterpreted by the light brigades commanders who sent the light cavalry charging down the valley straight into the teeth of a dug in russian artillery regiment the resulting charge of the light brigade was a complete failure and left over a third of the brigade soldiers killed wounded or captured and over a half of its horses dead shortly thereafter the russian forces pulled back to their newly captured defensive positions at the varanza of heights and the battle came to an end while the siege of sevastopol would continue the russians had won a tactical and morale boosting victory at balaklava in large part thanks to the disorganization of their enemies this disorganization and incompetence at the command level would continue to plague the allied forces for the rest of the war preventing them from gaining significant ground after the inconclusive battle of balaklava russian strategists believed that their enemy's supply lines were overextended and vulnerable to attack on november 5th the russians gathered a force of 42 000 men to assault the british near the village of inckerman with the goal of breaking through their defenses before reinforcements could arrive advancing in the early hours of the morning the attackers were hidden by a thick fog as they approached the british defenses at a hill called home ridge the french and british defenders on and around homebridge numbered only around 13 000 less than a third of the size of the russian army bearing down on them fighting began at dawn when the russian general fedor soimanov sent around 15 000 men to assault the ridge which in the early stages of battle was defended by just 2 700 men of the british second division however british forward defenses in the valley did catch sight of the russians advancing through the fog and opened fire alerting the men of the second division to attack but due to this fog the defenders on holmridge had no idea how outnumbered they truly were emboldened by their ignorance the acting commander of the second division major general john pennyfeather ordered the entire force to advance down the hill and meet the russians head on the russians attempted to soften up the defenders by bombarding homridge with artillery however they didn't realize that the second division was no longer on the hill they didn't become aware of the impending counter-attack until the british soldiers emerged from the fog right in front of them and fighting began almost immediately the russians attempted to break through on the second division's left flank but were pushed back their outdated flintlock muskets completely outmatched by the british enfield percussion lock rifles in the fighting that followed soymentoff the russian general was killed and swiftly replaced by another officer who was then promptly shot and killed too followed by a third commander who survived for a few minutes and then was killed too at this point the remaining russian officers were understandably reluctant to take charge and so promptly withdrew to regroup as british reinforcements poured in once a second column of russian troops arrived in assistance the tsar's men shifted their focus to the northeast where the british had set up a defensive wall called the barrier fifteen thousand men advanced on the barrier which was being held by only 300 troops channeling their inner spartans these 300 men fixed bayonets and vaulted over the wall to charge at the russian army with the fog still hampering visibility on both sides the bayonet charge caused enough confusion among the russians to halt their advance giving enough time for reinforcements to arrive and attack the russians flank forcing them to withdraw still not knowing exactly what was going on the imperial russian army gathered up for one final push on home ridge the fighting was fierce and hectic with the dense haze forcing many units on both sides to act completely on their own initiative cut off from their allies which would eventually earn the battle of inckerman the nickname the soldier's battle just as the british defenders began to falter the timely arrival of french reinforcements allowed them to hold back the russians and ultimately drive them away from home ridge bringing the battle to an end at the end of the day approximately one-third of the allied and russian soldiers fighting in the battle had been killed wounded or captured the demoralized survivors retreated back behind the walls of sevastopol and the allied forces dug in for a long siege the bitter cold of the ensuing winter coupled with severe supply shortages among the procedures soon led to a halt in ground operations a massive storm in late november destroyed 30 allied transport ships many carrying crucial winter clothing and other supplies which led to thousands of deaths of hypothermia and disease the russians made one more attempt to break out of the siege in february of 1855 attacking an ottoman base at the town of eupatoria north of sevastopol heavy artillery from the ottomans well-fortified positions forced the russians back and the attack was called off after just three hours of fighting the assault on eupatoria was the last major russian effort to break the siege but the miserable struggle for sevastopol was far from over in march british contractors completed the construction of the grand crimean central railway a rail line built to quickly bring ammunition and supplies from the ships to the siege lines the railway allowed the allies to intensify their bombardments of the city but it did little to stave off the waves of disease running rampant through their camps killing tens of thousands the flagging morale of the allied forces was bolstered somewhat by the arrival of 18 000 fresh troops from the kingdom of sardinia whose king hoped to strengthen his alliance with france the sardinian troops provided welcome support but even so when sevastopol finally fell on september 9th both sides were utterly exhausted and no further operations were conducted in crimea before the next winter arrived further east the russians and ottomans continued battering against each other in the caucasus where small and inconclusive engagements had been fought throughout the war while a handful of towns and forts in the region changed hands neither side was able to make any decisive gains on that front this trend was reflected across many other fronts with inconclusive skirmishes taking place in the azov sea the baltic and even russia's pacific coast by late 1855 after years of bloody and pointless fighting both sides were thoroughly sick of the war [Applause] the british public especially fed up with reports of fiascos like the charge of the light brigade and the staggering death toll from disease during the siege of sevastopol began to demand an immediate end to the conflict new technologies like the telegram and photography were making the truth about the horrors of war more accessible to the average citizen than ever before contributing to an unprecedented public outcry although the new british prime minister lord palmerston had great ambitions of expanding the war and permanently crippling the russian empire pressure from the public and his french allies eventually forced him to agree to peace talks on the russian side the new czar alexander ii felt pressured to make peace after austria prussia and sweden began showing signs that they might be willing to join the war on the allies side thus on march 30 1856 the treaty of paris was signed and brought the crimean war to an end the treaty essentially amounted to a status quo restoring orthodox control of the churches in palestine forcing russia and the ottomans to return to each other's captured territories and banning any nation from maintaining warships or fortified ports in the black sea this clause of the treaty was later ignored by the russians in 1871 after the fall of napoleon iii in france caused the french to lose interest in eastern geopolitics six years later in 1877 the russian empire attacked the ottomans again this time claiming territory in the caucasus and securing the independence of bulgaria and other balkan states without much outside interference as russia simply went back and took what it had been after in the first place many in europe were left wondering what the point of the crimean war had been ultimately the only tangible outcome of the crimean war was a tremendous loss of life on both sides around 165 000 of all allied troops died and almost 120 000 of those died of disease the russians lost 130 000 89 000 of which were to disease in britain the public was outraged by the strategic and logistical failures at all levels of command during the war and widespread calls began for sweeping reforms of the army and greater professionalism in the medical field in particular the demands for army reforms were ultimately blocked but the push for medical reform spurred on by the famous battlefield nurses florence nightingale and mary c cole were much more successful leading to the development of professional nursing in britain and improving health care for all british society in russia the embarrassment of defeat prompted a major push for modernization across all sectors of society in order to catch up with the rest of europe the wave of reforms in the years following the crimean war included the abolishment of serfdom expansion of rail and telegraph networks modernization of medicine and the reorganization and modernization of the army the crimean war exposed some of the most devastating flaws of the established ways of waging war in europe prompting major efforts to modernize on both sides this push towards technological dominance contributed to the rise of nationalism in russia an ideology which would profoundly impact the nation's foreign policy for the rest of the 19th century further russian interference in the balkans would later give rise to nationalist sentiments in that volatile region escalating tensions that would eventually boil over into the assassination of an austrian prince in 1914 in many ways the crimean war was the first small domino in the chain leading up to the world wars you\",\n",

under robert e lee was marching north into the state of pennsylvania after a series of major victories against the union general lee believed that if he could menace washington dc and other northern cities he could compel his enemies to sue for peace lee's army of northern virginia was seventy thousand men strong and standing against him was the army of the potomac under the command of major general george mead with a total strength of over 93 000 men the union army had been following lee north ever since their disastrous defeat at chancellorsville and while several skirmishes had been fought a full-scale engagement would not occur until july 1st when confederate and union troops chanced on each other just outside the town of gettysburg as the army of northern virginia advances through pennsylvania on june 30th a ford brigade of ap hills third corps encounters some union cavalry while marching to gettysburg to secure supplies the brigade marches back to cashtown to report the federal cavalry in gettysburg when this is reported to henry heath one of ap hill's divisional commanders he doesn't believe this report heath convinces ap hill the commander of the third corps to send two of his divisions to gettysburg to determine the size of the union force in the area hill assumes that the cavalry that has been spotted is just a small unit of pennsylvania militia and he expects that if necessary his men can easily sweep them from the field and seize the supplies at their leisure what none of the confederates know is that the union cavalrymen are not militia they're with the army of the potomac which is not far behind when hill's men arrived the next day the horsemen hold their ground and engage the enemy immediately sending a call for reinforcements the battle of gettysburg begins elements of the union first corps arrive as reinforcements general john f reynolds commander of the first corps quickly takes control of the situation personally leading the wanted iron brigade into mcpherson's woods until he is struck and killed by a stray bullet with one of their highest ranking officers dead union forces struggle to hold the line by early afternoon the 11th corps arrives to bolster the defense but the confederates numbers begin to grow as well the federals persevere against extreme pressure from the west and northwest but two fresh confederate divisions move in from the northern side in concert with renewed pressure on the union's west by now 17 confederate brigades with a strength of almost 27 000 men bear down on around 22 000 federal troops these men are widely spread out however and the 11th corps is stretched too thin across the northern front their vulnerable position is completely overwhelmed by mid-afternoon and the collapse of the entire union line soon follows the federals are forced to flee through the streets of gettysburg with the rebels hot on their heels some union troops stage a fighting retreat withdrawing in contact and taking heavy casualties as their comrades scattered through the town despite having the union on the run general richard ewell and general a p hill order their men to halt their pursuit north of gettysburg pausing to wait for reinforcements while their enemy hunkers down among the defensive terrain south of the town robber e lee had instructed yule to take the heights in the south only if practicable and yule evidently does not think his men capable of routing the federal troops out of the hills at this time as the sun begins to lower in the sky both sides settle into their respective positions awaiting reinforcements and preparing for the much fiercer fighting to come the first day of the battle of gettysburg had fewer men engaged and fewer lives lost than the grisly days that followed but it still saw over 15 000 casualties between the two sides while the union was eventually forced to retreat they bloodied the confederate force enough that yule was unwilling to pursue them to the south historians continue to speculate about what would have happened had yule attempted to seize the heights that day but as it stands the federal troops were allowed to fortify the heights they would hold for the next two days of brutal fighting [Music] as the sun rises on july 2nd the army of the potomac is digging in south of gettysburg they have utilized the elevated terrain of cemetery hill and cemetery ridge to form a strong compact defensive line consisting of the bulk of their forces while others establish positions at corpse hill to secure their right and left flanks respectively by mid-morning the bulk of both armies have arrived including six of seven union cores this brings their effective strength to around 69 000 men deployed into an extended line shaped like a fishhook the terrain they occupy is perfect for defense presenting a tough obstacle for general lee and his 57 000 troops the venerated virginian considers the state of the battlefield before deciding on a plan while his forces in the north under general yule stage a small diversionary attack to lock down the enemy's right flank the main attack will smash against the lower end of the union left lee hopes to circumvent the tough defenses on cemetery ridge and push through to attack the union rear cutting off their lines of supply and communication before crushing the army of the potomac decisively but while lee assembles his forces the union suffers a near fatal setback before the fighting even begins general daniel sickles commander of the third corps and very devoted husband has deployed his men in a compact line from the edge of cemetery ridge to little round top as per mead's orders but sickles notices that about a half mile or 0.8 kilometers ahead of him lies a peach orchard which is elevated slightly above his position deciding he must have the high ground sickles orders his core forward to occupy the peach orchard turning his section of the line into a vulnerable salient exposed to attack on three sides worse lee's main assault is coming right in that direction at 4 pm yule's artillery begins shelling pope's hill and confederate forces under general james longstreet descend on the union's lower flank sickle's over-extended third corps is engaged by the confederate first corps in three places the wheat field the peach orchard and devil's den the rocky hill of devil's den is hit first with two rebel brigades charging through the woods to attack the defenders head on with little time to build defenses the federals have no option but to stand firm against the reign of monae balls and bayonets control of the hill shifts back and forth in a series of attacks and counter-attacks again and again and again a little further south the alabama brigade part of general john bel hood's division advances on little round top expecting an easier time the hill is almost completely undefended and once they seize it they'll be able to threaten the enemy flank but as the rebels advance a union brigade from the fifth corps under colonel strong vincent rushes to occupy the hill vincent arrives just in time coming under fire immediately from confederate artillery and hastily assembles his men around the steep hills summit stretched thin to avoid being flanked the brave defenders on the left side of the hill barely managed to hold on to the line as the alabamians charge withdraw and charge again even as the bodies of their comrades begin to litter the woods around them pushing back the second charge leaves the union soldiers exhausted and low on ammunition the odds of repelling another attack are slim with this in mind colonel joshua chamberlain commander of the 20th main occupying the extreme left flank decides that the best defense is a seemingly suicidal offense and orders his men to fix bayonets and charge down the slope the mainers crash into the demoralized rebels and their bold gambit pays off the alabamians turn and flee securing the left flank [Music] the right side of little round top is still under threat however with the texas brigade pressing hard against the badly outnumbered defenders strong vincent is mortally wounded and the tide seems to be turning against the union until more union reinforcements arrive and launch another bold counter-attack sending the texans running little round top is secured but the union troops at devil's den are forced to withdraw after an intense battle the fighting shifts to the north where troops in the wheat field and the peach orchard are engaged in some of the bloodiest combat of the battle huddled behind a low stone wall atop a hill west of the wheat field a single regiment of maine volunteers fires volley after volley into the rebels rushing toward them holding fast even as their comrades withdraw they stage an admirable defense but their commander general james barnes controversially orders them to withdraw abandoning the valuable hill to the confederates meanwhile to the north kershaw's brigade of south carolinians on route to the wheat field turn and charge the right flank of the union troops defending the peach orchard confusion among the ranks causes the south carolinians to turn away and expose their flanks to the defenders and they suffer massive losses as a result but as the eager union forces turn to fire on their fleeing foes they expose themselves to a crushing assault from the north which quickly collapses their line and leaves the peach orchard in the hands of the confederacy back in the wheat field reinforcements from the union second corps have arrived to retake the positions abandoned by barnes but before they can consolidate their gains rebel troops charge from the captured peach orchard and seize the field once again even more federals reinforce south of the wheat field but the confederates in devil's den flank the two approaching brigades forcing them to withdraw to little round top the rebels can finally advance through the field unopposed but they are exhausted and low on ammunition when they reach the eastern end of the wheat field a final counter-attack breaks their faltering morale and sends them fleeing leaving the blood-soaked plot of land in control of the union the fierce fighting leaves many casualties including most unfortunately general sickles right leg which was hit by a cannonball but the fighting is not over at 6 pm hill orders general richard anderson's division to assault the federal center on cemetery ridge which is now dangerously thin after so many troops were diverted to shore up sickles salient at one point the confederates reach the ridge but general winfield s hancock commander of the union second corps is able to muster enough men to repel the attack as the sun begins to set general ewell finally escalates his diversionary bombardments into a full-scale attack on the union right flank three brigades are sent charging up corpse hill while two more climb the east side of cemetery hill for the defenders holding copes hill is just as essential as little round top if not more the baltimore pike the primary union supply line lies just behind it not to mention the unprotected flanks of their comrades on cemetery hill the loss of corpse hill would be catastrophic but at the moment there is only one brigade defending it under the command of general george greene green's men have spent most of the day constructing fortifications on corpse hill alongside his comrades in the 12th chord but mead had ordered the rest of the corps to shore up the left side of the line a few hours ago leaving green and his 1400 men to hold the hill alone outnumbered though they are the federal troops are fighting from a series of sturdy fortifications assembled earlier in the day and these strong positions allow them to repel the vastly superior confederate force after three hours of fighting but as the rebels retreat they hold the fortifications on lower corpse hill that were left abandoned when one of green's regiments withdrew and managed to dig in there hill's attack on cemetery hill is soundly defeated but the rebels have gained a small foothold on corpse hill as night falls and the fighting ends despite massive losses the union line is still intact after a long day of brutal bloody combat the union defenders held firm the cost of their success was the almost total destruction of the third corps and a total of ten thousand casualties the most tragic of course was general sickles right leg the confederates only lost around seven thousand men but robert e lee's hope of crushing the army of the potomac was dashed as night fell both sides licked their wounds and prepared for what would be the final bloody day of the battle going into july 3rd the positions of both sides are more or less the same as they were the day before so robert e lee's strategy is mostly the same attack the weakened left flank while yule's men keep pushing on corpse hill but before he is able to execute his plan the confederates are rudely interrupted at the crack of dawn by a union artillery barrage followed by an infantry assault after a seven hour struggle for corpse hill the longest sustained fighting of the battle the union reclaims their former positions the defender's line is now not only restored but stronger than it was the day before lee is forced to reconsider his approach and he settles on a bold plan he assembles nine infantry brigades from three different divisions totaling over 12 500 men and prepares to charge straight into the enemy's center held by hancock's second quarter meanwhile lee dispatches general jeb steward's cavalry division which arrived the previous night to circle around the battlefield to attack the union rear from the east but a union cavalry division led by general david gregg is on hand to block their approach and the two begin to skirmish while the horsemen battle to the east lee attempts to soften the defenders by ordering every gun he has to fire on cemetery ridge with over 150 cannon firing met by about 80 union guns in a counter barrage this is the largest artillery bombardment of the civil war and among the loudest man-made noises in history up to that point while the cannon roar chaos unfolds in the east as the cavalry battle escalates from skirmishes to full-blown charges and counter-charges from both sides the mounted soldiers hack and blast each other apart at point-blank range neither side gaining the advantage after 40 minutes of intense fighting stewart's division is forced to withdraw foiling lee's plan to attack the union rear with cavalry soon after the guns fall silent as the army of northern virginia's ammunition stores run dry and at 2pm general james longstreet hesitantly orders the assault force to march 4th and take cemetery ridge batteries on cemetery hill and little round top open up with withering fire as they advance devastating the confederates as they struggle to cross the three quarters of a mile between them and the ridgeline the second corps then opens up with their own artillery batteries carving bloody swathes out of the approaching mass of rebel troops but the haggard soldiers are still coming and as they close within a few hundred yards of their enemy they break from their steady march into a full-blown charge rushing the enemy positions and filling the air with a cacophony of their infamous rebel yell the federal troops take the charge and hold firm but in the middle of the line at a curved stone wall known as the angle the defenders wavered and for a moment the line breaks the rebels managed to seize two union cannon and turn them on the rest of the line but find that there are no rounds left to fire union reinforcements pour into the breach and the rebels are forced back as they lose momentum the confederacy's bold charge ends with a disorderly retreat and barely half of longstreet's force makes it back to their lines intact his last gambit has failed and lee now desperately marshals his remaining force to defend against a union counter-attack but the army of the potomac is nearly as broken and exhausted as his and no offensive comes an uneasy quiet settles over the battlefield and the day comes to an end in the morning the army of northern virginia begins to slink away its supplies and wounded are loaded into a wagon train which flees northwest before making its way south through the cumberland valley the rest of the army retreats to the southwest harried by cavalry but without the bulk of the union army in pursuit eventually lee reaches safety in virginia and the gettysburg campaign comes to an end on the same day that the confederates withdrew from gettysburg the garrison of the fortress at vicksburg which commanded the mississippi river surrendered to ulysses s grant the tide of the war had turned and the confederacy would never seriously threaten the north again in the end the battle of gettysburg left nearly a third of all troops engaged either killed or wounded and it would go down in history as the deadliest battle of the civil war and as for the greatest casualty of the battle of gettysburg and some say the entire american civil war general dan sickle's leg would be proudly displayed in the army medical museum and its former owner would sometimes visit his erstwhile limb but most importantly abraham lincoln would visit the battlefield the following november to deliver his gettysburg address vowing to reunite the nation and affirming his belief as president that all men are created equal [Music] thanks again to war and peace civil war for sponsoring this video do your part in either the union or confederate armies today by

       " \" hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian few nations embraced the invention of the tank with as much vigor as the soviet union building on the experiments performed by the russian empire in the closing days of the first world war the soviet union constantly sought to improve its armored capabilities fielding some of the most well-known tanks in military history throughout the second world war with the war's end these soviets only increased their research and development preparing for a possible conflict with their ideological enemies and equipping their enhanced tanks with the latest armor and personnel protection technology this spirit of armored innovation continues in the present day with the russian federation continuing to build on the works of the red army in this

soviet and modern russian tank production and development is truly dizzying so we will just be examining the key turning points in each tank design both for the sake of brevity and preventing our animators from launching a worker's revolution of their own additionally we'll be focusing on tanks exclusively and will not be covering small armored vehicles tank destroyers or self-propelled guns with that said let's begin like her continental peers the russian empire began experimenting with armored warfare during the first world war in august of 1914 designer alexander perak hofshikov was tasked with creating an all-terrain vehicle for the tsar's army the result of his labors was the vesticot literally translating as all-terrain vehicle with a repeated top speed of 42.6 kilometers per hour and iron armor plating the vesticot is the first of a handful of russian tanks that are poorly understood little information survives about this tsarist experiment the vesticot project was carried out in spurts between 1914 and 1916 ultimately ending in the october of that year with the fall of the russian empire and the rise of the soviet union international trade disputes resulted in american weapons designer walter j christie inking a deal to sell his design for a fast tank to the red army the first of these american tanks were built and shipped to the soviet union as agricultural tractors to skirt an arms embargo imposed upon the communist state thanks to its christie's suspension system the b-2 had incredible mobility and a simple field modification allowed the fragile tracks to be removed letting the wheels run directly on paved surfaces enabling top speeds of up to 55 kilometers or 34 miles per hour four years after the b2's adoption the red army slowly replaced it with the bt-7 which remained in service until the end of the second world war the bt-7 could reach a top speed of 86 kilometers or 53 miles per hour on road and 50 kilometers or 31 miles per hour off-road the bt-20 light tank was introduced in 1938 as a pre-production model for the t-34 two main variants were produced the bt-20 or a20 and the a-32 or t-32 the a-20 mounted a 45-millimeter main gun and weighed in at 31 tons the variant also featured sloped armor and a larger simplified hole to aid in protection and manufacturing respectively the a32 added two more wheels on each track and widened the tracks themselves full armor was thickened across the board and the caliber of the main gun was upgraded to a 76.2 millimeter l10 the a32 was a limited production model similar to its successor the a32 served as the basis for the t-34 laying the foundation for one of the most effective tanks in military history which made its debut following the outbreak of the second world war variants of the t-34 would serve across the globe in conflicts ranging from world war ii to korea there were many variants produced but here are the most notable the basic model 1940 t-34 saw action from 1940 to 1944 and carried a crew of four with an l-11 76.2 millimeter main gun like the t-32 that preceded it weighing in at 26.8 tons and with between 16 and 52 millimeters of armor thickness the t-34 could reach a top speed of 54 kilometers per hour or 33.5 miles per hour as it pushed back the tide of nazi aggression the 1943 t-34 dubbed the t-3485 saw increases across the board adding an additional crew member and bringing armor thickness in selective areas up to 80 millimeters this extra protection led to a sharp increase in weight at 32 tons but reduced speeds of 38 kilometers or 23 miles per hour the 1943 model also increased the size of the main gun bringing the caliber up to 85 millimeters in 1945 the t-3485 was outfitted with an electrically driven traverse motor for the turret greatly enhancing its ability to engage moving targets in a chaotic battlefield environment over 57 600 of these motorized turret tanks would be built before the war's end the final t-34 variant added night driving gear and an enlarged fuel tank to bring the war-weary platform into the modern age the t-44 tank was brought into service beginning in 1944 while originally intended to build on the t-34 the final product ended up being a complete redesign weighing in at 31 tons and with four crew members the tank featured an impressive 120 millimeter maximum armor thickness a total of 1823 tanks were built from 1944 but none saw service during the second world war 1961 saw the t-44m roll off of the assembly line the first in a long line of retrofitted tanks with the letter m designated for modernized the t-44m was refitted with increased ammunition and fuel capacity as well as night vision and infrared sights enabling it to fight in any situation the t-54 succeeded the t-44 going on to become the most widely used tank throughout the eastern bloc over 35 000 were built and modernizations and adaptations kept the model in regular use through the 1990s and possibly even into the 2020s the t-54 shared a similar armor layout as its predecessor but now utilized a torsion bar suspension system with redesigned treads an articulated gun sight and anti-aircraft machine gun were additional features added to the base design over time in 1954 the red army used the t54 platform to test the d54ts 100 millimeter main gun paired with a reduga stabilizer this modernization project the t-54m would serve as a blueprint for future t54 designs as models began integrating separate stabilization systems and also began being identified with alphabetic suffixes in 1957 the t-54b took the field armed with a new rifled gun and a second generation stp stabilizer while improved survivability was provided by standardized self-sealing fuel tanks 1959 saw the addition of infrared optics an infrared searchlight was mounted on the commander's cupola and the gunner was given an ir sight to allow target acquisition in any level of light the t-55 tank built on many of the innovations of the t-54 with a new focus on protection and survivability in all manner of combat conditions the base t-55 was a formidable fighting vehicle with a plethora of improvements over the t-54 such as an improved engine and a full complement of nuclear biological and chemical safeguards inspired by nuclear blast tests performed on the t-54 over 27 500 units were produced over the course of the model service life during the 1970s and 80s the t-55 underwent a veritable maelstrom of improvements under the model names t-55m and t-55am the tank was outfitted with increased armor and anti-mine defenses an upgraded engine new tracks and suspension a laser range finder fitted onto the main gun 81 millimeter smoke grenade launchers for concealment and many other improvements a notable sub variant was the t-55 modified for service in afghanistan which was given soft side skirts over its tracks and a rear rpg screen to counter the conditions of the soviets battle against the taliban and other militants the 1990s saw a revolution in tank defense with the introduction of explosive reactive armor where a layer of explosive material is sandwiched between the sheets of armor plating when struck by a shell or any projectile the sandwiched explosive will detonate ideally destroying the shell before it can penetrate the armor and kill the crew inside the t-55 received its first outfitting of era with the t-55 mv and the amv which were initially adopted by the soviet naval infantry before spreading to its newly formed ground forces of the russian federation following the soviet union's collapse introduced in tandem with the t-55 was the 1961's t-62 of which 22 700 were built created as an answer to the british centurion and american patent tanks the t-62 had a 115 millimeter smoothbore cannon firing new kinetic energy penetrator rounds with a 102 millimeter frontal plate angled at a 60 degree angle and a turret up to 214 millimeters thick in some places the t-62 had excellent armor for its day it was eventually modernized as the t-62m equipped with a volna rangefinder improved sights and a ballistic computer 10 millimeters of armor was added to the tank's side skirts and improved nbc protection completed the overhaul 1963 saw the introduction of the t-64 platform 12 000 of the base tanks were built notable for their sharp increase in armor thickness a maximum of 599 millimeters and the reduction of crew from the standard four to three the first refresh for the t64 came in 1966 with the introduction of the t64a the main gun was scaled up to 125 millimeters from an initial caliber of 115 millimeters with a new rangefinder and sights additionally a new turret was introduced for the commander as well as an anti-aircraft gun intended as the second generation main battle tank for the soviet armed forces this 41 and a half ton behemoth was armed with a 125 millimeter main gun as well as a 12.7 millimeter anti-aircraft machine gun and a coaxial 7.62 machine gun for anti-infantry duties the ba variant of the t72 added era in the form of contact 1 composite plates arrayed along the turret and hole the t-72 would go on to receive upgrades to its contact armor throughout its useful life up until the modern day t72 b3 introduced thermal sighting for improved target acquisition in all manner of conditions first produced in 2014 the t72 b3 can still be found in russian armored units today introduced in 1976 the t-80a was an amalgam of new parts and components from the t-72 and the t-64 the driver's position shifted to the center of the crew compartment with the other two crew positioned inside a new two-man turret era and nbc protection came standard and over 5000 t-80as were produced t-adu short for ulucenya or improved sported the contact 5 era system as well as an improved engine leading to increased survivability range and service life the t90 tank was introduced as the third generation main battle tank for the nascent russian federation 2260 of these 45.7 ton tanks were built mounting a 125 millimeter main gun along anti-tank missile capability the russian government has released little other information about the t90 which continues to serve to this day the latest model the t90am features a smoothbore 2a46m5 gun as well as upgrades to its armor and engine our last medium tank was introduced in 2015 the t14 armada is the cutting edge of russian mbt design 900 millimeters of armor protects its crew of three who operate a 2a82 smoothbore gun and 12.7 millimeter cord machine gun and 7.62 millimeter purpose-built tank machine gun the turret is entirely mechanized which eliminates the positions of the gunner and loader traditionally found in tank crews production for the model was planned to reach 2300 between 2015 to 2020 with a test batch of 100 to be issued to the second guard's motor rifle division in 2021 the first of russia's heavy tank designs the t28 featured a crew of five and later six men operating a 76 76.2 millimeter howitzer and between three to five 7.62 millimeter machine guns a rolling gun position the t28 was protected by 20 to 30 millimeters of overall armor thickness 503 units were produced between 1932 and 1941. a sterling example of the short-lived trend of outfitting massive tanks with multiple turrets the t-35 could be best described as a land battleship with a total of five gun turrets covering massive arcs of fire more of a propaganda tool than a weapon of war t-35 units rumbled into action during operation barbarossa only to promptly break down on mass and be scuttled by their crews to prevent capture by the germans the kv heavy tank first debuted in 1939. the base tank had a production run of 100 units each armed with a 76 millimeter cannon and five crew 25 to 90 millimeter of armor made the tank an extremely tough nut to crack the second generation kv-1b introduced in 1940 added an additional machine gun as well as an improved cannon the 1b was a simplified design intended for mass production and 1200 were built now behold the russian death fridge introduced in 1940 the kv-2 proved more than effective against the vermost during the defense of the soviet union topping out at 57 and a half tons and mounting a 152 millimeter howitzer as its main gun this six-man juggernaut helped stopped the german invasion cold first introduced in 1943 the is series of heavy tanks served as a test bed for the latest in soviet and later russian design philosophy eventually leading to the modern t10 system the is-1 was based on the kv-85 and sought to address the mobility and armament problems the kv line had developed while taking advantage of the armor trade-offs and design choices made in the previous series at 43 tons and with a crew of four the is-1 mounted an 85 millimeter main gun complemented by three 7.62 machine guns 120 millimeters of frontal armor protected the hull and turret introduced later in 1943 the is-2 was designed specifically to counter german heavy tanks with 3854 of these purpose-built cat killers rolling off of the assembly line a 122 millimeter main gun promised to deal heavy damage to nazi armor and a dishca anti-aircraft machine gun warded off any luftwaffe attackers just a year after the introduction of the is-2 came the is-3 first unveiled during the allied victory parade in berlin the is-3 had an all-new armor layout and a distinctive pike nose turret that offered excellent protection introduced in 1952 the penultimate version of the soviet's heavy tank platform began its life as the is-9 later re-christened the is-10 and then the t-10 in 1953 as part of the destalinization program of nikita khrushchev over 5000 of these tanks were built featuring a 122 millimeter main gun and two 12.7 millimeter machine guns as well as 250 millimeters of armor at its thickest the final version of the soviets heavy tank program the t10m was completed in 1957. modernizations included replacing one machine gun with a 14.5 millimeter cannon as well as integrating night vision optics and nbc protection in the platform a longer hole and turret accommodated a larger gun with an integral muzzle break the net result was a massive vehicle that was ultimately abandoned in favor for other tank designs [Music] [Music] [Music]

morale shattering the myth of the vermont's invincibility with axis forces exhausted and overstretched the red army seized the initiative launching a counter-offensive known as operation little saturn the soviets succeeded in driving their foes into the danietz basin liberating kursk on the 8th of february and the major city of kharkiff on the 18th with the soviets on the march and the western allies set to land in italy the fuhrer realized that time was against him if the situation was to be salvaged a decisive victory was needed on the eastern front hitler gave field marshal eric von manstein the authority to counter-attack by the 15th of march manchester's army group south had retaken kharkiv and created a 250 kilometer or 155 mile wide salient in the soviet line centered on the city of kursk suddenly the wehrmacht had the opportunity to launch an attack onto the bulge destroying a significant portion of the soviet forces there and preventing further counter-attacks the finalized plan codenamed untenement zitidella or operation citadel was set to launch on july 5th it called for two simultaneous armored thrusts to break through the red army's defenses and envelop the salient at the city of kursk however soviet high command anticipated the german plans and had to raid a massive defense manned by the twelve armies of the central and varanesh fronts as well as the newly formed step front not only did german assault formations lack the element of surprise they were also greatly outnumbered and worse still the offensive lacked the desired fire support to break through the deeply entrenched soviet positions the vermost had suffered tremendous artillery losses at stalingrad as such german commanders decided to rely on the luftwaffe as flying artillery to supplement the offensive's firepower the first fleeger division and the eighth fleeger corps were responsible for this task the former had around 640 operational planes at its disposal to support the northern advance but the majority of these were ground attack aircraft as fighters were desperately needed to protect the german homeland from allied bombing raids in fact its two fighter wings consisted of only one hundred and forty five fakavolf 190s meanwhile the eighth flier core had a similar makeup of 730 planes with four fighter groups consisting of 120 messerschmitt bf-109s this brought their total operational strength to approximately 1 370 aircraft on the eve of operation citadel with this combined force the luftwaffe promised they would be able to achieve a breakthrough after just two days of fighting the soviets on their part could rely on double the amount of air support in the north the 16th air army would cover the central front with some 1030 operational planes backing it up was the neighboring 15th air army of the briansk front adding an additional 1000 planes to the fray and in the south the situation was identical here the second air army equal in size to the 16th would be supported by the adjacent 17th air army in support of the varanyash front finally both sectors could count on the supplementary support of the independent long-range aviation as well as from the local air defense of kursk if these overwhelming numbers did not already put the attackers at a serious disadvantage late on july 4 a captured german engineer broke under interrogation revealing the exact time and place the offensive was to start with this knowledge in hand soviet leadership was now in an unprecedented position to seriously bloody the german assault before it even had a chance to begin in the morning of july 5th around 100 il-2 stermovics and 200 fighter escorts launched a pre-emptive attack on five nearby german airstrips around kharkiv to stop the grounded luftwaffe from supporting the opening offensive unfortunately for the soviets the element of surprise was lost quickly as the soviet formations were picked up by german radar and numerous fighters were redirected to intercept the unsuspecting soviet formations what followed was nothing less than a massacre shortly before 3 30 am the fighters made first contact the less experienced soviet pilots proved no match for their german counterparts soviet pilots were shocked to see messerschmitts raining down on them like steely hale breaking through the fighter escort and picking off the vulnerable stermovics with impunity what planes managed to survive this onslaught were then greeted with heavy flak fire from the airfields a luftwaffe surgeon stationed on one of these airstrips noted that the soviet planes had tumbled from the sky like dead flies i doubt that a single machine made it back home according to german reports this bloody opening act cost the soviet air force 50 aircraft in return the attack group had failed to destroy even a single grounded plane the curtain fell on a crushing german victory as morning dragged on the luftwaffe concentrated its forces in support of the ground assault in the northern sector the first flieger division's efforts earned the germans initial air superiority observing friendly bomber squadrons and friendly escorts passing overhead the commander of the 10th panzer grenadier division reported that the soviet air forces seemed to be neutralized however during the afternoon the situation began to change as the 9th army headquarters noted that haphazard and fragmented soviet air attacks gradually gained in intensity and unity thanks to their overwhelming numbers some soviet planes managed to slip through the luftwaffe's defenses allowing them to strafe and bomb advancing elements of the armored spearheads in the south the situation followed a similar pattern despite encountering tenacious resistance the lieb standarta ss adolf hitler reported outstanding support from our stukas as their highly accurate airstrikes directed by air liaison officers managed to knock out numerous well-entrenched red army positions all was not sunshine and sauerkraut for the germans however while the eighth flier corps was fully engaged in support of the main advance the soviet 17th air army was able to mount concentrated attacks on the exposed and largely undefended german flank pilots and planes were at a premium forcing luftwaffe pilots to fly several sorties a day while their soviet foes struck where the germans were vulnerable for a typical pilot's schedule let's look at first lieutenant earhart jennert of the third group of stutz kampfkeshwada trai jainage had started his first sortie of the day at 2 50 am to support the initial thrust of the ninth army by the time he clocked out around 640 he had flown six missions with a total flight time of 7 hours in total german pilots flew 4 800 sorties after just a single day of fighting by comparison the combined soviet air armies had only flown about 3390 with more pilots flying fewer missions regardless the luftwaffe's efforts had failed to facilitate a considerable breakthrough as neither thrust had managed to advance much beyond their starting lines for this small consolation the soviet air force had paid the high price of 300 aircraft lost including captain vladimir zelevsky one of the soviet union's few surviving fighter aces and recipient of the title hero of the soviet union whose fighter was shot down during the morning's engagements by contrast the luftwaffe had only lost about 60 of its planes although its pilots were greatly outnumbered it was clear that the luftwaffe's experience still gave it a considerable edge however general konstantine rakosovsky felt that the germans would only be able to maintain this level of support for so long before fatigue and attrition took their toll the soviet's deep well of manpower and its titanic manufacturing infrastructure would allow them to grind the fascists down rakosovsky promised stalin that air superiority would be achieved the following day [Music] his optimism would not be immediately realized however july 6 started with more heavy losses for the soviet air force when the 16th air army lost 91 planes during a botched counter-attack after a few of its fighters alerted the intercepting germans to the direction of the attack the fighting was fierce in the other sectors as well as 23 year old soviet la-5 pilot yvonne kojodup could tell you although many of his unfortunate comrades were shot down that day kushidub survived and managed to score his first victory during an attack against a group of stuka dive bombers nevertheless soviet losses were so high that high command had to transfer fighters from other wings to ensure the 16th survival in the southern sector losses were somewhat less catastrophic with the soviet 2nd and 17th air armies having lost a total of 80 planes by the end of the day by comparison the luftwaffe counted only 22 aircraft lost most of which were due to anti-aircraft fire after two days of fighting it was clear that rokosovsky had failed to fulfill his promises to stalin meanwhile the front line on the ground had hardly moved at all on july 7th the fortunes of war seemed to finally shift in the soviet's favor a bombing raid took the second panzer division by surprise as it was assembling for its scheduled morning attack caught the open the unit suffered considerable losses later that day the division's assault was bogged down when strong stuka support failed to break the soviet defense and soviet bomber and stermovic raids continually harassed the advance the luftwaffe's efforts had come at the cost of pilot kurt albert papa a knight's crossholder with over 350 missions to his name whose stuka was shot down by yak-1 fighters but all was not sunshine and stroganoff for the soviets a counter-attack in the south utterly collapsed when german ground attack aircraft armed with anti-tank cannons wiped out the second guard tank core marking the first time in the history of warfare that an entire tank formation had been defeated by air power alone however as the battle raged it became increasingly clear that the luftwaffe's air support was proving insufficient to help the northern advance break through towards kursk the intensity of the battle cost the germans dearly with the luftwaffe losing three of its most experienced stuka pilots in one day the soviet air force on the other hand was starting to mold its own aces on july 8th the budding ivan kojodup added to his tally and managed to shoot down two bf-109 fighters he described his kills thusly i held the firing button squeeze and blasted away a long burst and it was sufficient the leader turned over from his steep dive and i saw him hit the ground we would like to think that kojodup later commented that it's always sunny in leningrad due to the lack of progress in the northern sector half of the first flieger division was transferred to support a possible breakthrough in the south there the bolstered air support helped the ss totenkopf division overrun the third soviet defensive belt besides its accuracy the shtuka's infamous siren terrified inexperienced red army soldiers the russians run from stukas reported the totenkopf division the neighboring coast deutschland division was similarly impressed with the luftwaffe's performance noting in its daily report while the enemy forces limited themselves to attack against targets in the rear our luftwaffe above all the stuka offered absolutely outstanding support to the panzer spearhead with notable success back in the north the remaining stuka formations took off to support a desperate final push by the ninth army to break through the soviet line however strong russian counter-attacks supported by its own larger air force managed to push the germans back by then it was becoming clear that the german offensive would not be able to reach kursk having only managed to advance a few miles into the heavily defended salient the northern advance was ordered to halt on july 12th a few days later the southern thrust would be ground to a halt as well operation citadel had failed after a week of near-constant fighting the soviet air force had suffered about 1200 losses by comparison the luftwaffe had only lost around 240 of its own aircraft by all accounts the latter had clearly outclassed its counterpart on the battlefield moreover the luftwaffe's flying artillery had proven its worth twofold against the deeply entrenched soviet defenders however this tactical superiority ultimately failed to bring the offensive to a successful conclusion although the luftwaffe had managed to keep the numerically superior soviet air force at bay it simply lacked the strength in numbers to make a difference to the course of the battle moreover with the added help of len least aircraft the soviet strategic reserve could afford to absorb the heavy toll it suffered at the hands of the luftwaffe the same could not be said of the germans even though their aircraft losses were relatively manageable the offensive had come at the considerable cost of several of its most experienced pilots in addition the strain of combat and the constant pressure from the soviet air force had totally exhausted the german forces by the end of the offensive the soviet air force would only grow stronger and more experienced as 1944 began by the end of the battle of kursk in august the luftwaffe had seated control over the skies the valkyries of hitler's germany would ride no longer [Music] you\",\n",

will turn the tide of a war hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian the seeds that would grow into the korean war were sown in 1945 when the soviet red army invaded the peninsula following its declaration of war on imperial japan which had held korea since 1910 soviet forces advanced down the peninsula until they reached the 38th parallel then halted while the u.s troops landed in the south and moved to meet them splitting the peninsula in two the soviets established a communist provisional government in the north elevating kim il-sung a hero of the insurgency against japan to the head of government consolidating power sung declared the formation of the democratic people's republic of korea espousing democratic socialism but practicing brutal authoritarianism with north korea lost to communism the americans decided to push back by establishing the first republic of korea but this state was hardly a bastion of liberty and democracy if you're a regular viewer you no doubt enjoy

korea's first experience with democracy bore a disappointing resemblance to affairs in the dprk when elections were held in july of 1948 u.s backed candidate sigmund re just barely made it over the threshold with an entirely unsuspicious 92.6 percent of the popular vote both rei's administration in the south and song's administration in the north wanted nothing more than to reunite the two halves of the peninsula under their respective governments making conflict between north and south inevitable re declared his intent to reconquer the north to american envoys and followed up his statements with a soviet-style purge of ideological opponents including the chechu uprising by communist elements which led to between thirty thousand and sixty thousand casualties ree's roughshod approach caused his american backers to limit their investment in what they saw more akin to a diet democracy than a truly free state even if re had gotten his war american support would have been hard to come by the readiness of america's ground forces had dropped precipitously and by 1950 of the 10 combat divisions in the united states army only one the 82nd airborne was considered combat ready all u.s forces had also been evacuated in late 1949 leaving the south defended exclusively by the republic of korea army or rok army observing this weakness kim il-sung began to believe that he could rapidly invade and conquer south korea eventually song launched his invasion but claimed to his dying day that it was a righteous response to a surprise attack from the south which was conveniently defeated so decisively by the korean people's army that no evidence of the invaders was left meanwhile in his memoirs nikita khrushchev stated i must stress that the war wasn't stalin's idea but kim il-sung's kim was the initiator stalin of course didn't try to dissuade him the korean war was a very unique kind of proxy war where the larger us and ussr were mostly against a conflict that their clients in korea were all too keen to initiate and initiate what they did in the early hours of june 25th 1950 the korean people's army or kpa crossed the 38th parallel with an armored spearhead of 150 t-3485 rapidly pushing the rok army back towards seoul and capturing both kaesong and oijeongbu yet despite the dire situation it was late evening before news reached the secretary of defense who begrudgingly woke up long enough to leave orders for general douglas macarthur to investigate rumors of a disturbance along the 38th parallel before going back to sleep while he slumbered the rock army chief of staff chai pyeongduk was seemingly busy doing his best to lose the war as quickly as possible thanks to multiple communication failures his counter-attack with the second and seventh divisions east of oijongbu broke down in confusion the isolated first division put up fierce resistance but with limited anti-tank weaponry they could do little against the horde of t-34s with retreat as the only reasonable course of action general che instead ordered his troops to hold fast soon the first division was alone fighting a doomed last stand as the static south korean positions were systematically president reed then fled seoul and just two days after the invasion began the capital fell to the kpa general macarthur then ordered the commander of the eighth u.s army lieutenant general walton walker to prepare all available forces in the far east and immediately dispatch them to south korea this turned out to be a depressingly tiny force consisting of only the 24th infantry division armed with a charmingly vintage arsenal dating back from the second world war even worse only six transport planes were available which could carry a single battalion this battalion was designated task force smith and was quickly launched to secure the vital port of busan at dawn on july 5th task force smith engaged the kpa for the first time at the battle of osan but their equipment proved useless against kpa tanks and they were quickly overwhelmed however they did hold just long enough for the bulk of the 24th infantry division to secure busan unfortunately all other actions the 24th participated in afterward were abject failures and the unit eventually sustained over 6 000 casualties including its commander but these sacrifices bought time for the united states to mobilize its full military might within days america had established total air and naval superiority the korean sky constantly filled with withering bombing raids on both the invading army and north korean infrastructure yet kim il-sung refused to back down and on august 4th the kpa launched an all-out assault on the perimeter around busan the kpa found the americans well dug in and the assault morphed into a protracted battle of attrition but the perimeter came close to collapse on august 15th when a push across the naktong river by the kpa's elite troops managed to carve a salient known as the naktong bridge only the timely arrival of reinforcements averted disaster all while american air and naval assets kept the north koreans from consolidating their gains as they proceeded to devastate kpa supply lines while the battle for busan raged on general macarthur was busy coordinating an amphibious landing at incheon a hundred miles or 160 kilometers behind enemy lines when told that inchon was heavily defended and that adverse sea conditions made any landing a daunting prospect anyway macarthur responded thusly the very arguments you have made as to the impractic abilities involved will tend to ensure for me the element of surprise for the north korean commander will reason that no one would be so brash as to make such an attempt being so brash macarthur got the plan approved in late august and to everyone's surprise the landing at inchon proved a massive success this forced the kpa to pull forces away from busan allowing the defenders to stage a breakout on the 25th this was the last straw for the north koreans and their morale finally shattered with hundreds of soldiers surrendering on mass as the americans drove north and attracted the attention of chinese border troops at the yalu river with incheon secured u.n forces began their drive to liberate seoul the road to seoul was a grueling campaign which saw intense combat around airfields and strong points flamethrowers and massive bombardments played a key role in dislodging stubborn kpa troops the fighting only worsened when u.n troops met the kpa in the second battle of seoul brutal house-to-house combat saw thousands of kpa soldiers killed while american casualties hovered close to 300. un forces ultimately seized the city on september 28th the invasion of south korea had been defeated not just by american forces but by a coalition including thai ethiopian british canadian and dutch soldiers coming together for a truly international response morale was high victory was sweet and with your friend and mind douglas macarthur leading the charge the thought on the ground was what could go possibly wrong with south korea secured macarthur and his superiors were left debating whether or not to go for a killing blow against kim il-sung's regime singman re was still determined to reunite the peninsula under his rule and the men on the ground were eager to take revenge on the north for the casualties they had suffered during the brutal fighting around busan and the nakhdang river ultimately the joint chiefs authorized macarthur to invade north korea as long as such operations had a reasonable chance of success as the americans rested on their laurels and planned for their invasion of north korea the people's republic of china moved troops closer to north korea ultimately assembling a force of almost half a million men at the yalu river after the intense battles in the south pyongyang fell with astonishing ease the dispirited kpa offered virtually no resistance and the capital was taken on october 19th the u.s joint chiefs of staff ordered macarthur to prepare the way for unification of a free and independent korea unaware that u.n success had awakened a sleeping giant the people's republic of china china had watched the korean war with concern concerned that only grew as their ideological brethren in the north were routed by the capitalist forces the same day pyongyang was captured 300 000 soldiers of the people's army led by veterans of the chinese civil war crossed the border into korean territory and a whole new phase of the conflict began the first chinese offensive began on october 25th with an easy victory at the battle of unson but the people's army did not press its advantage withdrawing quickly back into the mountains then just a week after the first offensive the north korean winter set in with temperatures dropping to -8 degrees fahrenheit or minus 22 degrees celsius accompanied by howling gales in spite of these appalling conditions macarthur insisted that the offensive continue but the second encounter with the chinese at the changshan river on november 25th was a disaster with the rock second corps being wiped out and the us 8th army being thrown into a disorderly route then on the 27th the 30 000 strong us 10th corps was encircled by over 120 000 chinese soldiers near the chosan reservoir for 17 days the americans fought desperately to escape the trap before finally breaking out to the port of hangnam where they were evacuated the survivors were dubbed the chosen few in a bitter play on words chosan reservoir was a horrendous battle with chinese forces regularly offering no quarter to their american adversaries left with no choice the u.n coalition was forced to go on the defensive and pyongyang was abandoned on the 5th of december the rapid retreat saw both u.n forces and korean civilians withdraw before the chinese advance and the journey south was fraught with accidents and tragedies including the death of general walker commander of all u.s army forces in korea only a personal visit to the troops by walker's successor general matthew b ridgeway for stalled outright panic even so there was nothing the coalition could do to stop the enemy advance and in january seven chinese armies washed over seoul forcing the defenders to retreat and soul changed hands for the third time relief for the shell-shocked defenders only came when the chinese supply lines were broken by u.s air power forcing them to begin a slow withdrawal back to the 38th parallel the un's fortunes had well and truly turned yet general macarthur remained convinced that victory was possible and even pressured president truman to authorize the use of nuclear weapons on korean soil after weeks of enduring this insubordinate behavior truman sacked macarthur and promoted general ridgway in his place meanwhile the chinese were experiencing issues of their own coalition air superiority remained absolute and north korea now resembled a moonscape of craters from ceaseless u.s bomber attacks ridgeway undertook several initiatives in his new position operation wolfhound saw a massive air reconnaissance effort revealed the people's army were holding their positions if not withdrawing and ridgeway capitalized on this information to launch operation thunderbolt a new drive toward seoul thunderbolt brought the un forces to the city but the daring offensive operation ripper saw the capital change hands for the fourth and final time from this point on ridgeway and the un forces doubled down on their philosophy of overwhelming firepower leveraging superior american military technology to level the playing field with the overwhelming numbers of the people's army ridgeway became focused on destroying the chinese rather than retaking north korea but the war devolved into a stalemate of attrition with salience developing in the shifting lines and hardpoints like porkchop hill and white horse mountain changing hands in bloody tugs of war superior firepower or not the people's army was still in the fight and the us joint chiefs estimated that a renewed march on pyongyang would result in a minimum of 200 000 u.s casualties an utterly unthinkable price for the war-weary american public to be asked to pay as the u.n troops duked it out with the chinese politicians in washington began to push for a settlement they saw little chance of ending the conflict any other way peace talks began in mid-1951 while ridgway and his cohorts continued to battle the chinese but neither side wanted to risk admitting defeat fearful of the reaction from both their government and their constituents belligerent diplomats and petty cultural misunderstandings caused negotiations to stall on multiple occasions as a result there was also the thorny issue of pows over 60 000 korean and chinese prisoners refused repatriation preferring to stay in the south this would result in much bickering between the two sides dragging matters on for over a year until a ceasefire agreement was finally agreed on on july 27 1953 the deal established a demilitarized zone at the 38th parallel and set up a neutral nations repatriation commission to settle the ongoing pow issue sigmund re naturally refused to sign the agreement and officially north and south korea are still at war to this very day when all was said and done the status quo came at the cost of three million lives most of whom were civilians both sides committed a number of massacres but the united states denied their own war crimes in korea for many years while publicizing the brutality of their enemies from 2005 to 2010 a south korean commission conducted a large-scale investigation of war crimes concluding that 82 percent were perpetrated by south korean forces with 18 perpetrated by north korean forces many were motivated by fears of communist insurgents hiding among civilian populations like its cold war cousin the vietnam war the korean war was a long bloody and ultimately futile conflict the only difference was that the u.s succeeded in forgetting korea [Music]\",\n",
       " \" it is just after midnight in the bay of pigs a lone cuban soldier crouches behind a rock the bodies of his patrol mates are strewn around him their position lit up by the burning jeep they arrived in all he can do is pray their last desperate radio transmission gets through and that news of the imperialist invasion reaches headquarters in time a shadowed figure leans into view and the militiamen sees his chance for revenge the horrible revelation strikes harder than any bullet that was no imperialist dog instead the shocked face was that of his own countrymen the thoughts of both cuban-born soldiers fill with regret as they lie they wonder how it all came to this in the end they will be just two of over 3 500 cuban casualties in a cia-backed invasion that pitted brother against brother and ultimately accomplished nothing but driving cuba right into the arms of the soviet union hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian the bay of pig's invasion took place in april of 1961 and was the culmination of america's efforts to unseat prime minister fidel castro of cuba who had swept to power three years earlier in a popular revolution against the u.s backed dictator fulgencio batista although supposedly planned in absolute secrecy the operation had been compromised almost from the beginning by cuban and soviet intelligence despite its abject failure the invasion was neither the first time america had tried to interfere in cuba nor would it be the last a state of affairs that would lead the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation in the cuban missile crisis in this video we will examine the often studied crisis from the perspective of the cuban people both the pro-castro and anti-communist factions who in modern study are cast as background characters in

game which is available for both xbox and playstation users through the link in the description below the successful cuban revolution that took place between 1953 and 1959 was an unprecedented victory for the growing socialist movement in latin america which arose in response to the blatantly exploitative practices of u.s big businesses backed by the world's largest capitalist economy international corporations monopolized trade in lucrative local produce and used their immense profits to dominate local elections and install corrupt officials who turned a blind eye to their shameless pillaging it was the era of neocolonialism with many latin american countries being run as imperialist outposts while maintaining the veneer of sovereignty and economic development whenever this stranglehold on the continent was threatened the united states shed any pretenses of upholding democracy and resorted to sabotage this hypocrisy was on full display in 1954 when the cia overthrew the legitimately elected president of guatemala in favor for an anti-communist military junta it is no wonder then that the first signs of american interference in cuban affairs began as soon as fidel castro revealed his intentions to dismantle their monopoly on his nation's vast sugar plantations some cubans in the direst straits saw this as a chance to finally seize the means of production away from the faceless overseas corporations that had dominated their lives for decades expectedly the u.s reacted with aggressive sanctions and the revolutionaries lacked enough experience to maintain the economy while simultaneously supporting castro's many new social welfare programs aimed at uplifting the rural poor but this progress was dearly bought and castro sought to protect his nascent workers utopia at all costs from the start he made it very clear that the resources and social programs of his new government were exclusively available to fellow revolutionaries those cuban citizens who did not openly embrace socialism were ostracized at best and permanently re-educated at worst for those who dared betray their cuban heritage and openly side with the americans immediate exile was the best they could hope for what divided these two camps was not a matter of national pride but of politics just about all cubans were patriots tired of witnessing their island's exploitation but what divided them was castro's agenda resistance movements soon sprang up but without a powerful backer there was little they could accomplish that's when the cia approached members of the cuban democratic revolutionary front offering to transport 1400 men across the caribbean sea and onto the island where they would proceed to liberate the nation from castro's regime however this endeavor was doomed from the start and the men who participated in it ultimately accomplished nothing besides convincing their socialist brothers and sisters that the us was utterly and completely dedicated to the destruction of their new workers republic the invasion to topple their communist regime only succeeded in making cuba more communist [Music] on december 2nd castro pledged fealty to the soviet union in a televised address declaring i am a marxist leninist and shall be one until the end of my life he went on to state that soviet-style communism would be the guiding force in cuban politics replacing the more generalized set of socialist ideals his regime had previously adhered to to the cuban exiles living abroad in florida and mexico this was the worst case scenario reducing the nation they loved to little more than a pawn in the struggle between the soviets and the americans however things were not quite as clear-cut as they seemed following his passionate endorsement of communism castro was confused by a lukewarm and non-committal soviet reaction he had inadvertently placed the ussr and first secretary nikita khrushchev in a particularly awkward position as cuba could not receive soviet military aid without sparking an american response but even without soviet support castro did his best to prove his worth in the eyes of his new marxist leninist peers going so far as to send his own 13 year old son fidelito to a school in moscow but it was not until early 1962 that castro was validated by the soviets suddenly soviet newspapers began publishing articles praising his regime as a model of marxist leninist efficiency shortly afterwards castro received word that khrushchev was sending two senior members of his government martial sergey birusof and party secretary sharaf rashidov to speak with him about securing cuba's future at this historic meeting an astonished castro listened as the two men carefully laid out khrushchev's plan to station no less than 40 nuclear-tipped ballistic cruise missiles on the island defended by a large soviet garrison and numerous anti-aircraft batteries armed with such weapons cuba would be nothing less than an impregnable fortress able to threaten nuclear armageddon on any impertinent foe who dared challenge its sovereignty remarkably castro did not instantly accept this proposal realizing that the soviets were not making it purely out of the kindness of their hearts his nation would not have direct ownership or even access to these new missiles and castro worried that the u.s might launch a preemptive attack if they were discovered prior to installation even the promise of additional equipment for the cuban army and the knowledge that he was acting in the cause of international socialism was not enough to fully overcome castro's misgivings but in the end he convinced himself that it would be morally wrong not to accept the deal as he had already put great pressure on the ussr to defend his revolution while having little practical value to offer in return therefore with some reluctance castro agreed to the soviet plan between july and august of 1962 various high-profile members of the cuban government traveled to moscow to negotiate the details of the soviet military installation these included fidel's brother raul castro and his close comrade ernesto che guevara the soviets threw lavish parties for both the dignitaries and arranged tours of various secret military facilities while raoul came back full of praise for their new allies che was more reserved suspicious of the way khrushchev seemed to downplay the threat posed by the usa during their personal meetings during the negotiations both sides drafted multiple agreements finally settling on terms that would see over 40 000 soviet boots on the ground in cuba in addition to the missiles construction of the missile sites needed to take place under absolute secrecy but castro was confident his state security apparatus would be more than up to the task however his regime was still facing numerous threats both foreign and domestic that made keeping his promises to the soviets much more difficult than initially anticipated for starters the cuban economy had continued to sharply decline thanks to a mixture of incompetent administration and u.s sanctions leading to food riots in several cities the cia had also initiated operation mongoose in 1961 which had the goal of inciting a civil revolt in cuba within a year the program included everything from assassination attempts on castro to terrorist attacks carried out on cuban infrastructure indeed the cia would plot to assassinate castro so many times in such absurd variety of ways such as with exploding seashells poisoned milkshakes and fungus infected wetsuits that he famously stated if surviving assassination attempts were an olympic event i would win the gold medal there was also an ongoing insurgency movement known as the s combrai rebellion made up of former batista loyalists and cubans who opposed castro's socialist government these bandidos managed to make such a nuisance of themselves that soviet assessors rejected cuba's thick inner jungles as potential locations for their new missile sites partially because they provided the perfect cover for guerrilla operations the sites were instead placed in more open locations leaving them vulnerable to discovery despite the regime's efforts the cuban public soon became aware of an increased soviet presence in their homeland soon a constant game of cat and mouse was being played between castro's security forces and the alleged cia informants security was paramount as only castro and his closest associates were supposed to know the full details of the plan and anyone who caught wind of the details outside that closed circle had to be silenced of course cuba's little secret was never going to stay hidden for long the u.s had been flying u2 spy planes over the island since its failed invasion and on october 14th a u2 flight successfully photographed the missile site at san cristobal eight days later president john f kennedy made a televised 18-minute speech in which he revealed to the world the unmistakable evidence of missile bases in cuba and announced a blockade that would not only prevent further shipments of soviet arms and personnel but any shipping from reaching the island the cuban missile crisis had officially begun at least that was as far as the rest of the world was concerned within cuba itself almost all mention of international events was suppressed save for the narrative maintained by the state but this was not enough to keep the populace from realizing the danger posed by the missiles and people began to stream in from the countryside to be with their families in the close-knit society of cuba preparations for nuclear war took second place to simply being together with loved ones if the worst came to the worst even so only a few senior officials within the government fully understood the gravity of the situation and fewer still were able to shed the blinders of ideology and accept the utter devastation that a nuclear war would cause but men like fidel castro and che guevara had built their reputation by being both steadfast and uncompromising and neither intended to back down in the face of american threats to che guevara especially this was nothing less than the final struggle between capitalism and communism and nuclear war was completely acceptable if not preferable to achieve the extinction of the former and the triumph of the latter immediately after kennedy's declaration castro took to the podium issuing a stinging rebuttal that outlined america's long history of aggression and state-sponsored terrorism against his beloved nation when it came time to address the issue of soviet missiles castro had this to say what have we done we have defended ourselves that is all were the imperialists expecting that after their first hostile act our people would surrender that the revolution would raise a white flag determined to show his resolve the fiery castro passionately urged khrushchev to issue a declaration stating that any attack on cuban soil would be seen as an attack on the ussr itself and to have his forces deployed throughout europe to enter a state of maximum readiness khrushchev had absolutely no intention of doing either of these things kennedy too had played his hand carefully having announced that the planned blockade would occur well outside of cuba's territorial waters and castro realized that he had been neatly taken out of the diplomatic equation leaving him with next to no say in any talks between america and the ussr but there was still the matter of u.s reconnaissance flights taking place over cuban airspace on a daily basis fully convincing castro that american action was imminent on october 26th castro sent another letter to khrushchev stating his conviction that an attack would take place within the next 72 hours and that he expected the ussr to respond with the full force of their nuclear arsenal he then ordered his army to engage any u.s planes that violated his airspace this was a fateful decision as within 24 hours a u2 spy plane had been successfully shot down using soviet-supplied surface-to-air missiles the incident shocked the world instantly escalating tensions to a whole new level kennedy's ears filled with calls from his staff to retaliate and safeguards around american missiles were relaxed to ensure they could be fired with minimal approval surely castro thought this would be enough to push khrushchev into action and yet ironically castro's determination to escalate the conflict ultimately proved to be one of the biggest factors that led to its peaceful resolution in the words of khrushchev's own son sergey it was at that very moment not before or after that father felt the situation was slipping out of his control kennedy made a similar realization concluding that the cuban army had been acting outside of soviet jurisdiction the truth was that neither side wanted nuclear war under any circumstances and castro's belligerent attitude brought home just how dangerous it was to have lou's cannon rolling around the deck of the ship of state while negotiations were taking place both khrushchev and kennedy made a firm resolution to ignore any further warmongering advice from their subordinates and began taking steps to defuse the situation as quickly as possible while these events played out at the highest levels of government ordinary cubans including those who had fled the country awaited the outcome with bated breath a cuban exile living in miami marta darby recalls the tension in an interview on national public radio where she stated i think at the time we were afraid that maybe something would happen to us much like the japanese internment camps during world war ii and there were whispers of that maybe they'll take us away and hide us somewhere and that was a little bit scary when asked about her experiences as a child still living in cuba during the same interview maria salgado recalled i also remember family members from out of town coming in and everyone being in our same hometown because the world was going to end so you wanted to be near your family near your loved ones as october 28 dawned an increasingly nervous and expectant castro received a phone call from khrushchev informing him that a deal had been signed that would see the removal of missiles from cuba in exchange for a guarantee that no invasion of the island would take place with trembling hands castro lowered the receiver how dare khrushchev do this to him cuba had risked everything for this moment castro had personally offered his life and the lives of his countrymen as a sacrifice on the altar of communism and had been ready to die with a smile on his face if it meant striking a death blow to the hated imperialists but instead castro's supposed allies had acted without even consulting him disregarding his pride and cuban sovereignty in favor of extracting a few concessions over missile sites in turkey in a fit of impotent fury castro trashed his office kicking the walls and smashing glassware while screaming obscenities at khrushchev ending with an emphatic insult i will politely decline from translating after he had finally calmed down the embittered prime minister issued a public statement that he would accept the deal but the u.s also had to cease all attempts to interfere with cuban sovereignty and swear never to violate their airspace or territorial waters again as part of the deal the americans had secured rights to send inspectors to cuba to monitor the removal of the soviet missile sites but castro made it clear that any u.s personnel who so much as set foot on his soil would be shot dead and their bodies tossed back into the ocean despite mounting pressure from both sides the revolutionary leader held firm his wounded pride demanding appeasement meanwhile disaffected cubans chanted in the streets khrushchev you coward what is given as a gift is not taken away again state media went into overdrive pumping out article after article decrying this deliberate betrayal of cuban loyalty faced with the unyielding resolve from both leader and citizenry even the mighty ussr had to give in eventually after weeks of defiance castro won a morale victory with the soviets agreeing to ship the missiles out into international waters to be inspected there instead of on cuban soil as suddenly as they began the newspaper articles and radio broadcasts condemning the soviet withdrawal came to an end and the sullen populace of cuba resumed their normal lives with nothing left to do castro descended into a state of depression his bad mood was exacerbated when many communist parties in latin america began praising khrushchev for how well he had handled the situation che guevara also reacted to the crisis with disgust later stating that he would have personally fired the missiles himself if it meant destroying the usa forever in the years that followed the missile crisis relations between cuba and the ussr slowly returned to normal but a sense of betrayal still hung over the island nation the radical communists of cuba had been willing to die for their ideals and felt that the russians had snatched defeat from the jaws of victory regular citizens were kept somewhat ignorant of the true nature of the crisis as for the many cuban exiles who had watched the whole affair on international news they were relieved that the situation had been de-escalated but saddened by the fact that their homeland still remained in communist hands the descendants of these exiles continue to call for the democratization of cuba to this day and though the government has made a few concessions over the years the status quo remains more or less intact fidel castro died on the 25th of november 2016 at the age of 90. he remains extremely popular among cuban socialists who view him as their liberator and as someone who always shared their burdens and endured hardship alongside the common man special thanks again to world of warships legends for sponsoring this video enjoy the new carrier update and far more content

denial his predecessor's request for permission to withdraw from kiev has finally been approved but it is too late only the day before german forces from the north and south had met up to the east of timochenko's position cutting off his last chance to escape the largest encirclement in history was now complete and there was nothing he could do to prevent the disaster that was coming hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian during the german invasion of the soviet union in 1941 heavy fighting occurred in the soviet republic of ukraine it was there in the ancient ukrainian capital

you're ready to secure your future head over to policygenius.com armchair historian and get started right now policy genius when it comes to insurance it's nice to get it right less than two months after germany's invasion of the soviet union its forces had driven deep into russian territory after the initial success of their offensive german forces began preparing to secure the flanks of the rapidly advancing army group center and eradicate more of the enemy's forces in the north and south to accomplish this adolf hitler directed elements of army group center to assist army group north in assaulting leningrad and help army group south capture central ukraine while many of his generals were supposedly unhappy with this decision the orders were carried out and german forces began to advance toward the ukrainian capital of kiev in early august by this time army group south's invasion of ukraine was already underway with the reinforcements from army group center their force now consisted of 25 infantry divisions and nine armored divisions for a total of 544 000 men set against them were the forces of the soviet southern and southwestern fronts under the overall command of marshall simeon timoshenko on august 8th the germans finished off a pocket of soviet troops at the town of uman which had been encircled in mid-july inflicting over 200 000 casualties with these men gone the task of defending central ukraine fell almost entirely on the southwestern front consisting of 627 000 troops under general mikhail kirpanos after the battle of uman kirpanos's forces fell back and established a strong defensive line against army group south along the nyapur river holding fast against german attacks from the west and south on august 22nd elements of army group center crossed the nipper and began to besiege the city from the north the soviets held fast in the face of the german assault using the strong defensive positions of the marshes north of kiev but kirpanos quickly recognized the dire threat of encirclement he faced he sent a request to the soviet high command for permission to withdraw but joseph stalin denied this request personally ordering kirpanos to hold kiev at all costs unwilling to defy orders he had his men dig in and prepare to defend the city even as the noose tightened around him at the end of august the second panzer group and second army of army group center under the command of heinz budarian overcame the soviets tough defenses in the north by employing the brilliant tactic of going around them and began steadily making their way south initially kirpanos was hopeful that he could fend off this attack expecting that the german spearhead would overextend itself trying to encircle him and become vulnerable to counter-attacks in the meantime he ordered the brian's front under lieutenant general andrei yarimenka to harass guderian's tank group and slow its advance with the eventual goal of encircling and destroying them although this ultimate objective was next to impossible the brian's front succeeded in delaying the second panzer group with a series of guerilla attacks throughout late august and the first weeks of september however yerimenko's forces suffered heavy losses and as fewer and fewer of his soldiers returned the second panzer group continued its advance [Music] any remaining hope kirpanos may have had of stopping the encirclement was shattered when he received word that the first panzer group of army group south had secretly crossed the nyepur on september 12th and was rapidly advancing northeast to meet up with their comrades from army group center these armored units rapidly cut across the rear of the southwestern front and it soon became obvious that total encirclement of the forces in kiev was inevitable the soviet staff could only relay these developments to stalin and pray he would finally see reason this dire news apparently woke stalin up to the reality of the situation and so he did what any good leader would do designated a scapegoat to take the blame he chose marshall boudiani commander of the soviet forces in the ukraine and his longtime political ally the day after the first panzer group made it across the river stalin unceremoniously fired budyani declaring him unfit to command a modern army and relegating him to a non-combat command for the rest of his career he was replaced by marshal simeon timoshenko who was expected to salvage the rapidly deteriorating situation the first and second panzer groups were closing in from the north and south and nothing the soviets threw at them could stop the armored jaws of the german wolf from closing in around kiev a glimmer of good news arrived on the night of the 13th when the forward elements of budarian's forces were successfully repelled from the town of lubny there a ragtag force engaged the german troops sniping from rooftops and windows and bombarding their tanks with molotov cocktails the fighting tied up the german division in lubny for days preventing them from linking up with the first panzer group and closing the encirclement but this victory merely delayed the inevitable and that same evening one of timoshenko's subordinates sent a blunt telegram to boris shaposhnikov marshall of the red army which ended with the words this is the beginning as you know of catastrophe a matter of a couple of days sure enough on september 16th guderian's second panzer group met up with the first panzer group in the town of lachvitsa about 120 miles east of kiev the encirclement was complete and four soviet armies were now trapped inside the pocket german leaders were surprised by the extent of their success and the seemingly static soviet response upon hearing the news german general gotthard heinrichy remarked in an incomprehensible manner the russian has left his troops to remain in a situation in the ukraine which must result in their capture in a truly dismal example of irony the now encircled soviet forces received a telegram the very next day from marshall shaposhnikov finally authorizing them to withdraw from kiev with nowhere to run the soviets could do nothing but settle into their defensive positions and prepare to make the germans pay for every mile on september 18th the luftwaffe began to bombard kiev in ernst with the stated aim of reducing the city to rubble and ashes dropping over 1.2 million pounds of bombs over the course of the battle meanwhile the german ground forces systematically advanced from all directions slowly crushing all enemy resistance in the east where the german line was the thinnest the soviets made several desperate attempts to break out but to no avail a report to high command on the 17th described enemy formations bounding off the encirclement ring like billiard balls the soviets were incredibly tenacious fighting tooth and nail even after days of constant combat with no sleep as lines of communication broke down the forces remaining inside the pocket were overtaken by utter confusion and the battle soon turned into a slaughter the city of kiev was finally occupied on the 19th with nazi flags flying above the citadel by midday unlike other cities which the soviets largely destroyed on their way out as part of their brutal scorched earth policy kiev was captured with much of the inner city intact the nazis quickly set about occupying most important buildings establishing supply depots and command headquarters which was exactly what the soviets had been counting on five days after the germans entered kiev a series of explosions shook the city as hundreds of explosives hidden by the nkvd were set off 200 german soldiers and officers were killed and much of the city was destroyed in the resulting firestorm meanwhile fighting continued to the east of kiev the remnants of the southwestern front were broken up into several separate pockets which continued to fight stubbornly even as their officers died and their formations dissolved general kirpanos was forced to flee his headquarters as the germans closed in and wound up leading a small group of soldiers in a desperate attempt to break out of the encirclement the general and his haggard escort encountered the enemy nine miles from la christa and kirpanos died fighting alongside his men most of the other commanding officers were more fortunate and managed to escape with their headquarters including marshals budyani and timoshenko along with the up and coming commissar nikita khrushchev around 15 000 soviets managed to escape with them leaving the rest of the southwestern front to its fate on september 26th after 10 days of intense fighting the last scattered remnants of the encircled forces surrendered marking the end of the battle in total the soviets lost upwards of seven hundred thousand men in the encirclement at kiev with four whole armies being completely destroyed over the following weeks the nazis in ukraine began to massacre prisoners and civilians alike enslaving hundreds of thousands to serve as forced laborers the greatest atrocity occurred at the babinyar ravine just outside of kiev in retaliation for the bombings in the city the entire jewish population of kiev over 33 000 people were rounded up and taken to a ravine where they were systematically forced into the ravine and shot one small group at a time after the massacre of babinyar the ravine continued to be used as a mass grave for murdered jews and would claim anywhere from forty thousand to one hundred thousand more lives during the german occupation [Music] the battle of kiev was a devastating loss for the soviet union handing complete control of central ukraine to the germans but even in the midst of its greatest victory the cracks in the nazi war machine were beginning to show damaged or disabled panzers outstripped the maintenance system's capacity to repair and the lack of sufficient rail networks put a strain on german supply lines meanwhile with the nkvd bombings in kiev the soviets were already developing one of the tactics that would help them turn the tide of the war scorched earth successful as it had been the prolonged assault on kiev had robbed the german invasion of its momentum a delay that they could ill afford as the dreaded russian wet season known as the rasputitsa would hit a little over one month after kiev was secured [Music] [Music] you\",\n",
       " \" the young spearman pulls his cloak tighter trying desperately to ward off the biting wind as their feet crunch through the snow drifts the carthaginian soldiers have little time to marvel at the majestic peaks that surround them they have braved unfamiliar weather hostile natives and precarious terrain to reach their goal italia home of their hated roman enemies for 17 years carthage and rome have vied for supremacy in the mediterranean with the great city of rome spared the horrors of war but with this march the carthaginians plan to change that the spearman's musings are interrupted by a shout with a final roar a war elephant loses its footing and plummets into an alpine crevasse taking a handful of men with it he pulls his cloak tighter hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian the ancient mediterranean was the scene of an epic clash between two empires to determine who would control the area the roman republic and the carthaginian empire carthage initially enjoyed good relations with the romans but as the two powers quickly grew into the lead players of the western mediterranean stage conflict became inevitable in this video we will examine the punic wars from the carthaginian perspective the conflict in which the largely mercantile empire fought for its very survival against the romans and how it ultimately fell beneath the talons of the roman eagle i'm incredibly excited to say that this video is sponsored by total war rome remastered i was given this game a few weeks before release to record a little bit of gameplay footage and accidentally sunk 40 hours into forming an empire and marching on the city of rome the original total war roam was probably one of my favorite games as a kid and though i was hesitant about this remaster at first the people at feral interactive in my opinion did a fantastic job in bringing this classic title to the modern age while still keeping its feel the same rome remastered has got updated 4k visuals extensive gameplay improvements many of which are actually toggleable if you prefer the original systems as well as much needed performance optimization multiplayer is up and working and 16 previously unplayable factions have been added to the grand campaign the barbarian invasion and alexander expansions are also included too making it super replayable and speaking of replayability there is steam workshop for this game and the modding tools are fantastic i genuinely recommend picking up this remaster if you enjoy history and strategy games and you can support our channel in the process by using the link in the description below [Music] by the 3rd century bc carthage had grown into a true power of the mediterranean the carthaginians shunned absolute rulers in favor of a republic placing administrative authority into the hands of a soffit elected annually by a senatorial body consisting of the richest families in the city family lineage played no part in carthaginian politics power came from wealth and wealth flowed in from overseas trade carthage steadily expanded its mercantile influence across northern africa and out into the mediterranean establishing prosperous colonies in iberia sicily sardinia and corsica meanwhile the disparate peoples of the italian peninsula were being steadily united under one batter the roman eagle at first relations between the two powers were amicable allowing the carthaginians to open mutually beneficial trade routes this amenity was shattered when the city-state of messini approached both the romans and carthaginians offering up its fealty in exchange for protection from invasion roman and carthaginian detachments were sent to masini but the punic forces arrived first hastily securing the citadel but when the inhabitants of messini heard that the romans were drawing near they very politely asked the carthaginians to get the hell out the freshly evicted carthaginians could only watch as the romans marched into masini stealing what was briefly their holding outraged the carthaginians turned around and laid siege to the city alongside messini's rival city-state of syracuse the first punic war had begun it wasn't long before the romans took the initiative sallying forth to defeat the besiegers in detail first luring in the syracusan forces then after defeating them dealing with the carthaginians alone after hiring mercenaries to replace their syracusan allies who swiftly made peace with rome the carthaginians moved their regular forces to acrogas to consolidate with their hired help the romans laid siege to acrogas and bottled up the carthaginian regulars the trapped soldiers under a general named hannibal wait no not that one that one sallied forth to break the siege and carthage sent their newly hired mercenaries to assist it did not go well the war in sicily ground to a stalemate with carthage waging a guerrilla war from their remaining strongholds as the romans consolidated control of the island desperate to challenge carthage on all fronts the latin supposedly copied the design of a wrecked punic ship and built an entire fleet to rest control of the seas from their opponents the two fleets met at maile and using their tried and true tactic of closing distance to ram their foes and split their ships to splinters the punic fleet were confident that their numbers would carry the day but the roman ships dropped spiked bridges from their prows the moment their foes were in ramming range locking the carthaginians in place and allowing marines to board using clever engineering the romans turned to naval combat at which they had no experience into land combat at which they were experts the romans followed up miley with a stunning victory at cape egnomos paving the way for an invasion of north africa fearing that the romans would head straight for the capital punic forces frantically prepared their defenses only to find they wouldn't be needed the romans landed elsewhere in tunisia and a hastily assembled force of spartan mercenaries met them in the field but for the romans it did not go well other skirmishes on the african coast and storms in the straits of sicily kept the romans away from carthage and forced the war into a stalemate and so carthage ruled the waves and rome ruled sicily at this point rome and carthage had been at each other's throats for almost 20 years the romans took advantage of the quiet to build a third and final fleet with which they smashed the carthaginians at the battle of agates islands before blockading the surviving carthaginians in sicily cut off from all supply the carthaginians were forced to submit the first punic war was over carthage emerged from the war facing challenges internal and external the war had been extensively financed by the efforts of hano the great an immensely powerful and influential carthaginian senator who had personally conquered large swathes of african territory in 241 bc a full-scale mutiny broke out amongst carthage's mercenaries which grew into a general revolt hanno raised a force to defend the capital a task he barely succeeded at as the situation steadily worsened the senate was forced to beg rome for assistance remarkably rome obliged sending large shipments of grain to feed the populace and even releasing thousands of prisoners from their previous war these men were quickly snapped up by hamilkar barka a popular commander in the guerrilla campaigns in sicily and the father of hannibal yes that one hamilkar set out on his own campaign against the rebels in 240 bc chalking up a string of victories and humiliating hano while the two carthaginian generals were busy fighting in africa the revolt spread to the garrisons of sardinia and corsica and rome took advantage of the mayhem to seize the islands carthage objected but rome insisted so carthage backed down as tension built a second war was inevitable but carthage wanted time to prepare to hamilkar barka this concession was a blatant act of betrayal he had staked both his family fortune and military reputation on the outcome of the first punic war pano however was quick to point out that hamilkar was in large part responsible for the truceless war having sent his mercenaries home to africa after promising them lavish bonuses that the senate and carthage had never actually agreed to hamilkar struck back decrying the senate as nothing more than a collection of rich merchants who had grown fat and lazy while his men suffered and died in the fields and waters around sicily the carthaginian popular assembly rallied behind hamilkar having come to regard him as a savior who stood against the corruption of the senate leveraging the wounded pride of his countrymen to its fullest extent hamilkar declared that he would take his army west and conquer iberia securing the natural riches of the land to both pay off carthaginian war debt and prepare the nation for what he saw as an inevitable second conflict with the treacherous romans faced with civil war if they refused hano and his allies gave their begrudging consent and hamilkar immediately set out on his new expedition he would never return [Music] prior to abandoning his home hamilkar had made lavish sacrifices to the carthaginian gods during these ceremonies his son hannibal swore a binding oath to never be a friend of rome for nearly a decade hamilkar led his private army to war with the tribes of iberia securing access to the large silver and gold mines in the sierra mornea mountain range and linking them directly to the coast via inland waterways hamilkar quickly became one of the richest men in ancient history but although the gods seemed to have blessed his endeavors he would not live long enough to do more than build the foundations for a new war against rome at some point during 228 bc the great general was killed in combat leaving his sons in charge of both the army and the enormous wealth he had accrued fortunately for the late hamilkar the bar sid family he left behind was more capable of living up to his legacy his sons hannibal and hazdrubal were now teenagers and had already demonstrated talent equal to their father hamilkar's army was both loyal and confident consisting of hardened veterans who had fought and bled with the family since the days of the first punic war for the next ten years the bar said brothers worked with their uncle to secure and expand their control over iberia but this was a preamble to greater plans in 218 bc hannibal attacked the roman allied city of seguntum in response to this sudden aggression the romans sent an envoy to the carthaginians demanding that the son of hamilkar be turned over to them for execution but the envoy found himself confronted by a hostile carthaginian senate and a popular assembly that stood united with the mighty barsid family in a dramatic confrontation the envoy declared before the senate that he carried within his toga both war and peace the carthaginians could choose what they preferred the story goes that with one voice the senate roared back their response war having secured the backing of the senate hannibal traveled to the city of new carthage to assemble his army after entrusting his brother has drubal with about 13 000 men to defend iberia hannibal took a vast number of infantrymen and cavalry along with 37 war elephants and marched north in late june he easily crossed the pyrenees into gaul taking an indirect route to avoid rome's allies in the region even so hannibal encountered resistance at the rhone river when a gallic tribe known as the aloproge formed up on the opposite bank to block his advance thinking quickly hannibal sent a division north to ford the river and outflank the entrenched barbarians then rushed across while they were distracted the gauls dispersed leaving the road clear to the alps hannibal arrived at the foot of the mountains as soon as he began his ascent problems began after fighting off an aloe broge ambush in the mountain pass hannibal encountered a local tribe offering to act as guides trusting them nearly proved a fatal mistake as the carthaginians were led to the edge of a deep ravine and a second ambush barely driving off the treacherous gauls hannibal's army was finally able to rest in the shelter provided by a large white rock formation hannibal encouraged his men to go forward and the exhausted carthaginians began their descent after 15 days in the mountains and five months on the march since leaving new carthage 26 000 exhausted bedraggled men stumbled out of the alps and onto the fertile italian plains despite losing nearly half of his army and most of his elephants hannibal had accomplished something previously thought impossible and his enemies were completely ignorant of the danger that had just arrived on their doorstep his first encounter with rome occurred in late november in the poe valley where his numidian horsemen decisively routed the roman equitas hannibal pursued his foes to their camp on the river tribia where he caught them fording the icy river rome's superior numbers were worth little against carthaginian attacks along the roman flank led by hannibal's younger brother mago within hours the 40 000 legionaries were surrounded with thirty thousand killed or captured as hannibal's men plundered their camp for supplies hannibal wasted no time pressing deeper into italy in preparing for an ambush along lake trazamine the punic army detoured through a swamp where hannibal tore his own eye out to avoid dying from an infection it was worth the cost as the pursuing romans marched straight into hannibal's position [Applause] the roman general was killed in the opening minutes of the battle and to be drowned and captured numbered in the tens of thousands following his two great victories hannibal opened negotiations with rome's allies he made a point of releasing many of his captives only keeping the prisoners from the city of rome hannibal defended this policy by stating i did not come to fight against italians but on behalf of italians against rome hannibal bore this mantra out by focusing his pillage exclusively on the estates of wealthy roman nobles hoping to inflict as much damage on the roman economy as possible in mid 216 bc after months of intermittent skirmishes hannibal received word that a gigantic army of over 80 000 roman soldiers was marching straight toward him although outnumbered almost two to one the great general quickly realized that this was his chance and marched his fifty thousand man army to canai the roman army was under the joint command of generals paulus and varro hannibal knew his opponents well paulus was a cautious general while to hannibal vara was a glory hungry idiot and his chosen mark due to their equal rank palus and varro commanded the army on alternating days so hannibal simply waited until it was varro's turn to make his move when the roman formation charged the carthaginians hannibal was there in the middle of his troops mounted on one of his only remaining war elephants however the punic frontline seemed to break before varro's expert application of brute force as the forward most carthaginian units caved into an inverted crescent the tightly packed legionaries pressed on breaking formation as they made contact and gave hannibal his chance elite punic infantry swept in from all sides closing the crescent while the famed numidian cavalry cut off any routes of escape from the field though smaller in number the carthaginians had encircled the mighty romans trapping them like cattle in a slaughterhouse over half of the legionaries were sent to meet mithras having just won a battle that generals and youtube historians alike would analyze for generations hannibal watched with smug satisfaction as rome's allies in southern italy and syracuse defected on mass then dire news arrived while hannibal had been busy in italy a small roman force had arrived in iberia and his brother has drubal was now on the defensive just as the barcids had taken matters into their own hands following the first punic war a roman family known as the scipiones had taken charge of rome's overseas war efforts and their armies were now deep in barcelona territory denying hannibal any chance of easy reinforcement old supporters of hanoi the great had reasserted themselves in the carthaginian senate and were deliberately obstructing any efforts to send hannibal troops and equipment effectively trapped in italy and burdened by the responsibility of defending his new italian allies hannibal rampaged up and down the peninsula for nine years but his enemies had learned the lessons of kanai well and hannibal failed to draw rome into a decisive engagement meanwhile has drubal was pushed back further and further until he opted to abandon these spanish provinces entirely and take a 30 000 man army to join his brother in italia in 207 bc it was at this point when things began to collapse when has drubal was intercepted near the metaroos river where hazrubal was killed and his entire army destroyed then the roman soldiers reconquered sicily granting rome a springboard into north africa and cutting off hannibal's army by land and sea soon hannibal was ordered to pull his forces back to carthage all of his gains evaporated as his ship left the peninsula he still hoped to stall rome long enough for them to sue for peace but by the time he reached carthage the city had already surrendered to the romans the barcid's rivals had negotiated a peace with pablius cornelius scipio commander of the roman force in africa hannibal and scipio had met in battle before at the river taquinos when scipio was only 16 and the teenager had saved his father from capture at the hands of the carthaginian army hannibal was disgusted with the senate's naked submission just like his father hamilkar he had shed blood for carthage his entire adult life only to be betrayed and discarded at the last minute yet with his arrival in africa the old supporters of the bar said family emerged from hiding and wrestled control of the senate away from the psychophantic merchants who were ready to give up with their will to resist rekindled hannibal raised a citizen army and hired fresh mercenaries from all across africa then knowing that this would be his last roll of the dice the grizzled one-eyed 45-year-old carthaginian general marched out to confront his 33 year old roman counterpart in a battle that would decide the fate of his nation two empires would enter but just one would leave the final battle of the second punic war took place in october 202 bc on the open plains of zama scipio knew this was the best terrain for cavalry and secured numidian allies of his own he entered the battle with a third more cavalry than hannibal and was accompanied by a veteran force of legionaries meanwhile the bulk of hannibal's forces were citizen militia and local levees but hannibal had 80 war elephants deployed at the front of his line aimed like living battering rams towards the roman center before hostilities commenced hannibal and scipio met in the field their conversation was brief a chance to size up the opposition perhaps under different circumstances they could have called each other friends hannibal gave a pre-battle speech to his elites congratulating them on the great victories they had shared in the past he reminded his levies of their duties and what was at stake if they lost finally he ordered his elephants to charge unlike his forebears scipio had a counter for hannibal's beasts the romans used trumpets and simples to startle the elephants all while his cohorts were spread in such a way that the elephants had open avenues to charge down and away from the clatter and as they passed through these funnels they were pelted with projectiles and killed scipio's forces then drove hannibal's cavalry from the field depriving him of a crucial component of his army once the architect of so many victories through strength and speed of his cavalry hannibal watched in horror as his own tactics were employed against him once rome's numidian allies wheeled around and charged the carthaginian flanks the battle was over and rome treated hannibal to a re-enactment of cannae from their perspective with no options left and roam at the gates of the capital the senate opted to surrender the romans were not kind to their conquered foes carthage was stripped of all of its overseas territory and saddled with crippling reparations most outrageous of all the peace treaty stipulated that carthage could not go to war without rome's permission humiliated and subdued carthage entered a period of uneasy peace all the while feeling rome's heavy blade hanging over their heads the great hannibal became a political leader enacting many sweeping reforms to help restore carthage's glory but years later the romans possibly afraid of his continued influence accused their old foe of conspiring with rome's enemies and forced him into exile hannibal would die in exile his dreams of carthaginian dominance unrealized over 50 years after their devastating defeat carthage was beginning to rise from the ashes however they were continually plagued by raids from their southern neighbor numidian king massanesa masanesa was an ally of rome and every time carthage requested permission to defend their land the romans refused in the year 151 the carthaginian senate raised an army to stop the numidian raiders treaty be damned unexpectedly the punic army was defeated by the numidians and then the carthaginians were forced to watch from behind their walls as the romans mobilized against them the romans arrived at the nearby city of utica with a massive army and demanded that the carthaginians turn over all of their military equipment immediately the senate complied turning over all of their arms and allowing their fleet to be burned at anchor with carthage stripped of its defenses the romans made their next demand the carthaginians must abandon their city so that the romans could raise it desperate though they were the proud citizens of carthage could not accept this their delegation quickly returned to the city recruiting and arming an army for one last hopeless battle at the nearby town of nepherus there the romans defeated the carthaginians and proceeded to lay siege to their capital the carthaginians endured the siege for three years before the romans breached the walls they roamed the streets for six days killing and burning before the survivors finally surrendered to spare the lives of their families around 50 000 hostages were taken to be sold into slavery and they alone lived to witness the final fate of their city carthage was pulled down brick by brick its territory annexed directly into the roman republic the proud elephant of north africa was feasted on by a swarm of roman eagles [Music] in just over a century the republic of carthage was reduced from a large wealthy nation with near-total dominance over the western mediterranean to a smoldering ruin and a ghost of an empire but even this was not the end of carthage a century after its fall julius caesar ordered the city to be rebuilt the nascent city quickly regrew and by the first century a.d it was the second largest city in the western mediterranean even long after mighty rome had snuffed out

       " \" hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian the murder of archduke franz ferdinand and his wife sophie at the hands of gavrilo princep is widely considered the inciting incident of the first world war but while austria-hungary is depicted as a lead player in the prologue to the conflict popular understanding paints them as a junior partner to the german empire once the conflict begins akin to mussolini's fascist italy 20 years on in reality austria-hungary was an active participant in the conflict fighting brutal engagements against the russian empire on the eastern front

for channel viewers at the end of this video the shooting of the heir to the austro-hungarian throne and his wife by the serbs a people the archduke had spent much of his political career trying to peacefully integrate into the wider empire sent shockwaves through the austrian court franz ferdinand was a proponent of reorganizing the austro-hungarian empire creating a union of ethnic states that would grant the many peoples of the empire more autonomy and a greater sense of linguistic and ethnic identity a plan that ferdinand's death permanently derailed and in the aftermath the war hungary in vienna made their move conrad von hutzendorf chief of staff of the austro-hungarian army and navy maintained that austria-hungary had a stain on their military record after their humiliating defeat in 1866 against the prussians at koenig greats only military victory would redeem the empire in conrad's mind and he pushed for a war of retribution with serbia to bring this absolution emperor franz joseph of austria-hungary assented to conrad's warmongering in the wake of his nephew's murder believing that the survival of the habsburg monarchy was at stake the austro-hungarians sent a laundry list of outrageous demands to the serbian government implicating them in the assassination and outlining a list of ways to make recompense that would certainly be rejected just as austria-hungary wanted but serbia took the austro-hungarians off guard by agreeing to a majority of their demands and formally requesting international arbitration to discuss the few stipulations that they held issue with undeterred by this sudden display of reason the austro-hungarians remained determined to go to war serbia broke off negotiations on july 25th and so the austro-hungarians cheerfully declared war on the 28th and celebrated the upcoming conflict by shelling belgrade that same day but for all her bluster and bloodlust austria-hungary was not a nation ready for war the empire fielded three vastly different armies during the war the land there from austria the honvaid from hungary and the common or imperial and royal army the third army was an ill-equipped and ethnically diverse force with its core units of conscripts consisting of czechs slovaks hungarians and other groups with differing languages and customs but this diversity posed unique challenges for every 1 000 soldiers under the austro-hungarian banner 267 spoke german 223 spoke the magyar language of hungary 135 spoke czech 85 spoke polish 81 ukrainian 67 bosnian croatian montenegrin serbian 64 romanian 38 slovak 26 slovene and finally 18 soldiers spoke italian their austrian leadership spoke german exclusively creating inherent communications difficulties throughout the war but all the men in the world whether they can communicate or not can do little without proper arms and equipment most of the empire's artillery had not been updated since 1899 and bureaucrats within the imperial court had long prevented the allocation of funds to modernize and expand the armed forces this stagnation can be readily seen in austria's two abortive flirtations with armored warfare in 1905 a prototype armored car was demonstrated for the general staff only for the project to be cancelled by emperor franz joseph after the machine spooked his horse in 1911 inventor gunther burstin approached the general staff with a tank design far in advance of the british mark 1 a machine the austrians were happy to adopt if bursting would cover all of the production costs himself despite these military deficiencies the austro-hungarian empire pursued its goal of domination over serbia with zeal the german empire threw their law in with austria-hungary after the declaration of war militarily underwriting the empire's balkan adventure through the infamous blank check this support from the germans led emperor franz joseph to remark now we can no longer hold back it will be a terrible war britain and france declared war on germany after german troops entered belgium while italy swore neutrality in the conflict for now with her western border secured by the german empire austria-hungary was left with only serbia and her russian defender to deal with the austrians launched their first defensive against serbia in august 1914 and were able to take some serbian territory for 13 days the stinginess of the empire's bureaucrats reared its head and the soldiers on the ground were forced to fight with antiquated rifles and little ammunition despite their logistical shortcomings the austro-hungarians were able to enact a campaign of terror in their briefly held territory enacting brutal reprisals on resistant serbian civilians austria's tactics proved to be a serious shortcoming for their initial invasion of serbia the goal was to wage a conflict constantly on the move pressing forward and engaging the enemy line or attacking enemy fortifications reconnaissance was left to the austrian cavalry who were to simultaneously screen the advance reconnoiter and serve as messengers and orderlies for command detachments the result of this was infantry marching into unknown territory under the impression that cavalry had scouted ahead however the cavalry had no time to actually mount their reconnaissance missions and as for the artillery they didn't communicate with either of them in november the austrians launched a second invasion that broke through to belgrade before being turned back by serbian forces a serb counter-attack caught the austro-hungarians in the middle of a military parade through the city and austrian artillery was stationed too far from the front to break up the serbian advance the two sides met in battle at the kalubara river where the serbians handed the austrians a decisive defeat the third time proved to be the charm for austria-hungary in october 1915 a combined offensive by the austrians germans and bulgarians overran serbian defenses and drove deep into the country for the serbs part they had been promised significant aid from the british and french including additional troops which had failed to materialize and this lack of support meant that they could do little in the face of three armies at once the serbian government was driven from the country by the combined offensive and austria-hungary occupied the entirety of serbia and declared total victory austria-hungary would have a harder time on the eastern front against the russian empire they began the war defensively unsuccessfully attempting to turn back a russian invasion of the galicia region an early defeat at tanenburg in the summer of 1914 nearly led to the annihilation of russia's forces but the russians were able to recover by the year's end and put the austrians to route 1915 saw the germans and austro-hungarians recover territory and establish a defensive line running from riga to tarnopol a line that they would hold until the collapse of the russian empire in 1917 saved for an incursion by the russians during the brucilla offensive which resulted in anywhere from six hundred thousand to nine hundred thousand austro-hungarian casualties finally the entry of italy into the war on the side of the ontant in 1915 forced the austrians to withdraw their troops from the southern portion of the eastern front what austro-hungarian forces were left attempted along with their german allies to turn back the aforementioned brazilian offensive that same year which proved to be a much needed success for these artists and motivated romania to join the war on the russian side this would prove romania's undoing as the 1916 romanian offensive into austro-hungarian territory drew the attention of every nation opposed to them a combined force of austro-hungarian german bulgarian and even turkish troops invaded romania from all sides not so much defeating as annihilating them the central powers were able to divide up romania's oil and grain stocks amongst themselves giving the germans and austro-hungarians a desperately needed boost to their flagging wartime economies the russians would spend the rest of the war on the back foot and the russian revolution brought these soviets into power ending the war in the east the final theater austria-hungary was involved in was the italian front italy reconsidered her neutrality in 1915 motivated by a border dispute with austria dating back to 1815 and overtures made by britain and france including promises of territory upon their victory over germany and austria-hungary the italians began the war with a three-to-one numerical advantage but this leg up was countered by the austro-hungarian's geographical advantage the austro-hungarian's positions along the alps and the karst plateau forced the invaders into a literal uphill battle the italians launched attack after attack winning little in terms of territory or initiative but succeeding in sapping austrian resources by 1917 the germans were able to reinforce their austro-hungarian allies and the two launched an offensive beginning the battle of caporeto the germanic armies pushed the italians back over 19 kilometers or roughly 12 miles but were stopped short after they exceeded their supply lines it was on the italian front that the bold austro-hungarian navy saw most of its combat the empire's adriatic fleet spent the first year of the war bombarding serbian and montenegrin positions it was not until italy's declaration of war that the austrians saw naval combat in earnest and they continued their successful strategy of shooting at people who can't shoot back along the italian coast austro-hungarian ships would see little other action for the rest of the war the italian front reached its climax in 1918 when the austrians attempted one last major push they were stopped by italian forces at the piave river where information fed to the italians by austrian deserters allowed them to array their forces in a perfect counter to the austrian attack there was little need for it however as by this point the austro-hungarian empire was tearing itself apart the italians just had to dig in and watch their opponent disintegrate after the death of the austro-hungarian emperor in 1916 the successor carl the first enlisted his brother-in-law sixtus to meet with the french as an officer in the belgian army sixtists could make contact with french officials without arousing suspicion sixtus embarked on his mission in 1917 shortly before the collapse of the russian empire he returned to carl with terms the return of alsace lorraine to france the restoration of belgian independence the grant of independence to serbia and the annexation of constantinople by the russian empire carl agreed to all of these concessions in a letter written to the french prime minister but when the russian empire left the war the austrian foreign minister made a fiery speech denouncing the french as an obstacle to peace across europe france responded by publishing carl's letter a possible german occupation of austria was only stopped by carl sending the kaiser his word of honor that sikdes had completely acted independently and that the letter was not an accurate representation of his wishes the austro-hungarian empire entered its final collapse in the summer of 1918. her armies completely defeated and racked with ethnic strife and insubordination her population utterly fatigued and battling malnutrition and disease infrastructure rotting away due to neglect and the stresses of war the dual monarchy was poised for

       " \" hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian in 1805 napoleon bonaparte delivered a coup de grace to the holy roman empire at the battle of austerlitz where the combined forces of russia and austria were decisively defeated by his smaller army this victory established the french empire as the dominant military power of the continent pioneering new innovations in infantry tactics and artillery that left the rest of europe in the dust napoleon swiftly reorganized the shattered remnants of the holy roman empire into a french vassal and turned his attention to larger matters in the end it took the nations of europe 23 years and seven coalitions to bring revolutionary france down in 1815 however within a generation a second french empire was founded by napoleon's nephew but in contrast to his uncle's military success napoleon iii's empire was dismantled in a little over six weeks against a revitalized confederation of german states who proceeded to bombard their way to the gates of paris it can be argued that the prussian leadership carried the legacy of french military innovation seen in the napoleonic wars better than the french themselves in the franco-prussian war of 1871 as the battle that would bring the second empire down was won primarily by skillful maneuvering and masked artillery something napoleon the first was known for this incompetence surely left napoleon the first's tailcoated corpse spinning in his grave who once quoted god fights on the side with the best artillery in this video we'll see exactly how this conflict played out and how the

saw a david and goliath struggle between the kingdom of prussia and the empire of austria for control over the german-speaking states which resulted in a clear victory for prussia and the formation of the north german confederation legendary prussian statesman otto von bismarck was chiefly responsible for this conflict having carefully manipulated events to ensure that his modern prosperous state took the lead in german affairs instead of the ethnically divided and militarily outmoded austria but prussia's sudden return to international prominence did not go unnoticed by its perennial adversary france emperor shala luis napoleon iii was constantly trying to emulate the deeds of his more famous uncle and had even timed his coup against the former republican government to coincide with the storied victory at austerlitz seeing prussia's rapid expansion as a threat to the balance of power in europe napoleon iii's cabinet ministers urged him to demand territorial concessions along the west bank of the orion to fortify france's eastern border this was precisely what bismarck wanted a number of german states had yet to join the nascent north german confederation and bismarck believed that a war with france would be necessary to coax them into the fold and complete the unification of germany bismarck rejected napoleon iii's demands out of hand and the french emperor proved all too eager to walk straight into bismarck's traps in 1870 the manufactured threat of a spanish prussian alliance was enough to spark a full-scale conflict between the two belligerent nations the stage was set for a war that would redefine the political balance of europe the french and german militaries represented some of the best soldiers on the continent both of which had recent victories the former against russia and austria and the latter against austria and denmark the french army was a professional organization that employed selective conscription for long service periods with benefits offered to those choosing to re-enlist meanwhile the german military was built upon the foundation of universal conscription for a much shorter service period as was common at the time both nations only kept a fraction of their men under arms during peace relying on their trained reserves to quickly fill the ranks when war broke out under the french system this allowed for a reserve of around 400 000 professional soldiers while the germans could call upon a veritable human ocean of over a million conscripts the key of course was getting all of them armed and shipped to the front lines in an orderly fashion from the outset both sides knew that early action would prove decisive under pressure from his military planners to strike before the germanic horde could assemble napoleon left paris on the 28th of july 1870 to command the army of the rhine which marched east to invade germany and liberate the southern states from prussian oppression of course this again played directly into bismarck's hands as the southern states had declared themselves for prussia the moment they had received word of french mobilization but such details would be irrelevant if the north german confederation failed to secure victory the opening shots of the war were fired on the 2nd of august when the french second corps under the command of general shala fossa crossed the border and attacked the town of zarbrucken which his scouts had informed him was defended only by a single isolated regiment fersaw had good reason to be confident as his troops were armed with breech-loading bolt-action shaspo rifles the germans on the other hand used the drysa needle rifle a decades older and less effective model than the shaspo in these skirmishes that followed the french rifle proved itself a far superior weapon in most respects especially in terms of accuracy at long range the french also deployed the terrifying mitraeus a multi-barreled volley gun capable of firing up to 125 high caliber rounds a minute thanks to these advantages the second core easily captured the town despite stiff resistance emboldened by this early success napoleon iii was eager to continue the offensive only to be stunned by reports of a german army advancing south across the border towards the town of vissenborg which was defended by the five thousand men of the french first corps under general abel dui despite being horribly outnumbered the first corps fought bravely using their compliment of mitriu's guns to carve bloody swathes in the ranks of the attackers but when german artillery fire killed general douwe the terrified civilians threw open the gates and hoisted a white flag of surrender but the french soldiers fought on firing from rooftops onto the horde of german soldiers pouring into the town this bloody house-to-house fighting continued until german artillery closed to point-blank range threatening to annihilate the remaining defenders only then did the first corps surrender in response to this shocking turn of events napoleon hurriedly entrusted marshall patrice mcmull with command of his three southernmost army corps and dispatched them to engage the germans as they advanced deeper into french territory but unbeknownst to napoleon this was only one of three german armies that had been assembled at the border since mid-july this feat of military logistics was all thanks to field marshal helmut von moltka widely regarded as the finest military mind of his generation since the early 1860s german general staff officers had been traveling throughout france surveying terrain creating excellent maps some of which rivaled french-made maps of their own country and calculating the available food supplies of every fortress and town in the northeastern part of the country allowing malta to rush his reserves to the border far faster than the french had ever anticipated ignorant of these facts mcmahon's 45 000 men marched southeast taking up defensive positions on a heavily wooded ridge line near the town of vert which provided clear lines of fire across the open fields beyond as the germans marched forward they were subjected to a withering barrage of the morale-crushing use guns while shaspo rifles dealt most of the real damage picking off stragglers at ranges that the needle rifle simply could not match but while the french held the line against the enemy infantry they found themselves at the mercy of german artillery to his horror makmol realized that the supposedly invincible french artillery corps was completely outclassed by the new crop designed canon which employed state of the art fuses and breach loading mechanisms to fire faster and more accurately than the french muzzleloaders in the face of incessant barrages the french were forced to flee the field having suffered nearly 20 000 casualties in a matter of hours further west things have been going just as badly for the french second corps on the same day mac maorn engaged the prussian third army near vert general forsa was in a pitched battle with the first and second prussian armies near spiciarin soon after the action commenced furson noticed that his positions were being quickly surrounded and overwhelmed this was a result of german infantry tactics which favored independent platoons attacking from multiple directions the french hoped to counter this with tight defensive formations and massed firepower but these were vulnerable to being encircled by the much better coordinated german units although he recognized this issue all of frassa's efforts to coordinate his troops and request reinforcements were frustrated by poor lines of communication and by evening he was forced to order a withdrawal to the south when the news of these twin disasters reached his ears a shell-shocked napoleon iii ordered the army of the rhine into an unceremonious retreat to mess abandoning most of eastern france to german occupation with his dreams of glory shattered the distraught emperor begrudgingly yielded command of his remaining forces to marshal francois ashil bazan who promptly began bickering with the rest of the general staff over what to do next this resulted in the french taking over a week to cross the river moselle giving the germans numerous opportunities to delay them further in fact the french retreated even slower than the germans had calculated and when thirty thousand men of the prussian second army were sent to harass the french rear guard near the village of maz latur they instead found themselves confronted by an entire enemy army [Music] this unexpected turn of events should have resulted in a decisive victory for bazina and the brave marshal demonstrated his valor by throwing himself into the center of the action unfortunately this isolated him from the chain of command leaving the other french officers involved in the battle to act on their own initiative something they were completely unprepared for [Music] sensing chaos among the enemy ranks the outnumbered germans took the offensive culminating in a reckless charge by two heavy cavalry regiments against the french artillery positions this act of suicidal bravery later dubbed the death ride cost half of the 800 horsemen their lives but successfully silenced the french guns left unsupported the french infantry were unable to break the thin german lines which held despite being outnumbered almost four to one by the late afternoon german reinforcements began to flow into the area and the zane was forced with the horrible revelation that his men were simply too exhausted to continue trying to break out to the west left with no choice he ordered a retreat back to mess hoping to at least rest and resupply after the near disaster at maas le tour multiga opted for caution while the third army continued its pursuit of makmal in the south multica ordered the second army to advance toward the french positions on the moselle and the village of gravlot the two forces engaged shortly before noon on august 18th with the french choosing to dig in and hold fast to their defensive lines as in previous battles many german attacks stalled in the face of superior french firepower but prussia dominated the artillery duel with over 200 cannon laying waste to enemy positions and causing a mass route at the village of sanpriva seeing disaster looming french general shala bubaki led the famed imperial guard to reinforce the line but upon seeing his allies already fleeing bubaki halted the advance reportedly protesting you promised me victory now you get me involved in a route when the rest of the french saw the imperial guard preparing to withdraw their morale collapsed and the entire army retreated in disarray behind the fortifications of mess where it was promptly encircled and besieged despite suffering over 20 000 casualties compared to the french count of 12 000 the battle of gravlot was a decisive victory for the germans the very next day multica began enacting the next stage of his plan german losses had been heavy and general steinmetz of the prussian first army had failed to trap the french second core at speecherin so with the stroke of a pen multiga replaced him such a casual dismissal of a high-ranking officer would have been unthinkable in the french army which had been suffering a critical shortage of competent officers and was often crippled by favoritism and petty rivalries meanwhile what was left of the second army was reconstituted into a new fourth army which was sent marching west to link up with the third army and attack marshall mcmull who was rallying his forces at shalom by this point it had become clear to everyone in the french army that napoleon iii was gravely ill the 61 year old emperor had long suffered from numerous health conditions but these had been kept a state secret but now his troops could watch him hobbling about the camp in constant agony from a combination of advanced arthritis and gallstones in a way his condition mirrored the state of the french army whose own weaknesses had been so starkly revealed in the recent battles the selective conscription system had allowed any man with money to buy his way out of service leaving nothing but the poorest illiterate dregs to fill the ranks the few career soldiers remaining were either too old to be effective or had fallen victim to the rampant alcoholism that had plagued the military for years but although he was completely outnumbered mcmahon had to act it was imperative mess be relieved no matter the cost thus he drove his 120 000 exhausted feckless soldiers into march on august 21st to the aid of bazina doing his best to march along a course that would avoid contact with the prussian armies but mcmull's efforts were doomed and he was unable to do anything to prevent his force from being quickly spotted and shadowed by german cavalry patrols which reported their location straight back to multica upon learning of this threat multicast simply ordered the third and fourth armies to catch the much smaller french force in a pincer move when he realized he was being pursued mcmahon deployed his men in a defensive triangle near the obsolete 17th century fortress of sedong with the river and fortifications at his back summing up the situation one of his subordinates famously remarked we are in a chamber pot about to be on interestingly the first ever photograph of active combat in history was taken during this battle as a photographer stood on a grassy hill overlooking the countryside with the french defenders on september 1st the battle of saddam began the first shots were fired in the outlying village of basea where bavarian troops encountered a motley collection of french soldiers a contingent of marines diverted from the baltic and armed civilians all firing at them from rooftops doorways trees and church steeples caught by surprise the bavarians were forced to commit to brutal house-to-house fighting that continued well into the afternoon but while the outnumbered defenders of bizea continued to hold out the rest of the prussian army continued to methodically encircle saddam pushing the french back from their defensive positions and destroying any isolated units with concentrated artillery fire marshall mcmahon continued trying to rally his men and stage a breakout at la mocelle but he was abruptly wounded in the fighting and had to withdraw from the battlefield this led to a dispute in the chain of command as when mcmahon's designated successor ordered a retreat he was overruled by another general who had only just arrived from paris under orders from the french minister of war with no way to establish a clear chain of command the army dithered losing all sense of direction by the late afternoon the village of isaiah was finally taken by the bavarians who sustained nearly 4 000 casualties in the battle with their southern positions now completely overrun and the prussian army crossing the river moselle to the west the french were slowly hemmed in on all sides and forced to retreat behind the walls of saddam but the french were not even afforded the dignity of a glorious last stand as instead of assaulting the walls the germans instead lined up over 400 guns on the heights outside the town and commenced a devastating bombardment as the day wore on emperor napoleon iii began riding aimlessly back and forth among his troops despondently hoping that a german shell would end his misery meanwhile the french cavalry desperately tried to break out through enemy lines but their charges were all repelled each time despite suffering heavy losses the cavalry reformed and charged again prompting king wilhelm to exclaim ah those brave men at around 5 pm napoleon finally realized that god had no intention of letting him commit suicide by artillery shell and raised a white flag over the citadel by this late hour the french army had been all but annihilated as a fighting force having lost all cohesion thanks to the merciless shelling that made any kind of counter-attack or breakout and impossibility upon seeing that their thoroughly beaten enemy was finally surrendering a prussian representative was detached to meet with the emperor and then returned to king wilhelm bearing a message having been unable to die in the midst of my troops there remains nothing for me but to deliver my sword into your majesty's hands i am your majesty's true brother napoleon as a heavy rainfall began what remained of the french army marched out of their shattered fortress into captivity of the 124 000 that had begun the battle 17 000 had been killed or wounded a further 21 000 had been taken prisoner during the fighting leaving only 83 000 to surrender along with their emperor a mere 3000 had escaped to the north fleeing to belgium where they were promptly detained and disarmed rarely in french history had a defeat been so utter and complete much less one fought on their home soil the defeat of macmol and the capture of the emperor and the loss of his entire army in the span of a single day was the death sentence for the second french empire at this point napoleon iii was deeply unpopular with many of his subjects and the moment word of his capture reached paris an angry mob rose up and overthrew his government declaring the beginning of the third republic but despite the head of the new government general louis choshu boldly proclaiming that he would seed not an inch of our soil or a stone of our fortress the reality was that france no longer had a strong enough army in the field it was no longer a matter of if france would cede soil and stone but how much yet as they marched toward the capital the german armies found themselves being constantly harassed by french partisans these were the frontier or free shooters a militia force made up primarily from members of the pre-war french shooting clubs in the end their valiant efforts delayed the german advance long enough for an army of more than four hundred thousand men to assemble for the defense of paris sadly the majority were members of the paris national guard which was barely more than a ragtag group of angry political dissidents only around 60 000 were actual soldiers with another 100 thousand being part of the guard mobile which consisted of men who had paid their way out of conscription into the regular army when the germans reached paris on the 17th of september they effortlessly turned back a poorly organized sortie by the defenders and had the city completely encircled within 24 hours during this initial conflict the imperial palace at versailles was captured becoming the headquarters of the besieging army all the way back at mass marshal bazane and his men had been incredibly busy starving to death the german siege lines were unbreakable and on october 27th bezain finally surrendered his entire force of 133 thousand into captivity the only real french victory of the war occurred on november 9th when seventy thousand troops from the newly raised army of loire routed twenty thousand bavarians and liberated the city of orleon this inspired the defenders of paris to keep fighting despite the overwhelming odds stacked against them and even a days-long bombardment by german field artillery failed to break their spirits but even as the citizen army continued to hold out king wilhelm the first staged a grand coronation at the captured palace of versailles on january 18th this was the culmination of his and bismarck's imperial ambitions and had been directly enabled by the very french invasion that had scared the southern german states into joining the confederation a week later bismarck demanded that the bombardment of paris be intensified and despite multicast objections the new kaiser granted his request a battery of powerful corrupt siege guns was set up outside the city and under bismarck's direction they began systematically reducing the french capital to a smoking pile of rubble faced with a choice between capitulation or annihilation the provisional government chose the former and the city finally surrendered on january 27th at midnight after agreeing terms with bismarck an armistice came into effect which included provisions for an immediate ceasefire and the disarmament of all but a single french division after just six months the war was over despite being victorious in almost every single major engagement the germans had suffered substantial losses totaling around dead and 88 000 wounded but french casualties had been far greater over 150 000 dead with at least the same number of wounded and an astounding 723 000 captured the civilian population was also devastated with numerous towns and villages burnt to the ground in reprisal for partisan attacks and tens of thousands killed during various sieges but the bloodshed didn't end there on march 18th a communist uprising seized control of the capital and declared the paris commune independent of the third republic after hastily rebuilding their forces with bismarck's permission of course the republicans stormed the city and destroyed the commune in what became known as the bloody week between may the 21st and the 28th meanwhile the germans were busy celebrating the formation of their powerful prosperous new empire kaiser wilhelm would go on to see his nation expand to the status of a world power complete with extensive colonial holdings overseas his counterpart the unfortunate napoleon iii would go into exile and never return to france he died three years after the war living just long enough to see the republic place all of the blame for france's defeat squarely on his shoulders on his deathbed the disgraced emperor reportedly whispered the words isn't it true that we weren't cowards at sedan

below on september 1st 1939 the recently mobilized armies of germany invaded the republic of poland the defenders were rapidly pushed back by the speed and ferocity of the germans combined arms assault but continued to fight bravely until the soviet union attacked from the east sealing poland's fate on october 6th the invasion came to a close with only a tiny fraction of the polish army managing to escape through romania along with most of the country's top government officials these men formed a government in exile and maintained that poland had not surrendered despite the total occupation of their country unfortunately the defiance of these men did nothing to prevent the germans and soviets from carving up the lands of poland between them in accordance with a secret clause of the molotov ribbentrop pact the soviet union seized the eastern half of the country incorporating the territory into the biello russian and ukrainian ssrs the nazis directly annexed half of the remaining territory into germany granting a small slice to slovakia their client state the rest was placed under an administration known as the general government staffed exclusively by german officials almost immediately the general government began to terrorize the polish people establishing five ss units known as the einsatzgruppen to hunt down and execute potential threats to the occupation government armed with a list of 61 000 names including doctors intellectuals political activists and first world war veterans the einsatzgruppen rounded up and murdered over 16 000 people in the first few months after the invasion and by mid-1940 over 100 000 polish intellectuals had been massacred those who were not executed faced eviction over 2 million poles mostly landowners businessmen and other wealthy individuals were forced from their homes and relocated into slums and ghettos their homes were soon occupied by german settlers encouraged by the reich to resettle in the newly conquered laban's realm or living space in the east tens of thousands of polish refugees fled the country seeking asylum in romania to the south while many more were left displaced within poland having lost everything but their lives when the dust of relocation and displacement had settled the general government began to institute policies designed to eradicate polish culture all cultural institutions from schools and museums to theaters libraries and newspapers were shut down radio receivers were confiscated books were burned all polish music was banned and every monument or piece of polish art the ss could get their hands on was stolen or destroyed the germans intended to strip away any sense of national or cultural identity from the polish people in hopes of breaking their will to resist following the attack on polish culture as a whole the occupiers honed in on the jewish people in april of 1940 the jewish citizens of warsaw were forced to begin construction of a walled ghetto within the ruined city where they would be forced to live the jewish community in warsaw made up over 30 of its total population but the area covered by the ghetto comprised only about five percent of the city as a result conditions in the ghetto were desperately cramped and unsanitary leading to outbreaks of typhus and other diseases the same was true of other ghettos of which more than 300 were built over the course of the occupation millions of jews romani slavs and disabled people were forced to live in these dismal slums before being shipped off to concentration camps while conditions in ghettos were especially horrid the poles living outside of them were not much better off food was strictly rationed leading to mass starvation in urban areas people often had to wander for days at a time in search of somewhere they could buy food and the portions they managed to scrounge up were barely enough to get by but starvation was not the only threat they faced there was also the danger of being pressed into the general government's forced labor service known as the bowdinst initially all poles over the age of 18 were eligible for forced labor and could be pressed into service at any time the minimum age was soon lowered to 14 and for jews it was twelve of those recruited into the boudin's many were sent to work in factories farms and construction sites within poland some of the less fortunate were deported to work in germany or other occupied territories never to return home as the war went on german demands for labor increased dramatically and the punishments for evading forced labor conscription became more severe by 1943 failing to turn up for forced labor became a crime punishable by death in the countryside especially brutal retaliations were carried out against entire communities for attempting to evade the labor draft if a community failed to provide enough workers to satisfy the government's quota german soldiers would surround the village and burn it to the ground massacring everyone and leaving the charred ruins as a message to surrounding villages in the face of such brutality resistance was inevitable underground guerrilla armies formed almost as soon as the invasion ceased and thousands of poles flocked to their banners these ragtag forces eventually coalesced into a unified organization known as the polish underground state which attempted to maintain some continuity of the polish nation beneath the shadow of the general government through their military branch known as the home army the underground state carried out guerrilla attacks on occupying forces disrupted german supply lines and assassinated nazi officers meanwhile the underground civilian arm coordinated clandestine education for children distributed aid wherever possible and disseminated anti-german publications by 1943 the underground state had grown to over 300 000 members and was powerful enough to operate its own secret criminal courts [Music] in these underground courts thousands of polls suspected of supporting or collaborating with nazi occupiers were arrested and brought to trial they included poles who served as police officers acted in german films wrote for german-produced newspapers or worked for the general government administration ironically these trials often made life harder for the polish civilians they were meant to avenge poles who were removed from positions of authority within the police and administration were replaced by german officials with even less sympathy for the polish people access to food became even more scarce and police brutality became worse and worse in spite of the underground's court's intentions the general government fought hard to suppress the underground state responding to every major action with brutal reprisals against the polish people frequently in cities like warsaw the nazis would respond to home army attacks by rounding up and executing up to 100 random civilians leaving their bodies hanging in the streets as a grisly warning to their former neighbors however horrific violence inflicted by the nazis only stiffened the resolve of the resistance movement even among the most downtrodden of the polish people in the spring of 1943 when the germans entered a warsaw ghetto to organize another round of deportation to the death camps a few hundred members of the jewish resistance fought back armed with grenades and small arms provided by the home army the fighters killed dozens of nazi soldiers and forced them to withdraw from the ghetto in retaliation the ss invaded the ghetto and raised it killing 13 000 people afterwards the warsaw concentration camp was established in the ruins of the ghetto to exterminate everyone who had remained the aftermath of the warsaw ghetto uprising left the home army outraged and by that time they were large and organized enough to begin preparing for revenge as the soviets drove back the german army in the east the polish underground planned a massive uprising across the entire country codenamed tempest the operation began in early january 1944 when the red army crossed the pre-war polish border over 6 500 soldiers rose up across poland and began fighting against the german army alongside soviet troops their efforts to disrupt german defenses were largely successful but as soon as the fighting stopped the polls worst fears about their new allies were confirmed the soviets forcibly disarmed and arrested all home army soldiers they had fought beside treating them as enemy prisoners of war by the summer when it had become abundantly clear that the soviets were not their allies the home army decided that the only way to ensure poland's independence would be to liberate the capital and have the government in exile return to this end on august 1st the polish resistance in warsaw rose up against the german occupiers beginning the warsaw uprising somewhere between 20 and 50 000 people fought in the uprising the vast majority of them civilians who had been pushed past the breaking point by years of brutal nazi rule at first they experienced great success seizing control of central warsaw and sending the german garrison into retreat the leaders of the uprising expected the rapidly advancing red army to take advantage of the chaos and occupy the city but they stopped on the opposite bank of the vestula river barely six miles from the city center there the soviet forces sat back and watched as german reinforcements arrived and began to suppress the uprising fighting in the streets was horrific and much of the city was destroyed as the poles fought tooth and nail for every inch of terrain in an effort to demoralize the uprisers the germans began to massacre polish civilians on mass ss squads were deployed into captured neighborhoods where they proceeded house by house murdering everyone inside and burning the bodies men women and children alike were slaughtered and by the end of the uprising over 105 000 polish civilians had been killed the home army fought hard but by october they were forced to surrender the germans systematically leveled much of what remained of the city in retaliation for the uprising leaving almost the entirety of warsaw in ruins almost all of those remaining in the city more than 700 000 people were expelled forced to become refugees and the nazis destroyed their homes out of spite only a few hundred poles remained in the city when all was said and done hiding out among the rebel of their capital the uprisings of the home army and the collapse of the eastern front sealed the fate of the jews remaining in the polish ghettos throughout 1944 the inhabitants of the ghettos were rapidly shipped off to death camps like auschwitz and treblinka when the camps reached capacity the ss resorted to simply shooting jewish families in their homes while some made valiant efforts to resist the exhausted malnourished and largely unarmed prisoners could do little to prevent their fate the most successful of these efforts was the warsaw ghetto uprising but for all their courage and tenacity their fight ended in defeat most other attempts at jewish resistance ended similarly and by the time the war ended three million polish jews had been killed out of a pre-war population of 3.5 million [Music] the german occupation took a horrible toll on the people of poland over 5.6 million polish citizens were killed amounting to over 20 percent of the country's population those who survived were left with a largely ruined nation now under the control of the soviets who wasted no time establishing a puppet communist government many felt betrayed by their allies in the west who had not only failed to help them withstand the invasion in 1939 but had then left the polish people at the mercy of the germans and soviets even as the tides of war turned these feelings of resentment and other very real scars of foreign occupation remain visible

game set up for viewers more on that at the end of this video germany's first foray into armored warfare began during the great war with the sturm panzerwarden art sieben fowl or sturm panzerwagen a7v created in response to the british tanks that had started appearing on the western front in september of 1916 the a7v was quickly prototyped and entered production almost exactly one year later due to being manufactured by hand no two a7vs were entirely alike although arguably just as effective as the british mark iv the a7v was only built in very small numbers and saw action in a mere handful of engagements before the end of the war following its defeat at the hands of the allies in the first world war germany was forced to cease all domestic tank production until the treaty of apollo in 1922 enabled the creation of the kama tank school near kazan in the soviet union safely away from prying eyes various german companies began competing to produce new tank designs under a veil of absolute secrecy the first major entry of this program was equals taktor or gross tractor which translates directly to large tractor a code name designated for a 16 ton tracked vehicle with two turrets one equipped with a 75 millimeter cannon and the other mounting a 7.92 millimeter machine gun six prototypes were built and underwent testing but were rejected for mass production if anything it was the soviets who gained most from the gross tractor using it as inspiration for their own multi-turreted tanks such as the t28 during this same period several prototypes of a second much lighter vehicle codenamed the leicester were built by croup and reinmatal armed with a 37 millimeter cannon and capable of speeds up to 19 miles or 30 kilometers per hour the prototypes provided crucial insights into the development of new and better vehicles with improved ergonomics and crew layouts despite the obvious shortcomings of the gross tractor some german officers still clung to the outdated concept of the tank as a land battleship therefore in 1934 the enormous three turreted neu beforezoyg was constructed this lumbering behemoth was an effective propaganda tool and took center stage during berlin's international automobile exposition in 1939. unfortunately it proved totally useless on the battlefield due to its slow speed and weak armor that could easily be pierced by rifle caliber ammunition fortunately for the vehmasht much more practical designs were already in the works the first of these was the panzer eins infantry support tank or panzer one armed with twin light machine guns over a hundred panzer ones participated in the spanish civil war the first time german tanks had seen combat since the first world war this combat experience proved vital to the development of germany's armored doctrine and the panzer one would go on to see combat in just about every theater of the second world war its chassis was also used by a number of early tank destroyers and self-propelled guns although german tank doctrine was already shifting towards the use of heavier vehicles delays in their production led to the creation of an interim design the panzer zvay or panzer ii armed with a magazine magazine-fed 20-millimeter auto cannon this light tank could punch above its weight class panzer twos formed the bulk of the vermont's armored divisions during the invasion of poland and gave a good account of themselves in most engagements the panzer ii saw service right up to the end of the war with the chassis serving as the basis for many specialized vehicles such as the martyr 2 tank destroyer and west self-propelled artillery piece by 1937 production of heavier vehicles had finally gotten underway starting with 10 prototypes of the panzer 3 or panzer 3 medium tank thanks to its superior ergonomics the crew of a panzer iii could operate much more efficiently than their french or british counterparts the prototype saw limited combat during the invasion of poland but these encounters gave valuable insight into both the strengths and weaknesses of the design by the time of the invasion of france the panzer iii had been upgraded to the aspergeron a or variant e which had thicker armor and improved suspension [Music] thanks to their excellent leadership coordination and usage of radio communication the panzer iii was able to run rings around many of the slow lumbering french tanks they encountered despite often being substantially outgunned by them the panzer iii continued to rapidly evolve after the invasion of france and by the time of the north africa campaign most were equipped with the short barreled 50 millimeter cannon which would be standardized with the variant h but the fighting in north africa also brought the germans into contact with their first american tanks whose long-barreled 75 millimeter guns could easily pierce the armor of any panzer iii additionally the short 50 millimeter cannon proved inadequate against russian tanks such as the kv-1 and t-34 seeing this weakness adolf hitler ordered an upgrade resulting in the variant l which included spaced armor around the turret mantlet and upper hull soon afterwards the panzer 3 reached its ultimate evolution with the variant m which added a deep wading exhaust for river crossings and shirts and armor panels for protection against man man-portable anti-tank weapons of course the panzer 3 was not the only medium tank that began production in the 1930s following an extensive series of prototype designs by multiple companies the first panzerfia or panzer fours began to roll off the production line just in time for the invasion of poland these were initially infantry support tanks lobbing high explosive shells from their short 75 millimeter cannons to destroy enemy bunkers and machine gun nests a job they excelled at the cannon was also more than adequate to deal with the lightly armored vehicles used by the polish army just like its smaller counterpart the panzer iv received extensive upgrades just prior to the invasion of france resulting in the variant d which had better suspension and improved armor protection the panzer iv proved an excellent vehicle during the early stages of the war but it was outgunned by most british and american tanks and still vulnerable to even low caliber anti-tank guns in early 1941 the panzer iv was upgraded further with the aspirjung f heinz or variant f1 which increased the frontal armor thickness to 50 millimeters and improved the turret armor thickness by 30 millimeters the tracks were also widened and the suspension redesigned but just like the panzer 3 the short-barreled cannon was never powerful enough at a long range a solution was found in november of 1941 when the panzer iv received a long-barreled 75 millimeter cannon that could penetrate all but the thickest armor this transitional model was initially known as the variant f2 and was later renamed the variant g after receiving additional armor plating by 1944 the panzer iv had reached its full potential in the form of the variant h which featured shirts and panels similar to those on the panzer iii however it would be all downhill from here as supply shortages forced the vermost to simplify the design with the variant j which removed the turret motor and replaced the scherzen with wire mesh even so the panzer iv continued serving the vermont faithfully right up until the end of the war as useful as the panzer iii and fours were plans for larger and more powerful vehicles had been floating around since as early as 1935. after the total failure of the neue beforezoyg german engineers went back to the drawing board and came up with a series of prototypes that slowly but surely evolved into arguably the most iconic tank of all time the tiga ice or tiger won with its thick armor devastating 88 millimeter cannon and surprisingly good mobility the tiger one was a terrifying force on the battlefield exemplifying the german idea of quality over quantity as such production figures were very low fewer than 2 000 units overall during its operational lifespan the tiger one received minor upgrades including a new periscope cupola various internal modifications and a new exhaust system while expensive the tiger one was effective in its intended role with its only real shortcoming being the lack of units available for deployment but hitler was convinced that the problem lay not in the number of tiger tanks on the battlefield but instead with their size and armament his solution was the tiga osferon bay a massively oversized and overloaded vehicle seemingly built from the ground up to devour germany's resources as fast as possible to make matters worse it was later discovered that many tiger twos had inferior welding to their older counterparts and even shells unable to penetrate the armor could slowly crack and deform the chassis to the point of breakdown german supply shortages eventually reached a point where as many king tigers were being abandoned due to the lack of spare parts and fuel as were being destroyed by enemy fire in the end the tiger ii caused far more panic among its own mechanics and quartermasters than it did among enemy troops not all of germany's late war tank designs were as impractical as the tiger ii however in 1943 the allies would encounter the vermont's second big cat the panta or panther envisioned as a replacement for the panzer iv the panther boasted well-sloped frontal armor a mighty 75 millimeter gun and on-road speeds of up to 55 kilometers or 34 miles per hour while much larger and more advanced than the panzer iv the panther was not especially difficult or expensive to produce compared to the tiger and around 6 000 were built between 1943 and 1945. the initial version was called the variant d and was modified part way through production to mount a new cupola and eliminate weak spots created by the driver's vision slit and whole machine gun port side armor panels were also added after the panther was proven vulnerable to the 14.5 millimeter anti-tank rifles used by russian infantry overall armor thickness was further increased with the variant a though the design remained the same except for minor details unfortunately the panther suffered from the same reliability problems and parts shortages as the tiger ii the suspension system in particular was over complicated while the transmission was prone to failing in the heat of combat the turret was well armored but the mantlet was eventually redesigned with the variant g eliminating the tendency for it to deflect rounds straight downwards into the hole the panther served until the fall of the third reich and despite its issue remains one of the best late war tanks fielded by the german military in the end not even the tiger and panther were able to save the nazi regime for destruction and for many years the divided german nation had to make do with equipment borrowed from either the americans or the soviets but in 1956 the bundeswehr received permission to begin fielding domestic tank designs once again resulting in the birth of the leopot eins or leopard 1 a main battle tank that gave up thick armor plating in favor of superb mobility the leopard one was soon recognized as one of the best tanks on the market and orders flooded in from all around the world german engineers quickly improved the base design adding a thermal jacket to the barrel and side skirts for better track protection but despite rave reviews by operators across the world the leopard 1 would not see sustained combat until the bosnian war where leopard 1a5s were used by peacekeeping forces during several operations still not wholly content with their design german engineers continued to work with their american counterparts during the cold war to produce an even better armored fighting vehicle but this super tank codenamed the m beitei tsipsek or mbt 70 was eventually cancelled and the bundeswehr struck out on their own with the leopot zvei or leopard 2 built to take advantage of new advances in armor and fire control technologies the leopard 2 swiftly came to be regarded by most operators as the best tank in europe easily competitive with the american m1 abrams the leopard 2 remains germany's primary mbt and a whole seven

American war of independence such as the battles of Lexington and Concord in contrast to the British regulars they fought they wore a patchwork of Civilian clothing the first American regulars were equipped with muskets much like the rest of the world during the first years of their existence the American Military was not formally organized until Prussian officer Friedrich Von Steuben disciplined them into a true Fighting Force at Valley Forge where Americans began habitually wearing uniforms these newly professionalized soldiers marched to victories at Saratoga Kings Mountain and ultimately Yorktown although Continental militiamen were used extensively for the entirety of the war unlike their musketeer counterparts Morgan's Rifleman Who functioned as a light infant entry Force

of the uniform convinced a Prussian influence particularly the cuffs and collar officers continued to have edged weapons at their side a popular piece for ranked individuals of most armies around the world the pommels of American Sabers were styled after Eagle's heads further cementing the bald eagle as a symbol of American identity American forces were able to stand their ground and hold the line during the siege of Fort Texas although the blue color was still prominent there was a noticeable change in headwear soldiers began to wear a type of visor cap in contrast to the taller and somewhat less fashionable Shaco style hats Union troops also known federals were outfitted in dark blue tunics and Cappy hats borrowed from the French design while this was the standard uniform for the union

Battlefield while previously introduced for far out western territories the Montana peaked design hat was adopted by the Army as a service cover the Army at this time also developed a tropical lightweight uniform for its campaigns in East Asia when the United States entered the Great War they had adapted much of the appearance of their British counterparts the steel Brody helmet often nicknamed a doughboy helmet and khaki or olive drab battle dress the American expeditionary Force fought its way to Victory on the Western Front the United States saw its Ground Forces make their debut in Operation Torch fighting alongside the British in North Africa against the Ferocious German Africa Corps ultimately driving the Nazis back to the Italian mainland taking note of the

soviet union had been ongoing since june 1941 when the german military pierced deep into enemy territory as part of operation barbarossa while the soviets were initially caught off guard and suffered heavy losses they managed to push back the invaders at several key points germans suffered a massive setback after the battle of stalingrad in february of 1943 and when their last major offensive was halted that summer at the battle of kursk the axis forces were forced into a defensive position the soviet counter-attack that followed kursk drove the vermont back over 800 kilometers or 500 miles before finally coming to a halt in february of 1944 of the three army groups holding the eastern front army group south was the most severely affected suffering a series of defeats that forced them much further back than the other army groups creating a salient in the access line for the first few months of 1944 german strategists assumed that the soviets would press this advantage in the south in order to capture the balkan oil fields and advance through southern poland into the heart of germany accordingly the southern sector was heavily reinforced with nearly the entire operational reserve of the eastern front being redeployed there by may contrary to german fears soviet commanders never intended to target that sector viewing a southern offensive as too vulnerable to flanking and counter-attacks they believed that the safest target would be biella russia defended by army group center taking biello russia would result in the collapse of the entire german front line allowing soviets to launch joint offensives in the north and south [Music] in order to give their plan codenamed operation bagration the best possible chance to succeed the soviets launched a massive campaign of deception in early 1944 referred to in russian strategy as a mosquito rovka campaign literally translated as camouflage mosquito rothko was designed to gain the element of surprise against enemy forces the campaign involved diverting significant forces as visibly as possible toward the southern sector preparing a large and noticeable buildup to encourage the germans to further reinforce the bulge at the same time they created the illusion that they were withdrawing forces from the bella russian front in part by driving vehicles and tanks away during the day only to bring those vehicles back camouflaged in the dark of night the soviet's efforts to convince the germans that they were planning an attack in the south were successful in part because they actually were an offensive through ukraine into the levolf semi-shoe area of southern poland was being planned at the exact same time as operation begration this element of truth helped sell the soviet deception when the offensive began in biella russia instead the germans with all their eggs stuffed into vaulter models basket would be caught completely off guard by the middle of june 1944 the soviets had amassed over 1.6 million personnel for bagration with over 32 000 artillery pieces 5 800 tanks and 7 800 aircraft this massive force was supported by soviet partisans in biella russia and members of the polish resistance who softened up the german defenses by sabotaging railroad lines throughout the region army group center by that time consisted of about half as many personnel and only a tenth of the number of tanks and aircraft their defenses however included trench lines extensive field fortifications and massive minefields across the entire front which they hoped would make up for their shortages and manpower in the early morning hours of june 22nd the third anniversary of hitler's invasion of the soviet union operation bagration began soviet infantry first advanced from the north in a pincer maneuver meant to encircle the city of vitisc aerial bombardment followed devastating german artillery positions in support of the infantry advance and soviet forces quickly began to close in to the north and south of the city at dawn the next day russian tanks rolled in led by a wave of t-34s specially modified with massive metal rollers for clearing mines after these giant rolling pins swept through german minefields infantry poured in behind them striking at regions which were otherwise weakly defended and punching through enemy lines this highly effective tactic was part of the soviet strategy of deep battle which centered around achieving strategic breakthroughs and pushing into enemy territory to undermine their ability to defend the rest of their lines developed in the 1920s and 1930s deep battle doctrine was first used to its fullest extent in operation bagration and its effectiveness was undeniable with armored support the soviet assault pushed in further into enemy territory and vitipsk was completely encircled by june 25th the entire german 53rd corps was trapped in the city after high command had repeatedly denied their requests to evacuate two days later the city was taken and all 30 000 men in the 53rd corps were killed or taken prisoner meanwhile alongside the northern assault another pincer attack was launched on june 23rd in the south targeting the cities of bobrusk and mogolev the southernmost pincer in this maneuver targeting bobowisk was personally commanded by soviet general konstantine rokosovsky who had been largely responsible for planning the operation as a whole rokosovsky's force crashed into the german lines and advanced almost unopposed driving much further than anticipated this good fortune came after the nearby german 9th army attempted to redeploy its tanks to defend against his offensive but most of the vehicles broke down in the marshy terrain leaving the southern force with little opposition as for mogollov the primary purpose of the offensive was to occupy the german fourth army dominate the road network and take the city if possible in this the russian army was incredibly successful by june 28th magulef had fallen and a day later bobrusk was captured most of the 4th and 9th armies were killed were taken by the russians as prisoners of war in less than a week the german front line was shattered over 100 000 men had been lost and the soviet offensive showed no signs of slowing down as access commanders scrambled to scrape together improvised defenses the two pincer forces began to advance on the main objective of operation bagration the belarussian capital of minsk through a combination of exceptional planning and overwhelming force the red army managed to completely overwhelm the german defenses across a wide front the soviets pressed this advantage capturing all of their initial objectives and pushing toward minsk where one hundred thousand german soldiers were now at risk of encirclement by the end of june 1944 the axis front line in biella russia had been broken and two soviet armies were driving into their territory from the north and south the germans were taken completely by surprise and high command was scrambling to send reinforcements to stave off this overwhelming attack the commander of army group center field marshal ernst bush was hastily replaced with valtter modal in hopes that the more seasoned commander could salvage the defense model stepped into a desperate situation the ninth army was all but shattered by the soviet pincer in the south and the fourth army to the east of minsk had been circumvented and was now in serious danger of being encircled he ordered the fourth and ninth armies to rapidly withdraw toward minsk and began to redeploy bombers and armored divisions from army group north and south to support them but by this time the soviets controlled the sky and they inflicted heavy casualties on these incoming reinforcements as well as the retreating forces of army group center however the fifth panzer division did manage to make it through the aerial bombardment and arrived in minsk on june 27th where they were put to work guarding one of the key roads to the northeast of the city the fifth panzer's heavy tiger tanks were used to great effect in slowing down the soviet offense inflicting staggering losses on enemy armored units but while the german heavy tanks were more effective than the t-34s they faced they were not invincible and the faltering nazi war machine simply could not afford to replace the tanks they lost the soviets steadily wore down the mighty tigers and within two days the 159 heavy tanks of the 5th panzer division had been reduced to just 18 no longer able to hold back the enemy advance on july 3 the two prongs of the soviet advance met outside of minsk completing the encirclement of the city the remnants of the ninth army were trapped within along with several units that had been desperately redeployed to assist them while the fourth army was still a few miles to the east now with nowhere to run the soviet second guard's tank core pierced the defenses of minsk early on the morning of the third and had successfully cleared the city of enemy troops by the next [Music] day what was left of the fourth and ninth armies were now surrounded outside the city and over the next few days the noose was slowly tightened around them several breakouts were attempted but all of these efforts ended in failure culminating in a disastrous attempt on july 8th that led to the capture of lieutenant general vincent's mullah the acting commander of the fourth army mullah ordered a full surrender of his remaining forces and around sixty thousand of the one hundred thousand men who would be caught in the encirclement were taken prisoner the rest had already been killed by this point army group center was all but destroyed since the beginning of operation bhagration 25 divisions and around 300 000 men had been killed or captured along with huge amounts of materiel that the germans could no longer afford to replace before we continue i'd like to let you

toward the baltic sea the north offensive sought to drive a wedge between the remnants of army group center and north in hopes of cutting off and destroying the latter once this gap was formed in early july the soviet first baltic front rapidly advanced into the breach in an effort to trap army group north between them and the sea [Music] their main target was the lithuanian city of chole which the soviets seized on july 27th with little opposition from the small german garrison after capturing the city the forces of the baltic front carried on reaching the gulf of riga on july 31st and severing land communications between army group center and north at the same time offensives targeting vilnius and biaostock succeeded in driving the germans from most of lithuania and northern poland meanwhile a separate attack was launched through ukraine in the south which would see these soviets breaking through in the balkans and prompt the defection of romania and bulgaria to the common turn operation bagration continued for several more weeks with the germans being forced back further and further all across the front by mid-august the soviets had claimed over 550 kilometers or 340 miles of territory and were now within sight of warsaw the germans made a desperate last-ditch effort to hold the line at the vestula river but they were soundly defeated by the 47th and 8th guard's armies in the lublin breast offensive which ended on august 2nd with the capture of several key bridge heads over the vestula in the weeks following the capture of minsk one hundred thousand more germans were killed or captured and the entirety of army group north had become effectively trapped in the baltic states where they would hold out in isolation for the rest of the war the site of soviet forces approaching on the horizon brought hope to the people of warsaw who had suffered greatly under german occupation prompting the polish resistance to launch an uprising in the city on august 1st between 20 and 50 000 poles rose up against the occupying garrison and fierce fighting broke out in the streets that initially fought the german army to a standstill but despite heavy losses they had suffered at the hands of the soviets the nazi war machine was not defeated yet fresh troops and armored units withdrawn from the fighting in italy arrived to reinforce the front against the soviet advance in mid-august and some of these forces were diverted to put down the revolt in warsaw even in the face of overwhelming odds the people of warsaw kept fighting until october resulting in the destruction of much of the city the soviets faced with these fresh german reinforcements logistical issues from the rapid advance and the onset of bad weather finally brought their offensive to a halt on august 19th when the dust settled even the leaders of the soviet union were surprised at the extent of the success of operation by gration the entirety of soviet yellow russia had been liberated and over a quarter of germany's forces on the eastern front had been annihilated in an effort to prove the extent of their victory to the world 57 000 prisoners taken from the encirclement at minsk were humiliatingly paraded through the streets of moscow in late july in a ceremony eerily reminiscent of an ancient roman triumph while estimates of the exact casualties from operation by gration very recent research suggests around 400 000 men lost on the german side mostly captured in the soviet's many successful encirclements the red army suffered substantial losses of its own however with around 180 000 men killed and over 500 000 reported as wounded or sick by the end of operation bagration the situation on the eastern front had gone from bad to utterly desperate for nazi germany their remaining forces in the north and south were cut off from one another and their faltering war machine was unable to replace the losses suffered by army group center although the fighting in the east was far from over the axis forces would spend the rest of the war on the back foot as soviet forces pushed ever closer to berlin thanks again to battle warship for sponsoring this

in the empire's rubble by the 8th century a.d europe was mostly controlled by the various gothic kingdoms who had dealt roam its death blow remarkably adaptable the goths settled into their new lands as nobles and administrators even taking up their own brand of christianity arianism today we will be discussing how these germanic kings would go on to form the holy roman empire and how those who had once torn down the roman colossus would become their successors before we begin our deep dive into medieval politics i'd like to highlight our sponsor for this video mindstone an innovative new

martell's dramatic and unlikely victory at tour dashed all hopes the umayyads had of moving beyond iberia it also marked the beginning of the carolingian dynasty with martell's son pep in the short becoming the king of the franks in 751 despite his dimunitive moniker pepin was a wise ruler who cultivated a strong relationship with the church greatly expanding the power and influence of the papacy by granting pope stefan ii control over a number of italian cities that pepin had conquered from the lombards thus were born the papal states however it would not be until the reign of pepin's own sons charlemagne and carliman that the possibility of building a true empire to rival rome presented itself despite splitting the kingdom equally between charlemagne and carlin in accordance with the frankish inheritance law the two brothers began plotting against each other with lawsuits not having been invented yet the two brothers prepared for the next best thing civil war but conflict was averted when carliman died in glory armor covered in the gore of an acute nosebleed with his only true rival dead the energetic and capable charlemagne was now king of all francia and the reunited kingdom soon became the most powerful nation in europe it was a power that would soon be tested in 795 the consecration of pope leo iii sent shockwaves through the catholic world leo was a commoner with no political allies or influence and the election of a low-class pontiff was unheard of the nobility within the new pope's flock quickly sought to gently persuade leo to abdicate and he was forced to flee rome in 799 after nearly having his eyes and tongue torn out by hired thugs thanks to his family's positive standing with thee church charlemagne was the logical person to turn to for help and leo was soon back in rome under heavy carolingian guard but with his enemies accusing him of crimes ranging from adultery to perjury pope leo was left with little choice but to swear an oath of purgation stating his innocence before god on pain of eternal damnation unable to challenge this declaration without calling their own religious integrity into question leo's enemies were forced to admit defeat and most were promptly exiled with his power unquestionably restored pope leo presided over holy mass in old saint peter's basilica and as a reward for his service leo christened charlemagne imperator romanarum emperor of the romans before the dumbfounded faithful to say this was a controversial move would be an understatement for one thing the mantle of imperator romanarum was already taken by empress irene in constantinople despite having lost control of italy the roman empire had preserved thanks to its prosperous eastern territories and its inhabitants viewed themselves as being part of the exact same national and political entity that had existed since the founding of rome itself the papacy had even endorsed this viewpoint having maintained for centuries that the person sitting on the throne in constantinople empress irene at this point was the legitimate ruler of all former roman holdings in europe with a single declaration pope leo iii had unpended political and religious conventions which had been in place for over 400 years why was leo so ready to flout tradition the relationship between the church and the roman empire had been initially one of mutual benefit the pope endorsed the legitimacy of each new emperor in exchange for their assurance that the empire would come to their aid in any time of need but over the years the papacy had come to regard the title of emperor as ultimately originating from god designated specifically by the pope and returned to him upon the death of each emperor finally it was unthinkable for a patriarchal organization like the church to be seen as declaring a woman as emperor so empress irene remained unrecognized despite her holding the title leo had just given away due to the belief that the imperial title could only be granted by the church charlemagne was barred from declaring a new imperial dynasty and his intense piety prevented him from questioning this state of affairs furthermore frankish succession laws meant that the vast territories he had amassed were inevitably split into separate nations by his heirs within just a few generations mighty francia had reverted into squabbling petty kingdoms and the imperial title was reduced to little more than a bribe dispensed by the pope to ensure the loyalty of italian nobles when burniker the first of italy was assassinated in 924 the title was rendered all but defunct however the coronation of otto the first as king of east francia in 962 a.d would resurrect the title imperator romanarum in stunning fashion by this point in history east francia's culture and politics were distinct from its western neighbor causing many to refer to it as the kingdom of germany the early days of otto's reign were marked by endemic political intrigue the impractical frankish inheritance laws responsible for tearing the carolingian empire apart had long since been discarded in favor of an elective monarchy with the electoral vote being carried out by the most powerful dukes of the realm but otto's father king henry disregarded tradition by naming his son heir apparent without consulting the electors leading too much resentment the situation came to a head in 937 when civil war broke out between otto and his nobles who promptly sought aid from west francia in the bloody series of conflicts that followed otto distinguished himself by crushing the rebellion and re-establishing control over germany having consolidated power otto now began seeking to expand it further beginning with the subjugation of the kingdom of italy a key part of the old carolingian empire in a bid to consolidate his grip on the peninsula otto allowed the defeated berniger ii to style himself king of italy in exchange for bernier's fealty but he was resentful of his suzerain and when otto became distracted by affairs back in germany the king of italy launched a revolt crucially bernabeu's forces besieged the city of rome causing pope john xii to petition otto for aid seeing a chance to demonstrate his ring kissing otto raced south with an army and quickly forced bernard to retreat upon entering rome otto met with the pope and swore a solemn oath to defend the church against all adversaries having secured a powerful and influential protector once more the pope was more than happy to dust off the imperial title and declare otto emperor of the romans byzantines be damned unfortunately for john xii otto was no charlemagne he was contemptuous of pope john's alleged depravity and worldliness and chastised the pope for his lack of piety incensed at this ridicule from a mere earthly ruler the pontiff began plotting against otto from the moment he left rome but the new emperor was no fool and discovered the papal plan within a year for his treachery john xii was ignominiously deposed and a new pope was elected in his place this set an important precedent demonstrating that any sufficiently powerful emperor could easily defy the papacy and get away with it otto secured imperial power by having his son otto ii crowned his co-emperor by pope john xiii in 967 this skillful political maneuvering cemented the creation of a new imperial dynasty which would reign until 1024 although otto's actions secured a lasting claim to the title of roman emperor his roman empire was not yet holy his behavior also created a lasting animosity between the new emperors and the papacy with both claiming to be the main inheritors of the church's divine mandate and the legacy of ancient rome additionally otto's autocratic rulership alienated his nobility and as the power of his dynasty slowly waned they were able to take back control of the elective monarchy and extract numerous concessions from the new emperors this complicated relationship casted a shadow over the rule of frederick barbarossa the first the man who would finally make the german lands a so-called holy roman empire barbarossa was elected emperor of the romans and king of germany in 1152 but with little intrinsic power frederick had to politic his way through the courts of germany to accomplish anything of substance however frederick's boundless ambition drove him onward and he began planning to wrestle control back from his quarrel some nobles and restore the glory of the imperial throne his opportunity came just one year later in 1153 when pope eugene iii appealed to him for aid this was a dark time for the papacy with the abject failure of the second crusade having weakened their political sway in italy to such an extent that the citizens of rome had ejected the pope from the city and were calling for the church to renounce all of its worldly possessions not one to let a good crisis go to waste frederick signed the first treaty of constance with pope eugene promising to restore the pope's position in rome in exchange for a grand and public coronation as emperor this last point was critical as up until now frederick was merely an emperor elect and had yet to be crowned in a holy ceremony his attempts to enforce the treaty faced innumerable setbacks before the year ended pope eugene was dead with pope adrian iv replacing him and nominally upholding the agreement after a year-long campaign in the south of italy frederick arrived in rome in 1155 only to refuse to follow the ritual displays of subjugation to his holiness demanded by tradition the deeply offended adrian refused to move forward with the coronation until he had been sufficiently honored frederick eventually gave in but is quoted as muttering proper non adriano for st peter not adrian the hasty coronation that followed was punctuated by yet another revolt forcing frederick to spend his first few hours as emperor reestablishing control over the streets of rome he was then informed that his kingdom was in disarray after his year-long absence forcing him to retreat from italy and leave pope adrian to broker a humiliating peace with his amused opponents [Music] ironically this embarrassing affair would be the basis upon which frederick established the true holy roman empire bombarded with a series of angry letters from the pope that could easily have been interpreted as threats to revoke his new title frederick made the fateful decision to sever all imperial ties with the church for good in 1157 he declared his nation a holy empire and granted himself full power to appoint or dismiss members of the clergy within his domain finally the embittered frederick decreed that the title of roman emperor was now intrinsically holy that the leaders elected to the throne were holy roman emperors ruling with the backing of god from this point onwards no future emperor would ever seek to gain or consider the validity of their title based on papal endorsement thus was finally founded the holy roman empire its foundations were not built upon glorious wars of conquest or even great acts of personal valor instead they were constructed upon a centuries-old legacy of frustration mistrust and bitter arguments between church and state after centuries of petty rivalries civil wars and papal politics the holy roman empire was finally born at least in concept despite standing until 1806 the hre was more a set of kingdoms unified under a loose set of ideological principles than a homogeneous political entity backed by an absolutist state the citizens of the hre were also largely germanic with no claim to roman ancestry and the protestant reformation shattered any religious unity within the empire forever dispelling any hopes of it being seen as holy in the eyes of god but this very lack of centralized identity allowed the hre to endure centuries of internal upheaval and

2003 f-16 fighters scream to life on a nearby tarmac while c-130 cargo planes are loaded up with supplies a handful of soldiers play cards on a makeshift table trying to distract themselves from the anxiety in the air they are american british australian and polish all are exhausted by the long approach to the capital but they know that the fighting is not over yet as another plane departs for baghdad the australian announces royal flush and lays down his cards the others groan he's won but this is no ordinary game of poker on each card the face of a high-ranking iraqi official is printed they include generals ministers and on the ace of spades the president himself saddam hussein it is useful for the soldiers to familiarize themselves with these men soon enough they'll be hunting them hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian today we will be covering the 2003 invasion of iraq sometimes referred to as the second gulf war which saw hundreds of thousands of troops committed to an invasion that ended with the deposition of a dictator while we will cover some of the political background and context of this much discussed conflict this video will primarily focus on the combat maneuvers and objectives of the momentous invasion that sparked an eight-year occupation and insurgency but first if you haven't had the chance to check out our video on the first iraq war here is a quick recap after it ended with iraqi forces being expelled from kuwait the u.s soldiers sought to protect kurdish and shiite minorities in iraq by enforcing no-fly zones and launching airstrikes against strategic sites such as oil fields and military bases [Music] but following saddam hussein's repeated refusal to cooperate with un weapon inspectors the united states passed the iraqi liberation act which officially solidified the goal of regime change in the country at the time though this act simply consisted of providing millions of dollars to numerous opposition groups in the country with the hope of toppling saddam's government but as it turned out america's interventions in the middle east had already sown the seeds of a new conflict after the shocking events of president george w bush stood before a wounded nation and officially declared that a new war was about to commence a war on [Music] unlike previous conflicts america would now use preemptive force against any governments suspected of consorting with organizations especially in accordance with what would be remembered as the bush doctrine within weeks u.s forces had begun tearing apart afghanistan in pursuit of but when the infamous mastermind of the attacks slipped away the u.s turned its attention from afghanistan to iraq where for the past 12 years saddam hussein had increasingly been perceived as a threat to american geostrategic interests in the region this wasn't helped by his refusal to cooperate with the united nations in late 2002 the united states began building a case against the baathist government of iraq and sought the support of the u.n security council on top of the claimed ties to al-qaeda the bush administration had a laundry list of justifications for armed intervention including the mistreatment of civilians and the aforementioned expulsion of un weapons inspectors perhaps foreseeing how controversial these accusations would be in the future many in the un security council strenuously objected to the proposed invasion insisting that america pursue a diplomatic solution instead but even while the council debated cia teams were landing in iraq to lay the groundwork for a full-scale invasion the u.s had already made up its mind saddam's regime was doomed moving quickly members of the special activities division established contact with the kurdish peshmergas who opposed saddam then they began identifying key elements of iraqi leadership this intelligence would be used to devastating effect in the opening days of the conflict with surgical airstrikes killing many high-ranking officers additionally the special activities division captured a chemical weapons factory yet despite secretary of state colin powell's vivid descriptions of mobile weapons laboratories on the backs of trucks and train cars the facility was the only one of its kind found during the entire iraq war unsurprisingly these preemptive strikes did not help america's case to the u.n which continued to call for de-escalation key nato members such as france and canada were also highly vocal in condemning america's aggression opposition around the world mounted culminating with the largest recorded protest in human history when on february 2003 over 6 million people in 800 cities gathered to protest the war nevertheless in march of 2003 the united states and the coalition of the willing which included the united kingdom poland and australia among others began massing troops in the region unlike the war fought 12 years earlier they would be advancing without un approval the invasion began slowly the first phase consisted of numerous air strikes and covert raids on targets within the country with varying degrees of success one of the first of these was the battle of al-qaeda on march 17th when units of the british special air service attacked a suspected chemical weapons site housed in a water treatment facility near the syrian border but the iraqi defenders put up an unexpectedly spirited defense and the commando team was forced to withdraw under heavy fire frustrated they called in an airstrike leveling the entire facility and obliterating any potential evidence that chemical weapons were being held in the facility another strike occurred two days later at a community just outside baghdad called dura farms believing that saddam was visiting his sons in the area the united states saturated the area with 8 000 pounds of ordnance and 40 tomahawk cruise missiles in an attempt to wipe the iraqi dictator off the face of the earth however every single satellite-guided warhead missed its target and as a result over a dozen civilians were injured and one killed to complete the debacle it was later discovered that saddam's last visit to the area had been nearly a decade ago despite these issues the main invasion was finally getting underway based on the precedent set in the first gulf war and afghanistan most observers had expected a lengthy period of aerial bombardment before any ground offensive however the coalition instead opted to launch a rapid air and ground campaign that would avoid most urban areas and focus on decapitating the iraqi government this tactic later called shock and awe was chosen for two reasons first american leaders assumed that if the command structure was eliminated organized resistance would disintegrate second it was hoped that the civilian population would support the americans as liberators secretary of defense donald rumsfeld was particularly optimistic about this stating there will be iraqis who offer not only to help us but to help liberate the country and free the iraqi people as we will see this wasn't totally the case on the night of march 19th members of the 160th airborne known as the night stalkers destroyed more than 70 iraqi military outposts along the southern and western borders with the path cleared coalition forces advanced from kuwait in two prongs one directed north and one south a combined air and amphibious assault was also launched on the alpha peninsula on march 20th with the goal of securing the critical oil infrastructure located there american british and polish commandos all worked tirelessly to capture the offshore platforms before they could be sabotaged by the defenders despite significant resistance from entrenched iraqis supported by artillery fire the teams were able to secure the peninsula after a grueling three-day battle their efforts likely prevented a major ecological disaster and saved billions of dollars worth of equipment that saddam would otherwise have destroyed in a petty act of revenge unfortunately for the coalition this would be the last bit of good pr they would receive for quite some time as we'll see in the part 2 which is out right now the war for iraq was just beginning and even this initial taste of victory had been soured by the clumsy handling of al-qaeda and the disaster at dura farms while coalition casualties remained minimal intelligence failures would continue to plague future operations muddying the overall picture of the war in iraq to such an extent that many details remain unclear to this day the first major engagement began on march 23rd when a maintenance convoy of the third u.s infantry division took a wrong turn into nasseria right into the headquarters of the iraqi third corps caught in a hastily prepared ambush 15 of the 18 vehicles were destroyed by heavy weapons fire and 18 u.s soldiers were killed or captured but these strategic bridges over nisseria's modestly named saddam canal were secured later that day after men from the second marine division stormed the city suffering heavy casualties from the determined iraqi defenders as if the intense urban combat wasn't enough six marines were also killed in a friendly fire incident when an a-10 warthog mistakenly attacked their amphibious vehicle finally on the evening of march 24th the marines broke through and established a perimeter north of the city which held up despite multiple counter-attacks by iraqi forces and the fedaying saddam militia who were fanatical not only about saddam but apparently also about darth vader further north was the town of najaf which was situated close to highways leading to the important cities of karbala and baghdad due to its strategic location coalition forces decided not to bypass najaf and instead chose to isolate the town out of fears it could become a staging area for attacks against american supply lines to accomplish this the coalition needed to capture the bridges to the north and south of the town elements of the first brigade combat team attacked the northern bridge codenamed jenkins in the early hours of march 25th but made slow progress until they linked up with reinforcements before dawn the americans eventually fought their way across the bridge despite desperate attempts by iraqi engineers to destroy it around the same time u.s forces advanced on the southern bridge codenamed objective floyd resistance by both regular military and militia forces was intense at both sites on one occasion an iraqi drove a city bus at full speed into an m3 bradley cfv on march 26th najaf was successfully encircled and the attackers were relieved by the 101st airborne over the next several days the americans swept through the town with tanks and infantry the 101st deliberately left a single road out of the city open in the hope of using it as a kill zone for escaping troops on april 1st some weary iraqi soldiers took the bait and were ambushed by snipers and helicopter gunships and the city ultimately fell on april 4th to the south british forces had an unexpectedly difficult time taking basra and its nearby port starting on march 27th they whittled down the iraqi garrison defending the valuable port over the course of two weeks when they finally gained control of the vital waterway only 11 britons had died while the iraqis had lost some 40 to 50 times that number when british armor finally rolled into the city they were welcomed by jubilant locals as predicted by u.s secretary of defense donald rumsfeld unfortunately however the crowds quickly turned into mobs of looters the final major engagement before coalition forces arrived in baghdad was at the battle of karbala gap a roughly 25 mile or 40 kilometer long strip of land flanked by the euphrates and rezaza rivers iraqi commanders were well aware of the gap's strategic importance and had placed two divisions of the elite republican guard to block the americans advance however saddam hussein's son crusade severely weakened the defense by redirecting some of them to the north which proved to be a fatal mistake on april 1st american troops broke through the gap reaching the euphrates at the city of museeb though several iraqi armored divisions counter-attacked on the night of april 3rd they were driven back by aircraft and rocket fire and the coalition held on to the important bridgehead with the path to baghdad forced open and victory on the horizon a last bloody struggle for the capital began while the iraqi army had almost completely disintegrated at this point the baffist party militias holding the city did not hesitate to utilize underhanded tactics to slow the coalition advance after extended skirmishes with the defenders colonel david perkins launched a surprise thunder run of nearly 30 tanks straight into the city on april 5th once behind enemy lines the column came under intense fire from militiamen disguised as civilians but perkins was able to identify their defensive positions and execute a fighting withdrawal u.s marines then stormed the diallo bridge on the eastern side of the city and advanced along the northern bank of the euphrates aware that this flank was almost entirely undefended the nervous troops fired on any car refusing to haul out of fear of suicide bombers amidst this carnage perkins led another thunder run into the heart of the capital on the seventh and rewarded himself by spending the night in one of saddam's opulent palaces after a final desperate defense by the militias the city was finally captured on april 9th there were some initial celebrations by iraqi civilians including widespread vandalism of statues and portraits depicting the now defeated saddam however as in basra massive waves of looting soon followed and continued until u.s forces cracked down on offenders but saddam himself proved elusive and would not be captured for many months coalition soldiers would spend their time securing the occupation and searching for other high-value government officials that had escaped the invasion but as the coalition searched for these officials violence between iraq's minority groups soon erupted and insurgents began to assemble nonetheless on may 1st 2003 off the coast of san diego president bush made a dramatic appearance landing on the aircraft carrier uss abraham lincoln the former air national guard aviator wore a flight suit for his televised address in front of a national audience standing in front of an enormous banner reading mission accomplished he announced the end of major combat operations in iraq at the time the proclamation seemed reasonable the iraqi military was in shambles and saddam hussein had been reduced from an autocrat to a fugitive but despite all appearances the troubles were just beginning for the next eight years the coalition was engaged in a protracted counter insurgency and suffered heavy casualties while many thousands of civilians lost their lives in 2003 the mission may have been accomplished and the brief conventional phase of fighting was indeed finished but much like in afghanistan the war in iraq had only just begun hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian and in today's episode we'll be taking our second look at the controversial subject of the 2003 iraq war this time however we will be covering the events from the iraqi perspective by exploring how the iraqi people reacted to the invasion and the subsequent occupation by western powers we'll also look at the rise of extremism and sectarianism that occurred after president saddam hussein's regime was toppled and how all this set the stage for the many years of insurrections civil war and international intervention it cannot be overemphasized how much of a shock the 2003 invasion was to the iraqi people even when president george bush gave iraq his famous 48-hour ultimatum iraqi leader saddam hussein remained convinced that u.s forces lacked the capacity to wage more than a limited military campaign against his country saddam and his generals were well aware of past american failures such as the infamous black hawk down incident during the somali civil war saddam had also studied the conflict in vietnam and hoped to replicate the success of the north vietnamese by bogging down any invasion with defensive attractional warfare with graphic scenes of destruction plastered across american tv screens saddam expected popular opinion to quickly turn against the conflict until coalition forces withdrew in disgrace yet as we will see many factors conspired to doom the iraqi war effort long before the first shots were fired chief amongst these factors were saddam's legendary paranoia which made men like joseph stalin seem completely sane by comparison his direct preparations for the war were greatly surpassed by his efforts to completely lock down the iraqi populace pouring huge resources into the state security apparatus and surveillance programs many of the intelligence organizations that saddam created were in fact tasked primarily with spying on each other being late to the blame game was fatal and so these various agencies spent months merrily chasing phantoms and inventing elaborate conspiracy theories naturally the sentence for being accused in this web of lies and intrigue was always the same death predictably this insanity had a profound effect on the military readiness of the country saddam valued loyalty above all other traits and divided his forces into three groups based on their perceived trustworthiness these were the regular army the republican guard and finally the special republican guard or srg visits between officers of different army groups were forbidden and joint operations were unthinkable one srg commander recalled after the war we never coordinated with the republican guard i had no relation with any other units or fighting forces no other units were ever allowed near our unit no visits between other officers ever allowed in saddam's mind the only possible reason two officers of differing units would ever want to talk to each other would be to discuss a coup yet despite their highly dysfunctional leadership the average iraqi soldier strode into battle with a surprising degree of misplaced confidence for years the army was blasted with religious rhetoric promising that the infidel americans would soon fall before the sword of islam the prevailing attitude among the military was that the u.s was a paper tiger able to emit a terrifying war but incapable of enduring any serious losses since his successful coup in the late 1960s saddam hussein had ruled iraq at the head of the arab socialist baathist party which functioned as the central government and controlled all aspects of state policy given his unusually long reign an entire generation of iraqis had grown up having experienced nothing but saddam's dictatorship so few could imagine a world without their tyrannical leader exercising absolute power over their daily lives however despite saddam's oppression it is surprising how outright hostile the average iraqi citizen was towards their supposed american liberators for 12 years america was only ever known as the distant oppressor raining terror from the skies via airstrikes and subverting iraqi culture by funding insurrectionist movements meanwhile the few natives who benefited from western education experienced decades of villainization and dehumanization at the hands of the baathist party who painted them as traitors who sold out their own country for american petrodollars many iraqis were further distrustful of america after its behavior during the iran-iraq war when it had cheered saddam on as an indispensable ally in the middle east only to turn on his regime as soon as he threatened american interests in kuwait saddam's regime also possessed a natural heir of legitimacy thanks to his close ties to islam this was due to his extensive program of mosque building throughout iraq and decades spent manipulating his citizens into a state of unquestioning religious devotion even those muslims that hated their dictator still viewed his regime as inherently preferable to a democratic state especially one subject to degenerate western influences this was a concept that the u.s was simply unaccustomed to dealing with and led to many problems further down the line a second and arguably far more important factor that the u.s failed to consider was the ideological divide between the two major branches of islam the sunni and the shia the reigning baathist party consisted primarily of sunni muslims while the neighboring iran had undergone a revolution in 1979 that resulted in the creation of a shia controlled islamic republic fearful of a similar revolution in iraq saddam brutally oppressed his shia subjects excluding them from positions of authority and conducting mass executions whenever there was any hint of rebellion but such tyrannical measures while effective in the short term served only to stoke the fires of sectarian violence that would blaze out of control almost from the moment that u.s forces stepped across the border much of the chaos following the invasion could have been avoided had the invading coalition forces drafted a feasible plan for bringing stability in the wake of a regime change sadly this was not the case and civil disorder quickly became the order of the day with shia militant groups seeking vengeance on their former sunni oppressors troubles peaked in the capital city of baghdad which fell into a state of virtual anarchy following its capture shopkeeper muhammad abbas who had fled the city as the americans approached said when i got back to baghdad it was not the city i had left just a week before you saw people walking everywhere carrying looted goods nowhere could you see any sign of law and order no police no military no government nothing everything had collapsed the feelings of betrayal amongst the civilian population perhaps reached their peak after the al tabor raid in early 2004 when u.s forces entered and ransacked a mosque whose imam had recently begun preaching anti-american rhetoric and providing bomb-making lessons to would-be insurgents although a large cache of weapons and explosives were uncovered during the raid muslims across iraq were horrified by the images of the desecrated holy place with furniture smashed and copies of the sacred quran scattered across the floor to add insult to injury the americans offered no apology instead merely publishing a list of the seized items and brushing off the affair as just another routine operation against saddam's forces extremist clerics were quick to jump at this golden opportunity decrying the occupiers as devils whose sole purpose was to wage a war against the faithful of islam to aid this narrative terrorists and militia groups attacked coalition bases dressed as civilians forcing american soldiers to treat everyone as a potential threat this created a vicious cycle of mutual distrust each act of bad faith on one side triggering retaliation by the other which only led to further escalation given how volatile the situation was coalition forces quickly announced a provisional government to provide a peaceful transition to democracy but when the members of the new iraqi governing council were revealed the public was shocked to discover that it consisted of 13 shias and only 10 sunnis five of whom were kurdish minorities to the americans this was simply a matter of proportional representation after all the shias were the majority however to the sunni loyalists of iraq the site of the coalition raising up a government led by shiites and kurds was proof that saddam's anti-western rhetoric had been right all along the situation was not helped by the behavior of some opportunistic shia who quickly stepped in to fill the void left by their sunni counterparts to quote sunni government employee abu mustafa all of these senior officials had simply vanished and soon we began to see a new sectarian order people claiming to be doing the bidding of the shiite religious authorities began to fill the posts left open by the vanished bothists they began verbally abusing and firing sunnis or anyone they distrusted fortunately for america there was still one organization that had a solid plan for dealing with the rising tensions in iraq the cia in the aftermath of the invasion the cia was in charge of tracking down and capturing as many members of the former iraqi intelligence agencies as possible their efforts eventually succeeded when they rounded up a huge cabal of both party loyalists many of whom openly admitted to torture murder and various criminal activities having listened carefully to the various testimonies made against these men the cia quickly concluded that there was only one reasonable course of action to immediately offer them their jobs back and rebuild the core of saddam's police state from the ground up the cia rationalized this decision with the logic that under saddam terrorist activity in the region had been kept to a minimum and therefore there was nothing intrinsically wrong with his methods only his goals with all the worst aspects of the old regime now being restored by the very people claiming to be their liberators the iraqi people were finally pushed over the edge an explosion of violence rocked the nation and the capital city was divided up into warring sunni and shia suburbs the occupiers could do little but watch as chaos engulfed the nation their efforts to help constantly roadblocked by radicalism of their own inability to understand iraqi culture this bitterness and mistrust created an atmosphere where coalition soldiers saw danger around every corner the political vacuum left by saddam's defeat also allowed many extremist organizations to gain a significant foothold in the middle east turning the country into a war zone between government forces and radical militias by 2006 the violence had escalated into a full-scale civil war that saw the attempts of ethnic cleansing by both sunnis and shias resulting in the displacement of several million people to this day iraq remains one of the most unstable countries on earth with american forces being withdrawn in 2011 only to return in 2014 to combat the growing power of isis in the region faced with endless threats both external and internal the fragile democratic state now ruling the nation is constantly hamstrung by the meddling of foreign intelligence agencies and the deep bitter divisions amongst its populace but with isis finally losing its territory in the country in 2017 some still cling to the faint hope that iraq may finally be regaining its footing as a modern nation even so there is still much work left to be done you\",\n",
       " \" hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian with the british french and german empires all having extensive colonies in africa during the first world war it should come as no surprise that there was extensive fighting there although soldiers deployed in the african theater weren't subject to the same gruesome frontal charges and long months of trench warfare found in europe the soldiers fighting in africa had their own set of problems to contend with hostile terrain lack of infrastructure and a constant shortage of supplies made combat there uniquely prolonged miserable and

with considerably less enthusiasm than their countrymen back home while the territories claimed by europe's imperial powers appeared vast and menacing much of the land was only held in name with many native africans living in small remote communities still answering to their local kings and chiefs thus many colonial governors feared that being drawn into a global conflict would weaken or break their already tenuous hold over the continent at the beginning of the war many administrators and journalists in africa declared that the colonies should remain neutral and continue to cooperate with each other to consolidate their power in the region this commitment to neutrality was very powerful managing to last a whole one week before france and britain ordered their colonial armies to start invading german colonies the first shots were fired by the french invading german cameroon on august 6th the next day allied forces invaded togoland and german forces in east africa began raiding nearby colonies while togoland would surrender in only three weeks with minimal resistance the defenders of cameroon put up a stubborn fight no british and french forces were able to quickly occupy much of the colony the mountainous terrain of central cameroon proved highly defensible letting the germans hold back the allied forces for more than a year repelling assault after assault on the provisional capital of yaounde meanwhile in response to german raids the british began to prepare an amphibious invasion of german east africa beginning with the capture of the port of tonga in november tonga was sparsely defended and so the allies expected an easy victory but their efforts would be complicated by fierce enemy resistance and of all things bees more on that later not long after the fighting broke out in the northwest the british union of south africa mobilized its forces for what should have been a quick and easy invasion of german southwest africa the south african army outnumbered the german garrison 20-1 and on september 14th they invaded and rapidly began to occupy the german colony however the british rulers of south africa soon found their efforts complicated as always by the boers descendants of dutch settlers in the region the boers had long resented british rule in the region and tensions between the two groups were high on the day after the invasion began a boer politician and former general of the second boer war quotes de la rey was unlawfully shot dead by a british policeman at a roadblock in response one of the commanding officers leading the invasion of southwest africa lieutenant colonel monte moritz defected leading the soldiers under his command in a rebellion against the british south african government the rebellion threw the south african army into disarray and command was turned over to general jan smutz a seasoned british officer in hopes that he could restore order smotes declared martial law in south africa and halted the invasion order to deal with the rebellion the process of putting down the uprising and rounding up war rebels capped smoot occupied for the rest of 1914 giving the small german garrison precious time to regroup meanwhile north of the sahara all territory seemed to be held firmly in the hands of the ontant and neutral italians but the absence of german colonies did not protect north africa from the influence of the great war the diversion of troops to the western front left european colonies in north africa vulnerable to rebellions which the german and ottoman empires were more than happy to aid in the french protectorate of morocco fighting was already ongoing between colonial forces and the zain confederation an alliance of berber tribes that opposed french attempts to consolidate power in the middle atlas mountains most of the troops in morocco had been recalled to defend france and so the remaining forces there had to be stretched dangerously thin across the french line to hide this sudden vulnerability while one hot-headed officer nearly doomed the french defense by marching off and getting his force annihilated in november the zayans never committed to an organized offensive and the fragile french line managed to hold on for the rest of the war nearing the end of 1914 the british launched their invasion of german east africa their first target was the port city of tonga on paper capturing the city should have been easy the british brought four thousand men to battle compared to the german garrison of only 250 conscripts however the british blundered at nearly every stage of the battle first commander arthur aiken made the chivalrous decision to announce himself to the germans and give them an hour to surrender the city before even landing his troops giving german general paul von letoff vorbeck plenty of time to rush to tonga with 750 reinforcements perhaps hoping to make up for lost time aiken ordered his troops to attack as soon as they hit the shore despite their exhaustion after the long journey all the way from india while the british seemingly did everything in their power to lose their own battle the germans also helped taking the attackers by surprise with their well-concealed and fortified defensive positions additionally mother nature contributed to the british defeat sending swarms of agitated bees into the fighting even after 5 000 additional troops arrived to reinforce the flagging assault the men were continually plagued by poor morale and after suffering nearly 1 000 casualties they were forced to retreat from tonga the germans barely suffered 100 casualties and were able to loot plenty of medical supplies equipment and maxim guns from their defeated foes effectively supplying them for the rest of the campaign tonga was later described by historian charles hordern as one of the most notable failures in british military history and it effectively halted the invasion of east africa for the following year as 1915 began fighting continued to rage in cameroon and french troops continued to unsuccessfully besiege the capital while british forces were bogged down in the north by the stubborn resistance of two german strongholds known as mora and garwah these old-fashioned stone fortresses long since rendered obsolete in europe were still extremely effective in the underdeveloped landscape of cameroon where heavy artillery was unavailable down in southwest africa the tiny german garrison took advantage of the chaos caused by the moritz rebellion to turn the tables on the south african army they routed the small occupying garrison and reclaimed their captured territory and in february a small german force invaded south africa and attempted to gain control of two fords at the orange river this daring german attack was repelled and one week later the south africans resumed their invasion with the full attention of the massive south african army at last the germans were forced into a rapid retreat and surrendered on july 9th in november the british protectorate of egypt was taken by surprise when the sinusi order a secretive religious order based in libya invaded with ten thousand men and modern weapons provided by the ottoman empire the sinuses quickly gained ground in egypt and attempted to rally the local muslim population to join them against the british unfortunately for the would-be holy warriors local support failed to materialize and the british soon began pushing back the invasion skirmishes along the border would continue for years but the bulk of the sunusi army was decisively defeated at the battle of egelja around the same time the staunch german resistance in cameroon was finally starting to collapse and british and french forces were closing in on the capital seeing the writing on the wall german commander carl zimmerman ordered all german soldiers and civilians to abandon cameroon and retreat to the neighboring spanish colony of rio muni zimmerman's retreat functionally ended the campaign at which time britain and france agreed on terms to divide up cameroon amongst themselves after the conclusion of this campaign the british turned their attention to east africa and it's now infamous commander paul von letoff vorbeck in january 1916 general jan smotes was reassigned from the south and given an army of 20 000 men to finally conquer german east africa this was a massive force for the african theater requiring hundreds of thousands of african porters to carry weapons ammunition and other vital supplies through the harsh landscape of east africa the british army then launched their second invasion of german east africa in february joined by a belgian force coming from the congo in the west much like in cameroon and togoland the germans quickly lost ground against the more numerous invaders but let off four back was determined to make the allies pay dearly for every mile using the thick brush and forests as cover he launched repeated hit and run ambushes against the british as he withdrew slowly whittling down their forces these raids were successful in harassing the allied armies and slowing them down giving tropical diseases all the more time to wreak havoc on the commonwealth forces the invasion dragged on this way for the rest of 1916 with attrition devastating the british force as they slowly trudged further and further into east africa rather than abandon this costly campaign the british chose to make up their losses with more and more african conscripts by the beginning of 1917 more than half of the british army in east africa consisted of local african troops forcibly recruited from across the continent to shore up the faltering offensive as for letoff for back he continued his fighting retreat all the way through 1917 consistently avoiding british attempts to encircle his dwindling army by november the germans had been pushed all the way back to the rivuma river the southern border of the colony and were low on supplies and ammunition rather than surrender let off four back chose to cross the river and invade the poorly defended portuguese colony of mozambique while the allies were able to fully occupy german east africa the german army continued to make a nuisance of itself in the portuguese colony for nine months raiding and pillaging it for supplies in august 1918 they finally returned to their colony and began to retake lost territory from the pitifully small british garrisons now defending it this fighting continued until november when let off four back finally surrendered upon hearing word that an armistice had been signed and the german empire had lost the war all told the war in africa claimed the lives of far fewer soldiers than it did in europe the allies suffered around 42 000 military casualties while the germans suffered around 21 000 the civilian cost was much much higher it's estimated that over 1 million africans were conscripted as porters to support the campaign and more than 100 000 died this caused severe depopulation of many regions for example 45 000 porters were recruited from kenya amounting to 13 of the male population combined with the constant rating and requisitioning a polite word for raiding of local crops and cattle by both sides the european campaigns led to a massive famine in east africa in 1917 which claimed another 300 000 civilian lives as is so often the case the price of war in africa was paid most heavily by these civilians germany's colonies in the region were seized and divided up between britain and france along arbitrary lines even so the first world war was the first time that cracks began to show in the facade of european invincibility paving the way for uprisings against colonial rule these cracks would only continue to grow over the years to come before the whole structure of colonialism finally collapsed after the second world [Music] war\",\n",

president herbert hoover signed the 1930 smoot hawley tariff act which raised customs duties to such an extent that imported goods became unaffordable to all but the wealthiest americans instead of spurring domestic purchasing and production as intended the smoot-hawley tariffs succeeded only in further damaging the world's economy as other nations passed retaliatory tariffs against american exports international trade plummeted by 65 percent leading to the full collapse of banks in america and europe as the world economy only increased its tailspin when franklin delano roosevelt became president in 1933 he immediately set about implementing his new deal program to strengthen america's economy and get people back to work he insured americans bank accounts through the federal deposit insurance corporation or fdic implemented the social security program to provide income to the disabled and elderly and brought thousands onto the federal payroll through public works projects while these programs certainly benefited countless americans the effects of roosevelt's new deal paled in comparison to those of america joining the second world war with the sleeping giant awakened the united states saw a tectonic shift in economic activity between the draft and the industrial sector experiencing a massive demand for new laborers to produce more materiel unemployment plummeted overnight america's women also stepped into the breach taking jobs traditionally reserved for men government contracts and investment spurred continued growth and america's economy roared back to life through victory in 1945 [Music] arguably the dropping of the atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki marked a new chapter in american history the isolationist america of old perished in the nuclear holocaust that ended the second world war the united states was the only allied country to emerge from the war with her economy not only intact but thriving as government contracts ended and subsidies were withdrawn private investment took their place consumers were able to purchase goods and appliances that had long been outside of their economic reach and they used their new economic power to spur more and more spending and growth this transition from a war economy to a consumerist one was the bedrock of america's post-war preeminence but none of it would be possible without the influx of working age men coming home from the war ready to start their new lives in this revitalized country returning gis stepped off their boats planes and trains to find an america totally different from the one they had left many would remember the mistreatment their fathers and grandfathers had endured after the first world war when they were given a pittance of a bonus and a train fair home but things would be different this time the gi bill of rights was signed into law by president roosevelt in 1944 and promised myriad benefits to returning veterans from federal guarantees on home loans to subsidized university or vocational education between 1944 and 1956 7.8 million veterans went to college or trade schools with gi bill subsidies while 2.4 million home loans were guaranteed by the veterans administration these loans were used to buy houses in the newly built suburbs where a plethora of new single-family homes drew people from the cities to these new developments this was the start of american car culture and the suburban population began commuting from their new homes to their new jobs in the cities on the new interstate highway system life was good in the new america but there were many excluded from this newfound prosperity black veterans faced a brand new war on the home front their first battle was obtaining gi benefits one of the key compromises that ensured the original law's passing was the condition that aid be administered by state governments rather than a federal agency this meant that segregationist jim crow laws overshadowed the promises of the gi bill and aid was often contingent on skin color separate but unequal schools set what few black veterans were able to use their benefits up for failure while the majority were simply intimidated into never collecting what they were do black unemployment was also endemic throughout the 1950s and 1960s with what work that was available paying only the smallest of wages and offering no chance for upward mobility america's women found themselves in a battle of their own hired in droves to fill the factories and provide support for the armed services in the minds of many the end of the war meant the end of rosie the riveter they were laid off on mass from their wartime jobs to make way for returning servicemen and those who were kept on the payroll were placed in part-time clerical jobs with no union protections women in uniform were denied gi bill benefits outright and magazines began running ads and opinion pieces designed to pressure america's women to leave the workforce and settle down as homemakers this was the dawn of the nuclear family and the beginning of the baby boom and america asked its women to do a different kind of duty with its domestic house in order the united states began to make changes abroad as well in july of 1944 the united states invited representatives of the allied nations to bretton woods new hampshire where the u.s treasury department proposed an international bank and trade control network to promote worldwide cooperation and prevent the economic brinkmanship that led the world to war and with that the international monetary fund was born but this was only a preamble to a much greater effort at american international influence president roosevelt believed the world needed a strong international body to prevent future conflict and such a body would need strong leadership in his view american leadership roosevelt gathered representatives of the united states united kingdom soviet union and republic of china at dumbarton oaks a historic residence outside of washington d.c and from august to october of 1944 they laid the groundwork for the united nations one year later on october 24th 1945 the u.n was officially established in san francisco honoring the wishes of his predecessor president harry s truman personally signed the u.s charter for the united states and pressured congress to ratify it but america had more than economic and political means to promote her interests the u.s never truly demobilized and she was unafraid to use her military might or shadowy intelligence service to spread her influence the only roadblock to that influence in america's view was communism the soviets had already reorganized much of eastern europe after the war and were busy converting these new socialist republics into buffers between them and the rest of the world through investment in the marshall plan and propaganda coups like the berlin airlift america sought to combat soviet influence on the pr front while simultaneously putting her thumb on the scales of elections in the newly created post-war states and elsewhere on the asian front america was busy rebuilding the shattered empire of japan into a bulwark against the red spread in east asia on september 8th 1951 the empire of japan and the united states signed the treaty of san francisco which officially ended the state of war between japan and the us one of the core tenants of the treaty was japan's total disarmament with japan seeding land and resources for the establishment of american garrisons some of which still stand today japan submitted to the u.s military government and the americans were quick to punish the former empire for its pre-war militarism demobilized officers of the imperial army were barred from certain occupations such as government service while the wealthy landowners who supported the war had their property seized by the americans and redistributed to tenant farmers but america had more discreet ways of getting what she wanted throughout the 1950s and 60s the cia undertook a bevy of covert operations throughout the world in support of american foreign policy the cia fermented supported or outright incited numerous coups and regime changes throughout the post-war years american support for the vehemently anti-communist regimes of south korea and south vietnam is well known but cia-backed revolutions also occurred in iran in 1953 and guatemala in 1954 among many others worldwide the 1953 iranian coup saw the cia install shah muhammad raza palavi the cia accomplished this by bribing among others iranian clergy who spoke out against the previous government these same clergy who would go on to speak out against the shah pulavi and incite the iranian revolution of the 1970s the 1954 guatemalaku saw both the cia and the us ambassador to guatemala john purifoy support and direct a military overthrow of guatemala's democratically elected government in favor of a hard-line anti-communist dictatorship under president castillo armas while the cia would come to judge the armas regime as inept despite holding near absolute power the heads of the agency quietly congratulated each other on a job well done this was reflective of the cia's modus operandi the suppression of democracy to ensure the suppression of communism between the areas occupied by her military and her existing possessions america emerged from the second world war a territorial giant the u.s established an empire spanning from alaska to hawaii from berlin to tokyo with her economic growth sudden territorial breadth and willingness to use any means to ensure her position america had cemented itself as the new superpower on the proverbial block the eagle had [Music] landed america was forever changed by the second world war spared the chaos and destruction of fighting on her own soil america was able to take her war economy into the post-war world becoming a manufacturing juggernaut and calling the tune of international trade the gi bill created an educated middle class but its unequal implementation left both black and female veterans to fend for themselves in the resurgent united states and with clandestine efforts all around the globe america was able to affect regime change wherever it deemed necessary overturning elections and installing sympathetic governments to further her foreign policy goals america had become an empire to dwarf any throughout history\",\n",

johnson the armchair historian today's video is on the amphibious invasion of sicily when the plan was first proposed by prime minister winston churchill and the british chiefs of staff it was met with astonishment this was the first large-scale offensive operation aimed at the european mainland since the fall of france in 1940 and despite the axis losing hundreds of thousands of troops in its last stand in north africa they were far from beaten supplies in the mediterranean theater were scarce and the idea of a new large-scale offensive seemed ludicrous to many american generals naturally argued that an invasion of italy at this time would draw resources away from cross-channel operations into france something that the soviets had been demanding for months debate raged throughout the two-week conference at casablanca with churchill's stirring rhetoric about italy being the soft underbelly of europe eventually persuading the americans to consider his proposal thus operation husky was born a large-scale amphibious invasion from north africa to the island of sicily which could be used as a springboard for a subsequent attack on mainland italy general dwight d eisenhower was appointed supreme commander of operation husky but planning remained primarily in the hands of british general harold alexander general alexander's plan of attack was simple land on the southern tip of sicily and capture the large port of syracuse then drive north to cut off an axis retreat at messina which was also a logistical staging point for any future invasion of italy the british would take center stage in the assault with the american forces operating in a supporting role something they weren't particularly happy about to reach syracuse the allies would need to cross the ponte grande bridge over the river anako but given its strategic importance the italians undoubtedly prepared to destroy the bridge at first sign of invasion left with no other options general alexander authorized a risky airborne operation to capture the bridge ahead of the main invasion on the night of july 9th 1943 a large formation of gliders and transport planes entered axis airspace over the isle of sicily but with winds gusting at over 45 miles or 72 kilometers an hour the ambitious airborne assault quickly turned into a confused mess anti-aircraft batteries and searchlights added to the chaos leading to 65 of the 147 gliders being released prematurely by their towing aircraft many of which plunged straight into the ocean of the remainder only 12 landed near their objectives and the rest were scattered far and wide across the sicilian countryside had the axis forces been better prepared operation husky might now be considered one of the biggest disasters of the second world war but many factors transpired to give the allies an easier time than they arguably deserved sicily was defended by the entire italian sixth army backed up by several german divisions amounting to over 300 000 men accompanied by several hundred tanks and over a thousand aircraft but italian morale was at an all-time low following the loss of north africa and the bulk of the sixth army was made up of coastal and support divisions that had minimal combat experience and little incentive to stand and fight furthermore senior italian general alfredo guzani and german field marshal albert kesselring were constantly at odds over every detail of the defense thanks to this bickering and the loss of north africa the remaining german soldiers in sicily had grown to despise their italian counterparts and now refused to coordinate with them the tentative nature of the axis hold on sicily was plainly illustrated when a ragged group of 50 british paratroopers made their way to ponte grande bridge after scrounging up a meager handful of supplies with no expectations of success the men fired off a few half-hearted volleys at the entrenched defenders only to watch in astonishment as the terrified italians leapt from their bunkers and vanished into the night scenes like this were repeated across the island with paratroopers causing havoc by cutting telephone wires intercepting message couriers and attacking isolated coastal batteries as the next day dawned a fleet of transport ships made a daring rush through high seas towards the sicilian coastline lining their decks were the men of the us seventh army under george patton and the british 8th army under bernard montgomery once again the treacherous winds and natural obstacles such as offshore sand bars were as dangerous as enemy fire with several landing ships running aground or finding themselves blown helplessly off course however as previously stated enemy resistance was remarkably light with no significant force awaiting the allies on the beaches with no tanks or mobile infantry divisions to contest the landings the static defenses proved only temporary inconveniences when the confused and dispirited italian forces finally began to mobilize for a counter-attack on the beachheads they were easily repulsed by naval gunfire with approximately 53 000 men put ashore in the first wave the allies began their advance inland although puente grande bridge had already been recaptured by the italians the paratroopers held it long enough to delay the axis forces to destroy it and syracuse fell within a day by the 12th much of southern sicily was in allied hands the luftwaffe was being suppressed by strategic bombing raids and many allied officers were already preparing to celebrate a swift victory but then disaster almost struck when the british attempted a second major airborne operation to capture a bridge over the river cemento which blocked their northern advance towards the city of catania while the initial attack was successful the bridge was deep behind enemy lines and the isolated paratroopers had to hold out for three whole days before ground units could relieve them even after the bridge was secured fierce italian resistance stalled the advance into the northern half of the island for another week sicily would not be an easy victory after all with delays mounting friction developed between the two halves of the invasion force the american seventh army had been intended to provide support from the flanks but was otherwise expected to hang back while the british eighth army did most of the fighting to say this situation was not to general patton's liking would be a vast understatement so he began badgering general alexander for permission to break out to the western side of the island unable to endure patton's pestering alexander reluctantly mumbled that patton could conduct a limited reconnaissance mission naturally patton interpreted this as permission to charge the entire seventh army west at breakneck speed leaving montgomery to continue trudging north in the face of increasingly stiff enemy resistance while patton was busy crushing the remnants of the italian army stationed in western sicily field marshal kesselring was preparing his final defensive line in the mountainous terrain south of messina this was known as the aetna line as it included the giant volcano mount aetna as one of its key defensive components both sides knew that whoever controlled the mountain slopes could decide the course of the battle and fighting in the area was intense montgomery planned to capture the town of adrano which linked the two halves of the aetna line together around the base of the volcano but adreno was still well behind enemy lines and to get there the allies had to battle their way through some of the harshest terrain since the deserts of north africa the first major clash on the road to mount aetna occurred at the town of chen turipe situated atop a line of extremely steep hills that gave a commanding view of the surrounding countryside and provided a nearly impregnable defensive position for the elite german falsehood or paratrooper regiment stationed there on august 2nd a heavy artillery barrage managed to destroy or dislodge the defenders from several of their hilltop fortifications but chen to repay itself remained defiant left with no other choice the men of the british 78th infantry division pushed forwards across broken rocky terrain constantly being hit by mortar fire and german snipers entering the town the battered infantrymen found themselves confronted by a pair of panzer 3s that had been hidden in the narrow streets with no armored support of their own the men of the 78th played hide and seek with these deadly opponents finally surrounding and destroying them with piatt anti-tank weapons yet even without their tanks the outnumbered falsehoods held out for two whole days as the british were sweating up the steep hills around shen turipe general patton had finished rolling up the western half of sicily and was now assaulting the town of tronia which was also part of the aetna line once again the extreme terrain made for a difficult advance with extensive minefields making the unsteady ground even more treacherous to patton's great annoyance his forces were unable to achieve any easy breakthroughs and had to settle into an arduous routine of slowly prying the enemy off their fortified hilltops one by one the german and italian forces were not content to simply hold the line either launching numerous counter-attacks that often managed to regain ground and re-occupy old positions the assault ontrania lasted until august 6th and just like chen turipe the allies were unable to prevent the germans from making an orderly withdrawal that same day adreno was occupied by the 78th division and just like that the aetna line was finally broken and the end of the campaign was in sight in fact axis forces were already in the process of evacuating from sicily castle ring was under no illusions about his chances of holding the island for much longer and had little reason to stand and fight after the loss of catania and its airfields on the fifth beginning on august 11th a massive fleet of transport ships assembled at the port of messina right at the northern tip of sicily with rear guard units delaying the allied advance more than 100 000 german and italian soldiers were able to cross the straits of messina and escape into italy despite the fierce fighting the battle for sicily had been a remarkably bloodless affair of the nearly 500 000 allied soldiers involved only one percent were killed in action the germans lost about 26 000 men with 10 000 taken captive and the rest killed or wounded almost the entire italian sixth army surrendered and one hundred thousand men became prisoners of war the invasion also convinced italy's grand council of fascism to capitulate and by the middle of july they voted mussolini out of power and began seeking terms of surrender for an instant it seemed as if churchill had been correct and the soft underbelly of europe was about to be laid open with a single decisive strike but instead the allies had unknowingly committed themselves to an agonizing slog up the italian peninsula where thousands of lives would be wasted in pursuit of a quick victory that would never materialize join us next time when we take a look at this final campaign in italy which lasted right up until the final axis surrender in may of 1945 it is late january 1944 and just south of monty casino the men of the 36th infantry division are attempting to secure a bridgehead over the gauri river enemy fire is intense with german artillery saturating the area in a relentless deafening barrage despite enormous losses two regiments have made the crossing but now they are trapped their landing craft reduced to splinters by this ceaseless bombardment back on the opposite shore major general fred walker watches the disaster unfold through his binoculars a veteran of the great war he knows an impossible situation when he sees one glancing backwards at the one remaining regiment under his command he debates ordering them forward but after a moment he dismisses the idea even if a miracle happens and this river is taken the cycle will just repeat at the next one sighing to himself he wonders how anyone could have been foolish enough to envision italy as the soft underbelly of europe hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian in today's video we'll be continuing our look at the italian campaign in the second world war last time we covered the invasion of sicily which gave the allies a springboard to launch an attack on the mainland in the wake of defeat morale plummeted and the italian fascist party was in an uproar over mussolini's inability to deal with the situation on the 24th of july 1943 just 15 days after the landings in sicily the party undertook its first and only democratic vote to depose its leader disband the party and sue for peace this vote passed 19 to 8 and a loudly protesting mussolini was promptly carted off to prison aware that germany would never allow it to peacefully surrender the new italian government dramatically announced that it had every intention of fighting to the bitter end before immediately opening secret negotiations with the allies with this game of chess between italy and the allies seemingly coming to a conclusion after the abrupt realization that mussolini only really knew how to play checkers a single handshake would end the game before it reached the italian countryside but no such handshake would happen as 16 new german divisions crossed the alps into northern italy spoiling for a rematch but the allies were not deterred as far in the east joseph stalin remained insistent that the allies maintain pressure on the western front and divert as many axis forces as possible away from the soviet union thus the second match began on september 3rd when soldiers of the british 8th army dashed across the straits of messina this was intended as a diversion from the real landings scheduled to take place a week later but albert kesselring the general in charge of the german troops stationed in italy was no fool and simply ordered the men stationed in the area to retreat and consolidate their positions further north denied battle the frustrated british advanced at a snail's pace delayed by minefields roadblocks and collapsed bridges a few days later a second british operation took place this time aimed at taking the report of taranto and establishing a supply base for the eighth army again the initial landings went unopposed as british forces established control over the south of the country news of the italian surrender was made public and the situation promptly took a turn for the worse on hitler's orders german forces undertook operation aksa quickly disarming the remainder of the italian military while a few divisions chose to resist the majority either meekly surrendered or agreed to fight alongside their new occupiers the new italian government fled rome which was occupied on the 10th and mussolini found himself thrust back into the international spotlight at the head of a new puppet state the italian socialist republic with italy controlled by nazi germany there was no hope of a swift victory and the stage was set for the prolonged bloody conflict that would follow despite this setback many allied planners remained optimistic holding on to the dream of a lightning campaign to liberate the peninsula the minimal resistance encountered by the british led to the belief that the germans were still preoccupied dealing with the italian army and lack either the will or the manpower to defend territory south of rome so on the 9th of september the allies commenced operation avalanche with a total of 9 divisions from the us fifth army launching from staging points on sicily and heading straight for a roughly 35 mile or 56 kilometer stretch of italian coastline near the port of salerno at this point in time the fifth army was a combined force of both british and american troops the former were to land in the north near salerno itself while the latter were directed further south from the start the landings were severely mismanaged with historians arguing to this day over who deserves the most blame for the ensuing fiasco despite strenuous protests from the leader of the naval task force admiral kent hewitt the american landing zones were not subjected to a preliminary bombardment this was due to the mistaken assumption that the operation had the element of surprise despite sightings of luftwaffe reconnaissance planes over the task force as it crossed from sicily predictably kessel ring had guessed the american plan of action and positioned his troops to contest the landings left with no alternative the men of the fifth army waded ashore under intense bombardment from machine guns field artillery and panzers the beaches quickly turned into a slaughterhouse and for a brief moment the fate of the entire campaign hung in the balance then the guns of the naval task force finally opened up blasting gaps in the temporary german fortifications and opening the way for the beleaguered troops to rush through and establish a beachhead [Music] but this was by no means an end to the carnage as the entire 16th panzer division then thundered down from the hills to continue the onslaught during the frantic fighting that ensued naval gunfire again proved decisive with the cruiser and destroyer escorts engaging a minimum of 130 shore bound targets during the first day alone further north the british divisions had faced somewhat lighter resistance and had only gone ashore after their escort ships had spent 15 minutes softening up the german defenses after pushing inland they were able to capture a vital airfield and a force of sas commandos and us army rangers entered salerno itself and drove out the defenders after a brief bout of street fighting but the situation was still dire and german counter-attacks were relentless the luftwaffe also conducted many sorties against both the beachheads and the naval task force sinking approximately 100 landing craft of various sizes and damaging various warships after another six days kesselring was forced to retreat on direct orders from high command hitler had conferred with erwin rommel and both men had agreed it was pointless to try and defend southern italy although they had very nearly succeeded in throwing the fifth army back into the sea german losses had been heavy especially among the precious panzer divisions but these losses were not crippling and the rough italian countryside presented many opportunities for the germans to make life hell for the allies as they pushed up the peninsula having been battered almost to the point of breaking the weary men of the fifth army were reluctant to drive north after their retreating enemies morale was extremely low and as a result the decision was made to delay the push on rome until october in the meantime allied forces concentrated on consolidating their hold on southern italy and capturing the airfields located on the companion planes while this was ongoing the civilian population of naples rose in an unexpected revolt creating enough chaos for the allies to force a german retreat from the area on october 3rd the sas conducted a daring amphibious assault on the city of tirmoli part of the first defensive line south of rome this was known as the voltorno line and ran parallel to two large rivers the raid was a remarkable success with the commando team seizing the city and holding it until being reinforced by the commonwealth faith army however the river crossings were delayed by the need to build bridges capable of withstanding the weight of allied tanks as the engineers got to work the 16th panzer division struck again further impeding construction efforts and inflicting significant casualties but the two allied armies pressed on reaching the second line of german defenses in late october known as the barbara line once again the rough terrain proved as big an obstacle as enemy fire and it was only on the 9th of november that a significant breakthrough was finally made by this point about three months had passed since combat operations started in italy and all hopes for a lightning campaign to liberate the peninsula had been dashed miles of barbed wire fortified machine gun pits camouflaged bunkers and extensive minefields now lay in wait for the two advancing armies all located in some of mainland europe's roughest terrain with winter rapidly closing in the allies had little time to prepare for their assaults on kesselring's masterpiece an innovator in both military tactics and apparently chess the gambit we've named after the german general includes distracting your opponent and quickly switching out all of your pawns for castles on the 1st of december the first probing attacks began in the west made against a large bulge in the german defenses known as the beren heart line conditions were terrible with freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall making for an agonizing trek for the soldiers as they struggled their way through hostile terrain after several weeks of intermittent engagements the allies were only able to wrestle a number of small villages away from enemy control in the end it was the germans who decided to withdraw falling back to the more tenable gustav line in early january of 1944 while the fifth army was busy dying in the snow the eighth army also found itself preoccupied with well dying in the snow the 8th had attacked the gustav line on the 4th of december and made significant headway but then the germans made a strategic withdrawal through a deep gully which funneled the commonwealth forces into a carefully prepared killing ground any unit entering the guli was brutally mauled and allied progress was completely stalled until german forces withdrew to a new position on the 20th the next set of battles for the gustav line took place at the towns of ortona and orsonia the former proved an absolute nightmare for the canadian units assigned to capture it as they were forced to engage in some of the bloodiest street fighting on the western front the german parachute battalion defending the town had dug in deep and had to be fought from building to building in a protracted struggle that resulted in roughly 4 500 casualties altogether decimating both the first canadian division as well as the civilian population or sonia meanwhile resisted every attack holding out until a massive blizzard struck the adriatic coastline and forced the british to halt their offensive but even this could not end the bloodshed for long and on january 14th the two allied armies launched yet another series of attacks on the line starting the notorious battle for monty casino the first assault was conducted by the british and resulted in little more than three days of pointless slaughter two more attacks failed due to either terrain or a lack of armored support and a fourth ended with minor gains that were promptly abandoned due to the lack of supplies after these repeated failures the allies authorized operation avenger which fixated on the monty casino abbey as the linchpin of german defenses in the area on february 15th a huge bomber raid reduced the abbey to a smoldering pile of rubble unfortunately the raid was badly coordinated and was not followed up by a ground assault so in the end little was accomplished while this was ongoing the allies had also conducted a naval landing near the city of ancio to outflank the gustav line but after landing relatively unopposed general john p lucas made the inexplicable decision to dig in and fortify his position rather than push inland kessel ring promptly wheeled his reserves about and smashed into the beachhead beginning a long battle of attrition that would last until may meanwhile the third battle for casino began on march 15th with a creeping barrage that disordered the german line but this ray of hope was quickly snuffed out by heavy rains giving the germans time to prepare however by now it was clear that the axis was losing the battle of attrition and the final breakthrough came on may 11th when both the eighth and fifth armies attacked at once aided by the french expeditionary corps and even some polish forces this last tremendous push finally fractured the gustav line which held for nearly six months but although the main line of axis defenses had been breached there was still much to be done and the push north continued a breakout was also staged at ancio with the help of an artillery bombardment and close air support in danger of becoming encircled kesselring received orders to fall back but right at the pivotal moment general mark clark decided to ignore orders to pursue the german army and instead drove towards rome unable to believe his luck a delighted kessel rang quickly pulled back to yet another set of defensive works codenamed the gothic line after so much blood had been shed the actual capture of rome was something of an anti-climax with german attention turning towards the inevitable invasion of france the city had all but been abandoned after a few brief skirmishes rome was liberated on june 4th just two days prior to the landings in normandy getting there had required six hundred thousand allied troops over one hundred thousand of which had become casualties since the day they first landed in italy but despite their grievous losses there was little time to rest and recuperate kessel ring had proven a genius at defensive warfare and leaving him to his own devices would undoubtedly prove disastrous thus british and american armies raced up the coast only to be checked yet again at the improvised traci mene line encountered on june 20th stalled for another week the germans had ample time to move the bulk of its army to the aponine mountains infuriated but impotent the allies could do nothing but resign themselves to yet another long riding siege on august 25th the allies launched operation olive aimed at breaching the gothic line and finally ending the seemingly eternal battle for italy the eighth army was to attack german positions along the adriatic coast and when castle ring had committed his reserves to that area mark clark's fifth army would strike at the weakened center breaking through to bologna initial progress was good but kesselring continued to pull his old tricks and refused to be lured into fighting on unequal terms by the end of september the allies had clambered their way over the peaks of the apennine mountains having suffered 14 000 casualties then autumn reigns stalled further attacks grounding air support and turning vital supply routes into impassable quagmires at this point the remainder of 1944 would be spent in a deadlock with a single axis counter attack in december managing to briefly reoccupy a section of the gothic line although castle ring had done a spectacular job in italy his position was about to change drastically he was severely injured in a car crash in october and upon his recovery found himself replacing field marshal gert von roenstedt as commander of the entire western front on march 10th even he could do nothing but watch the final collapse of the third reich as allied troops were already pouring into germany itself in spring of 1945 the allies launched their final offensive in italy operation grapeshot during the months-long stalemate the fifth and eighth armies had been reinforced by a diverse collection of units from various nations including several thousand british trained italian volunteers and even a division from the brazilian expeditionary force the attack began on april 6th with a long artillery bombardment then attacks all along the line by commonwealth troops without any reserves left the germans could no longer do anything but desperately try to hold the line however the situation was hopeless by the 20th of april the two allied armies had broken into the po valley and only five days later mussolini was dragged out of hiding by italian partisans and summarily executed with no reason left to fight kessel castlerang's replacement opened up negotiations with the allies and signed a surrender order on may 2nd just a few days before the official end of the war in europe after so many gambits and clever plays the chessboard of italy had been cleared the final handshake between players would occur at last a year and a half after the start of their unexpected rematch in many ways the italian campaign showcased both the best and worst moments from the second world war the idea to divert forces from the eastern front was sound but internal division quickly turned the campaign into an unfocused mess supplies were diverted to other operations and arguments among allied generals led to missed opportunities and long delays kessel ring also demonstrated exactly how deadly the vermont could be on the defense holding out for over a year against a much greater force which by that point possessed total air superiority but the battles in italy kept hundreds of thousands of german soldiers occupied at a time when manpower was critically low and the experience gained from the amphibious landings at salerno proved invaluable to the planners of d-day still historians remained divided on the campaign with many arguing that it was an outright strategic failure but others see it as part of a bigger picture a necessary even vital component to the fall of the axis powers into the liberation of europe you\",\n",

supporting the armchair historian and armchair history tv after the inconclusive battle of balaclava russian strategists believed that their enemy's supply lines were overextended and vulnerable to attack on november 5th the russians gathered a force of 42 000 men to assault the british near the village of inckerman with the goal of breaking through their defenses before reinforcements could arrive advancing in the early hours of the morning the attackers were hidden by a thick fog as they approached the british defenses at a hill called home ridge the french and british defenders on and around homebridge numbered only around 13 000 less than a third of the size of the russian army bearing down on them fighting began at dawn when the russian general fedor soimanov sent around 15 000 men to assault the ridge which in the early stages of battle was defended by just 2700 men of the british second division however british forward defenses in the valley did catch sight of the russians advancing through the fog and opened fire alerting the men of the second division to attack but due to this fog the defenders on holmridge had no idea how outnumbered they truly were emboldened by their ignorance the acting commander of the second division major general john pennyfeather ordered the entire force to advance down the hill and meet the russians head-on the russians attempted to soften up the defenders by bombarding homridge with artillery however they didn't realize that the second division was no longer on the hill they didn't become aware of the impending counter-attack until the british soldiers emerged from the fog right in front of them and fighting began almost immediately the russians attempted to break through on the second division's left flank but were pushed back they're outdated flintlock muskets completely outmatched by the british enfield percussion lock rifles in the fighting that followed soymentoff the russian general was killed and swiftly replaced by another officer who was then promptly shot and killed too followed by a third commander who survived for a few minutes and then was killed too at this point the remaining russian officers were understandably reluctant to take charge and so promptly withdrew to regroup as british reinforcements poured in once a second column of russian troops arrived in assistance the tsar's men shifted their focus to the northeast where the british had set up a defensive wall called the barrier fifteen thousand men advanced on the barrier which was being held by only 300 troops channeling their inner spartans these 300 men fixed bayonets and vaulted over the wall to charge at the russian army with the fog still hampering visibility on both sides the bayonet charge caused enough confusion among the russians to halt their advance giving enough time for reinforcements to arrive and attack the russians flank forcing them to withdraw still not knowing exactly what was going on the imperial russian army gathered up for one final push on home ridge the fighting was fierce and hectic with the dense haze forcing many units on both sides to act completely on their own initiative cut off from their allies which would eventually earn the battle of anchorman the nickname the soldier's battle just as the british defenders began to falter the timely arrival of french reinforcements allowed them to hold back the russians and ultimately drive them away from home ridge bringing the battle to an end at the end of the day approximately one-third of the allied and russian soldiers fighting in the battle had been killed wounded or captured the demoralized survivors retreated back behind the walls of sevastopol and the allied forces dug in for a long siege the bitter cold of the ensuing winter coupled with severe supply shortages among the procedures soon led to a halt in ground operations a massive storm in late november destroyed 30 allied transport ships many carrying crucial winter clothing and other supplies which led to thousands of deaths of hypothermia and disease the russians made one more attempt to break out of the siege in february of 1855 attacking an ottoman base at the town of eupatoria north of sevastopol heavy artillery from the ottomans well-fortified positions forced the russians back and the attack was called off after just three hours of fighting the assault on eupatoria was the last major russian effort to break the siege but the miserable struggle for sevastopol was far from over in march british contractors completed the construction of the grand crimean central railway a rail line built to quickly bring ammunition and supplies from the ships to the siege lines the railway allowed the allies to intensify their bombardments of the city but it did little to stave off the waves of disease running rampant through their camps killing tens of thousands the flagging morale of the allied forces was bolstered somewhat by the arrival of 18 000 fresh troops from the kingdom of sardinia whose king hoped to strengthen his alliance with france the sardinian troops provided welcome support but even so when sevastopol finally fell on september 9th both sides were utterly exhausted and no further operations were conducted in crimea before the next winter arrived further east the russians and ottomans continued battering against each other in the caucasus where small and inconclusive engagements had been fought throughout the war while a handful of towns and forts in the region changed hands neither side was able to make any decisive gains on that front this trend was reflected across many other fronts with inconclusive skirmishes taking place in the azov sea the baltic and even russia's pacific coast by late 1855 after years of bloody and pointless fighting both sides were thoroughly sick of the war [Applause] the british public especially fed up with reports of fiascos like the charge of the light brigade and the staggering death toll from disease during the siege of sevastopol began to demand an immediate end to the conflict new technologies like the telegram and photography were making the truth about the horrors of war more accessible to the average citizen than ever before contributing to an unprecedented public outcry although the new british prime minister lord palmerston had great ambitions of expanding the war and permanently crippling the russian empire pressure from the public and his french allies eventually forced him to agree to peace talks on the russian side the new czar alexander ii felt pressured to make peace after austria prussia and sweden began showing signs that they might be willing to join the war on the allies side thus on march 30th 1856 the treaty of paris was signed and brought the crimean war to an end the treaty essentially amounted to a status quo restoring orthodox control of the churches in palestine forcing russia and the ottomans to return to each other's captured territories and banning any nation for maintaining warships or fortified ports in the black sea this clause of the treaty was later ignored by the russians in 1871 after the fall of napoleon iii in france caused the french to lose interest in eastern geopolitics six years later in 1877 the russian empire attacked the ottomans again this time claiming territory in the caucasus and securing the independence of bulgaria and other balkan states without much outside interference as russia simply went back and took what it had been after in the first place many in europe were left wondering what the point of the crimean war had been [Music] ultimately the only tangible outcome of the crimean war was a tremendous loss of life on both sides around 165 000 of all allied troops died and almost 120 000 of those died of disease the russians lost 130 000 89 000 of which were to disease in britain the public was outraged by the strategic and logistical failures at all levels of command during the war and widespread calls began for sweeping reforms of the army and greater professionalism in the medical field in particular the demands for army reforms were ultimately blocked but the push for medical reform spurred on by the famous battlefield nurses florence nightingale and mary c cole were much more successful leading to the development of professional nursing in britain and improving health care for all british society in russia the embarrassment of defeat prompted a major push for modernization across all sectors of society in order to catch up with the rest of europe the wave of reforms in the years following the crimean war included the abolishment of serfdom expansion of rail and telegraph networks modernization of medicine and the reorganization and modernization of the army the crimean war exposed some of the most devastating flaws of the established ways of waging war in europe prompting major efforts to modernize on both sides this push towards technological dominance contributed to the rise of nationalism in russia an ideology which would profoundly impact the nation's foreign policy for the rest of the 19th century further russian interference in the balkans would later give rise to nationalist sentiments in that volatile region escalating tensions that would eventually boil over into the assassination of an austrian prince in 1914 in many ways the crimean war was the first small domino in the chain leading up to the world wars [Music] thanks again to squarespace for sponsoring this video and powering the future of armchair

influence of the ottoman empire [Music] although once considered the menace of all christian europe by the 19th century the ottomans were in a rapid decline a decline which russia was eager to exploit but after the tumultuous shake-up of the napoleonic wars most other great powers of europe desperately wanted to avoid any more disruptions to the balance of power creating tension between them and the expansionist russians this tension finally boiled over in 1853 sparked by of all things a dispute over the rights of christians in the ottoman empire in an effort to project power in the middle east france declared itself the protector of all christians in the holy land and convinced the ottoman sultan abdul majjid the first to issue a decree that the catholic church had sole authority over all churches holy sites and christian citizens in palestine this irritated the eastern orthodox church in russia which had previously held control over most of these churches of course neither france nor russia really cared about the religious rights of christians in palestine controlling churches meant projecting power and influence in the middle east a strategic goal of both nations the french emperor had challenged russia to a game of chicken and the ottoman empire was unlucky enough to find itself right in the middle of it not one to back down the russian tsar nicholas the first promptly sent an ambassador to the ottomans in hope of changing the sultan's mind this effort succeeded and the sultan promptly restored authority over the churches to the orthodox church in russia expectedly the highly ambitious french emperor napoleon iii escalated the situation by sending a warship into the black sea as a show of force which prompted abdul majid to flip flop once again and proclaim his eternal respect for the authority of the catholic church further negotiations proved fruitless with the british ambassador to the ottoman empire stepping in to support the sultan against russian retaliation neither side was willing to pack down and so in may of 1853 two russian armies crossed the proof river and invaded the balkan provinces of the ottoman empire left with no other choice the ottomans declared war in response and sent forces to check the russian advance at the danube river arriving in september the ottoman empire quickly moved to establish strongholds along the danube under the leadership of the skilled general omar pacha the first battle of the war took place in early november when the ottomans crossed the river and recaptured the occupied town of altonitza in modern day romania the russians launched a counter-attack to reclaim the town resulting in a bloody and indecisive battle which ended with both sides withdrawing to their previous positions fighting in the balkans would continue in much the same way for the rest of 1853 with neither side managing to gain a decisive advantage tsar nicholas was hoping for an announcement of support from austria his long-term ally in order to break this stalemate but the austrians were reluctant to get involved instead they hoped to settle things with the mighty pen and hosted a conference in vienna with representatives from france britain and prussia with the goal of drafting a treaty to end the war while these talks were ongoing russian warships chanced upon an ottoman fleet near the port of cena hoping to disrupt their enemy's supply lines the russian ships opened fire initiating battle this engagement saw the first ever use of explosive shells in naval combat which completely devastated the wooden holes of the ottoman ships inflicting over three thousand casualties and destroying their entire fleet the events at cenop alarmed the other great powers and the representatives at vienna quickly finalized a proposed peace treaty which they presented to sultan abdul majit and tsar nicholas in december nicholas was willing to accept the terms offered but the sultan objected and diplomatic talks soon completely broke down fighting continued and in february of 1854 britain and france presented an ultimatum to russia withdraw from the balkans or they would join the war but now russia refused to back down and the british and french declared their own war in march of 1854 having made no further gains and fearing the intervention of a dubiously neutral austria nicholas ordered his forces to withdraw from the balkan provinces in july russia at this time was one of austria's most important allies and so by not supporting the russians they found themselves isolated diplomatically all throughout the 19th century [Music] with hostilities temporarily ceased the war could have ended there but britain and france spurred on by pro-war public opinion and eager to put an end to further russian expansion chose to continue the fighting launching a full invasion of the crimean peninsula seizing this peninsula would russia's naval power in the black sea greatly reducing their influence in the middle east and balkans the allied forces landed at a beach north of the city of sevastopol in september and their troubles began almost immediately the landing of the invasion force was badly mismanaged for starters there was no equipment for the unloading of cargo forcing the soldiers to steal carts and wagons from nearby tartar farms during this piecemeal unloading process the soldiers were forced to sleep outside in the rain and heat due to the lack of tents and camping supplies to make matters even worse there was not enough food or water to go around nor enough medicine to treat the many men who came down with cholera and other diseases after four days the invasion force finally overcame this comedy of errors and set out for sevastopol on the first day of their march the allied forces got their first glimpse of the russian army assembled on a hill on the other side of the alma river the next morning they crossed the river and attacked the russians beginning the battle of alma the defenders were outnumbered with 37 500 men standing against the 56 500 strong invasion force but the russians held a strong defensive position on a steep hill they held out against three hours of repeated assaults by the ottomans british and french before withdrawing however the allied forces were unable to pursue them due to their lack of cavalry following the battle the invading army marched southeast to the coast encircling sevastopol and establishing temporary ports at the towns of balaclava and camish to bring in supplies in october they began to besiege the city with cannon brought in by sea although further widespread outbreaks of cholera weakened the british army emboldening the defenders to launch several probing attacks on october 25th the russians attempted a large-scale assault on the british position at balaclava sending 25 000 men to disrupt the allies supply chain between their ports and these siege lines the first line of defenses at the verontsov heights manned by the ottomans was quickly overwhelmed and the russian cavalry then swept down the hill toward the second defensive line in the valley to the south there a combined force of ottoman and british infantry managed to hold the line against the enemy cavalry charge in a defense that would come to be known as the thin red line on the northern side of the hill the british cavalry's light brigade was sent to intercept russian forces attempting to withdraw after seizing ottoman artillery guns captured on the heights but this order relayed verbally through multiple sources in something like a game of telephone was ultimately misinterpreted by the light brigades commanders who sent the light cavalry charging down the valley straight into the teeth of a dug in russian artillery regiment the resulting charge of the light brigade was a complete failure and left over a third of the brigade soldiers killed wounded or captured and over a half of its horses dead shortly thereafter the russian forces pulled back to their newly captured defensive positions at the varanza of heights and the battle came to an end while the siege of sevastopol would continue the russians had won a tactical and morale boosting victory at balaklava in large part thanks to the disorganization of their enemies this disorganization and incompetence at the command level would continue to plague the allied forces for the rest of the war preventing them from gaining significant ground to watch the rest of this bloody stalemate play out head over to the

heavy weaponry the kokoda tracks terrain prevented either side from bringing artillery or air support to bear save for a few sporadic engagements with that let's join the action in papua new guinea 1942. an australian patrol makes its way through the thick foliage of the papuan jungle the diggers keep low and silent sticking to the shadows and keeping an ear open for any signs of movement a rustle in the underbrush the section commander signals a halt all is quiet for a moment until one rifleman sees another rustling bush he looks closer that's no bush that's a gilly sue he fires and the corpse of a japanese soldier falls out of the underbrush bullets fly as the ambush begins japanese infantry appearing from behind trees or in thick tangles or foliage uniforms studded with branches and leaves a punishing fuselaid comes from a nearby type 99 situated on a ledge overlooking the trail but it is quickly answered by some aussie riflemen the australian section commander cuts down the first enemy he sees with a burst from his thompson submachine gun wheeling around to see an enemy nco rushing in with his katana drawn he raises his weapon frantically pulling the trigger and gets a click in response the japanese commander draws closer until a burst of automatic gunfire rakes across his chest sending him careening into the shadowy underbrush the assistant section commander appears owen gunn smoking in his hands g'day boys now this little owen gun is a dead set feared income rip snorter bugger me tap you'll be ready for any surprise shin digs the nips decide to throw at you she's a true blue aussie original this tough little sub machine gun can be dragged through the mud filter the brim with sand take a soak in the ocean and still be ready to beat tojo and his goons back to the island the ambush has devolved into a close quarters battle of bayonets and submachine guns as both squads lmgs trade hails of fire the australians hold their own persevering through casualty after casualty until their section commander finally falls to a japanese bayonet the assistant calls for a retreat and the diggers withdraw in contact their brand gunner laying down a thick field of fire from the shoulder as the australians pull back the japanese give chase but they are held at bay by the aussie's brand they have little choice but to keep their distance as their foes disappear into the shadowy foliage ducking from a final hail from the type 99 although both sides of the kokoda campaign were highly skilled in jungle fighting the japanese were infamous for their use of ambushes which helps them take the field in this first encounter the australians lost a major advantage when their section commander's gun jammed eliminating a full third of their automatic firepower the japanese being armed primarily with bolt-action rifles would have little to counter this close range superiority the thompson submachine gun was notoriously unreliable in the papuan jungle requiring constant cleaning to stay functional let's see if a little more development helps the australians make up for lost ground as the sky above papua new guinea dances with the colors of sunset two squads of weary soldiers come upon a small village long abandoned by fearful locals this unclaimed station town of huts on stilts is a welcome sight for the australian and japanese grunts who just want a place to rest the australians are the first in methodically sweeping house to house the section commander orders his brand gunner to set up in a building with a good view of the rest of the village and the machine gun is quickly installed in a window with a commanding field of fire on the edge of town among the forest lie the japanese the squad leader observes the australians spreading out through the village and he orders his men to disperse among the trees they will meet their foes in the classic imperial fashion envelopment [Music] [Applause] [Music] the village is almost clear when the first shots ring out the australians scramble for cover as the japanese center comes in drawing as much attention as they can suddenly another group breaks in from the right and is quickly met by the burst of a bren gun but all of this is an elaborate ruse a fact made painfully evident when the japanese squad leader personally leads the bulk of his forces against the australian left the japanese quickly descend onto the village and a brutal crossfire develops as their type 99 gunner and another rifleman burst into a hut annihilating the aussie riflemen inside and setting up an lmg position of their own the diggers are not going to let this stand they split their forces and move through the village clearing each building with tried and true urban warfare tactics soon the australians have the initiative and the japanese commander withdraws to his lmg position to make a final stand there will be no surrender here the australians engage from whatever cover they can find rocks and these stilts supporting the houses until the last japanese soldier falls as the gunfire fades away into the gathering darkness the village goes quiet with this battle the australians even up the score the japanese tendency toward frontal attacks and shock tactics yielded success in their initial forays during the war but quickly became a predictable pattern and easy to counter when the japanese lacked the weight of numbers necessary to make the full use of their vigorous charges here the australian's flexibility allowed them to regain the initiative as they quickly moved from a surprised and ad hoc defense to using close quarters tactics to secure the village the japanese commander lost a considerable number of men in his faint and though they fought hard and took their foes by surprise this time the australians were victorious now let's see who takes the tie-breaking engagement in the streets of port moresby gunfire echoes through the streets of port moresby this is the last stand for the australians and the final hurdle for the japanese a victory here means not only the capture of papua new guinea but the possibility of an amphibious invasion of australia this is firmly on the mind of the australian infantry squad advancing down the street creeping from building to building eyes always on the windows and ledges above they wait for that fateful moment of enemy contact it comes in the form of a corpse now we're not about to engage in a stand-up fight boys the japanese are a crafty and ruthless opponent it'll do anything to win spike pits on your patrol route setting up a hand grenade in every doorway of a village even putting explosives on their own dead only the australian rifleman inches toward the corpse he cautiously extends his rifle and gives the body a gentle prod nothing he wedges his barrel under the body gently turning it over the riflemen and the body disappear in a ball of fire and shrapnel as a japanese squad appears in the street the hail of machine gun fire cutting off the australians escape the australians dive into these surrounding apartment blocks keeping their heads down to avoid a fuselaid of lmg fire however the section commander has had enough and orders three of his men to push forward and clear out the nest the japanese commander leads his men through byways and alleyways attempting to envelop his foes but the three diggers headed toward the machine gun run into a pair of japanese riflemen the japanese and australians meet in room to room firefights the japanese commander's new type 100 submachine gun allowing him to mow down the unsuspecting diggers with ease the sounds of hand-to-hand combat caused the section leader to order in advance and the aussie brand gunner repositions to fire a punishing burst from the shoulder silencing the japanese lmg long enough for his comrades to reposition both sides take heavy casualties in bayonet duels and point-blank shootouts sensing he may be losing the initiative the japanese commander rallies his surviving riflemen for a bonsai charge and they are cut down by the lone brent gunner two surviving diggers pelt the japanese machine gun nest with mills bombs and the streets go silent port moresby isn't safe yet but this street is firmly in the hands of australia both the australians and japanese had extensive experience in urban warfare but the japanese propensity for booby traps saw them take the early initiative in this battle the japanese continued their effort with their favored envelopment tactics and were able to split the australians into pockets scattered up and down the street however the japanese lack of submachine guns saw them at a significant disadvantage in close quarters combat and their light machine gun static implementation saw it easily flanked by the desperate australians with these streets clear the australians were able to fight their way back together and force the japanese into a final confrontation that saw them wiped out the australians take this match up two to one reflecting our belief that their widespread use of submachine guns higher rate of survivability and tactical flexibility make the diggers the superior infantry force the japanese receive high marks for creativity and ferocity however these fights were in no way for gone conclusions it is a hard-won victory for the australians but a victory nonetheless we hope you enjoyed this second episode of our infantry comparison series was your guest correct leave us a comment with your suggestions for who we

       " \" it is september 19th 1944 and the setting sun highlights what's left of the town of arnhem lieutenant colonel john frost takes cover as the sound of a strafing messerschmitt cuts through the constant reign of screaming artillery shells he and his men have defended the town for three days now and there still hasn't been any sign of relief from allied forces by this point they are beginning to run out of defensible positions and supplies but the sound of petrol engines snaps frost's eyes to the bridge's southern end desperately scanning through the turmoil as the clamor grows louder he looks in vain for any sign of british tanks when he sees none his heart sinks realizing the sounds are coming from the opposite end of the bridge a group of british airborne soldiers holler as german tanks round a corner guns thundering no one is coming to save frost and his men for the rest of the night they will fight for survival alone [Music] hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian in today's video we'll be covering the battle of arnhem one of the most heroic defensive actions fought by the allies during the second world war trapped inside the town for almost four days the men of the british first airborne division 2nd battalion endured countless assaults from an overwhelming superior enemy force even after it was clear that their situation was hopeless the brave

circumvent access defenses in the netherlands by way of a massive airborne operation such operations were often planned but rarely executed due to their immense logistical complexity and high risk of casualties but when faced with the heavily defended siegfried line allied planners under field marshal bernard montgomery finally decided to greenlight their next parachute assault operation numerous british american and polish airborne divisions totaling 35 000 men would be deployed to seize a line of bridges along highway 69 in order to open a route into germany and the rest of the netherlands these divisions were required to hold their positions for a maximum of three days while the british 30th corps swept north to reinforce them unfortunately for the battalions of the first british airborne division planning for their targets north of the urine river was flawed from the start a desire to preserve allied air power resulted in selecting too few aircraft to carry the entire fighting force in one day only half of the first division would be landing on the first day of the operation with the rest of the airdrops staggered over the following days to make matters worse german forces in the area had successfully made allied command overestimate how much anti-air artillery was north of the rhine this caused the allies to select landing zones much further away from their actual targets each battalion had to walk up to 8 miles or 13 kilometers before even reaching their targets and mounting attacks even worse men had to be left behind to defend the landing zones for the next day's drops despite these limitations the 1st 2nd and 3rd battalions landed successfully on the morning of september 17th german artillery and redeployments immediately engaged the 1st and 3rd battalions causing them to halt their advances toward the town while neither would manage to reach arnhem itself they did manage to kill general kusan the commandant of arnhem before being forced to fall back as for the second battalion they were the only british force to proceed to arnhem the only delay they suffered was the gratitude of the dutch civilians they passed many of whom cheered on the british troops upon reaching the railroad bridge south of osterbic later that day their good spirits were dashed by the site of german engineers demolishing the crossing eliminating any hope of assaulting their main objective arnhem bridge from the south as planned the second battalion's commander lieutenant colonel john frost quickly adapted in order to continue the operation an experienced paratrooper known for his boldness frost and the 2nd battalion made it to the northern side of arnhem by evening watching as the germans there redeployed over the bridge to respond to the other landings the second battalion avoided confrontation by sneaking through buildings and avoiding snipers taking the area surrounding the bridge's northern end with little resistance fighting truly began as the paratroopers assaulted the fortified german guards manning the bridge itself as part of their assault british flamethrowers struck an ammo and fuel depot lighting much of the bridge on fire in a massive inferno satisfied with having at least secured a foothold frost ordered the 2nd battalion to dig in after encountering a few more german patrols frost described his surroundings as the fighting finally stopped for the night the fires on the bridge lit up the whole area like daylight and the heat from them made the bridge impassable for that night at any rate anyone attempting to move to the other side now would be silhouetted against the flames in a way that would turn such a gamble into suicide alone and no longer wielding the element of surprise the 2nd battalion faced a much larger german force as the morning of the 18th broke now organized and aware of what they were up against the germans resumed their assault when the 9th ss reconnaissance battalion tried to push across the bridge from the south in their attempt a number of armored cars punched through the british position before their six-pound anti-tank guns could disable the rest this bought time for the 9th ss panzer division to surround arnhem assaulting the north end of the bridge and taking up positions in overlooking homes and buildings as the 2nd battalion struggled to hold out german mortars and artillery assisted the assault with constant shelling frost describes how close the defenders came to collapsing each hit seemed to pulverize the masonry and the appalling crash of these missiles against our walls scared the daylights out of headquarters although they endured the onslaught the second battalion ended the day in much worse shape than it had begun with plenty of wounded and dwindling medical supplies the beleaguered paratroopers continued to hold out for reinforcements that were still miles away the allied battalions outside of arnhem continued attempting to press their way into the town as more airborne troops began to drop most that did so faced german opposition immediately and were forced to join the 11th first and third battalions in osterbig for their own defense german forces quickly besieged the town trapping them inside and ensuring no relief reached arnhem on the third day of fighting the germans decided to switch tactics the arrival of german self-propelled artillery meant that most of the day was characterized by shelling and bombing rather than continuing to rush a fortified british battalion by the afternoon the luftwaffe had begun strafing runs on houses occupied by frost's forces and the ninth panzer regiment had arrived at the northern end of town understanding the second battalion's dire situation better than he did german commanders pressed the attack with a systematic approach throughout the night stug three assault guns dismantled the british position house by house with the assistance of artillery strikes and air support and by the dawn of the 20th much of arnhem was in ruin the british were nearly out of everything from food and medical supplies to ammunition attempts to resupply the paratroopers had fallen into german hands and communication was re-established only long enough to learn that all further allied attempts to reach arnhem were being abandoned as if to accent the day a mortar shell landed beside frost and injured both of his legs removing him from command fires raised what few structures the british had left to take cover in including those being used as makeshift hospitals for the wounded a two-hour truce was brokered to evacuate the wounded british troops into german custody including frost himself he recalled his displeasure in stark detail stating we still could not believe that the 30th corps would fail to come to our rescue it was difficult to feel that there was enough genuine opposition to stop them it was desperately disappointing and having done everything we had been asked to do we were now prisoners the battle soon devolved into skirmishes as the british were dislodged from the bridge and took to hiding and what structures remained their last radio broadcast heard by no one except the germans encapsulated the spirit of the day out of ammunition god saved the king by the 21st the battle of arnhem concluded as the german forces there cleared the bridge enabling them to finally respond southward toward nijmegen fighting continued at osterbik thanks in great part to the arrival of the first polish parachute brigade who had managed to receive one of the few warnings from the second battalion about german positions and so changed landing zones between the relief they provided and the role they would play in protecting their allies during the upcoming evacuations south over the rhine the polish paratroopers would carry on the second battalion's bravery in the coming days overall the battle of arnhem was a failure for the british blame for the devastation was assigned almost immediately to the first polish parachute brigade whom the british described as having fought very badly at arnhem despite never once setting foot in the town cooperating with the wise advice of their very supportive british allies the exiled polish government saw to it that the first brigade's commander was removed immediately despite its overall failure operation market garden did succeed in capturing and holding strategic locations south of the rhine this allowed the allies to liberate much of the southern netherlands before winter set in and gave them a strong footing to launch renewed defensives the following spring the rest of the country would be liberated as late as may of 1945. [Applause] lieutenant colonel frost would endure german custody for seven months in the years following the war he became a legend among the british army much like the rest of the second battalion dropped hundreds of feet with little support well behind enemy lines they had fought to the last man longer than expected exemplifying the experiences of the paratroopers throughout the war the missions that these soldiers undertook successes and failures alike were unlike any the world has ever seen thanks again to our sponsor squarespace for making this video possible don't forget to click the link in the description below [Music] [Music] you\",\n",

about whether or not the usa was justified in its intervention what mistakes it made and if america really ever had a chance of victory but while topics such as these are very common what is much less

link in the description below choose your country and start fighting your way to victory now to understand the attitude of the vietnamese during the war one must first be aware of vietnam's history of occupation and exploitation by foreign powers first there was china which spent a thousand years trying to absorb the nation through both conquest and cultural assimilation however by the 19th century china was undergoing its own negative experiences with colonialism as powerful european empires began expanding into asia and destroying the old status quo with chinese influence on the wane it seemed as if vietnam might have a chance to stand on its own but a small squadron of french warships would promptly crush those hopes unable to resist this technologically superior foe the win imperial dynasty ruling vietnam at the time quickly capitulated and by 1884 most of vietnam had become part of the greater colonial union of french indochina with the win court reduced to a puppet administration colonial governors operated with virtually no oversight from the french state and were allowed to use any and all means at their disposal to suppress any hint of native resistance often this extended to the point of criminalizing the mere act of identifying oneself as vietnamese trapped in a thoroughly miserable existence the vietnamese peasants were desperate for a savior any savior but after decades of failed revolts and horrific reprisals the iron grip of colonialism remained as strong as ever yet unbeknownst to the peasantry the seeds of a new revolution were already being sown not in the plantations or even in the courts of the wind bureaucracy but in the coffee houses of paris where the few vietnamese lucky enough to scrape together enough money to afford a western education were debating the merits of a strange radical new ideology known as communism unlike any political ideology at the time communism promised freedom and equality for those laboring under the yoke of capitalistic imperialism and so spread like wildfire from the moment it was introduced from overseas becoming vietnam's dominant underground political movement by the early 1930s [Music] central to the communist movement in vietnam was the unassuming son of a disgraced bureaucrat called win sing or as he is more commonly known ho chi minh after leaving vietnam sometime in the 1910s ho chi minh drifted around europe visiting both the united states and possibly britain as early as 1918 he was a dedicated anti-imperialist joining the group of vietnamese patriots which petitioned the french government for independence during the treaty of versailles in 1920 he was one of the many communists avidly following the progress of vladimir lenin's october revolution in russia the success of which proved beyond any doubt that the imperialist system could be overthrown through force of arms [Music] inspired by lenin's success ho chi minh chaired the first meeting of what would become the indo-chinese communist party or icp in 1930 with the express goal of ending colonial rule of his native country but for all of his early efforts regime change in vietnam would not originate with the vietnamese but would instead be instigated from the most unlikely of sources imperial japan in 1940 japan invaded vietnam as part of their efforts to establish the greater east asia co-prosperity sphere or in other words a series of client states under imperial domination in 1945 they officially annexed the country and expelled all western influences including the entire french colonial administration mere months later the japanese surrendered to the allies and with their collapse vietnam's century-old political order had come crashing down leaving total chaos in its wake it was during this last chaotic year of the occupation that ho chi minh truly came into his own as leader he had returned to vietnam in 1941 to organize a major resistance movement against japanese forces known as the viet minh and by 1945 he was leading an army of at least 10 000 communist gorillas his long-awaited revolution began on august 15th before even the ink on the japanese instrument of surrender had time to dry with the french colonial forces in vietnam having been disarmed by the japanese earlier that year there was a brief window in time where the vietmen had free run of the entire country but far from screaming defiance at the hated western imperialists ho chi minh was instead positively desperate to secure a friendship with the united states this was due in large part to the activities of the u.s office of strategic services or oss which had made contact with the viet minh in 1945 and selected ho chi minh as their primary contact within vietnam part of what enabled the close relationship between america and the viet minh was their lack of a traditional communist agenda despite ho chi minh's unabashed belief in the ideology his primary goal was always the liberation of vietnam as he himself stated at first patriotism not yet communism as a result both joseph stalin and mao zedong initially distrusted ho chi minh for his unwillingness to make class warfare a priority above national freedom this however struck a chord with american observers who were naturally sympathetic to the idea of an oppressed nation throwing off the shackles of a domineering imperialist regime [Music] thus oss operatives celebrated alongside the peasantry when ho chi minh declared the democratic republic of vietnam on september 2nd 1945. in his opening speech he began with words familiar to every american behind him on the podium stood oss major archimedes patty and as the speech came to a close a plane bearing u.s markings flew over the assembled crowd which greeted its appearance with thunderous applause all across the nation americans were seen as heroes and liberators and for a moment it seemed as if this would be the start of a glorious new relationship between east and west of course we all know that this was never really an option the french wanted their colonies back and the newly elected president truman had no interest in cooperating with an openly communist regime after negotiations with the french broke down completely the vietnamese had no choice but to fight for their independence and the first indochina war began on december 16th 1946 during this time the wind dynasty attempted to reassert its control over the nation with the 13th emperor bao dai siding with the french and resuming his place as a puppet ruler over their occupied territories as the war dragged on the u.s began sending aid to the french but after their dramatic defeat at diane bien phu in 1954 they agreed to new negotiations with the vietnam the ensuing treaty split the country in two halves the drv in the north and the state of vietnam in the south baodai was then unceremoniously ousted by his prime minister no din diem after a referendum determined that the state of vietnam should become a republic however this was hardly a triumph of democracy over imperialism for diem was utterly corrupt and the referendum was blatantly rigged diem even went so far as to deliberately ignore the french promise that the south would be allowed to vote on whether or not to reunite with the north under the drv when it became obvious that the dm had no intention of allowing reunification drv-backed insurgents began popping up all over the south causing him to become even more anti-communist and in turn causing america to offer increasing amounts of aid to his administration however diem proved to be a fickle ally often refusing to cooperate with his u.s backers especially in regards to rural development and land management in 1963 tensions finally came to a head when diem was abruptly assassinated in a military coup d'etat that was aided by the cia this combined with the gulf of tonkin incident in 1964 paved the way for a full-scale u.s invasion from the outset of war vietnamese generals knew that a conventional victory was impossible america was simply too powerful to defeat using traditional battlefield tactics but the huge rural population of the south was already mostly under the sway of the drv-backed national liberation front or more commonly known as the vietcong or vc the vc in combination with the people's army of vietnam waged a successful series of campaigns against the disorganized south vietnamese until large numbers of american troops began arriving in 1965 following american involvement the conflict began to shift into a war of attrition [Music] vietnamese defense strategy revolved around their extensive network of tunnels which many likened more to underground cities than mere military strongholds over 200 miles or 321 kilometers of tunnel were dug during the war with the largest system at kuche being just 20 miles or 32 kilometers outside saigon their importance was summed up in the words of colonel chaolam we knew the americans were determined to find and destroy the tunnel system they understood as did we however kuche went so did the war it was our determination not to lose even one centimeter of the tunnels it was a contest of wills resulting in some very fierce fighting we made a tremendous sacrifice to gain victory two years after its arrival the united states of america expanded its bombing campaigns across north vietnam in an effort to break their will to fight when a north vietnamese civilian saw the first b-57 bombers open their bombays over his home province of quang min his first thought was not to flee and panic but was instead why is a mother airplane dropping baby airplanes having miraculously survived the initial attack he gathered his family and fled for the nearby caves he later recalled to a journalist people didn't talk about the meaning of the war we were really confused why the americans tried to invade our homeland we hadn't done anything to them [Music] sadly the citizens of vietnam had much more to fear than american bombs when vietcong gorillas went to ground among the rural peasantry u.s forces responded by declaring any villages with a suspected vc presence as free fire zones then came the infamous melee massacre on march 16 1968 when at least 347 unarmed civilians were brutally executed by american soldiers although the heroic actions of a u.s helicopter crew saved a few innocent lives most were not so fortunate and mili would go on to become known as the worst war crime ever perpetrated by u.s soldiers in vietnam as traumatizing as the war was for the civilian population it was arguably just as bad for the vietnamese soldiers on account of how long most were expected to serve on the front lines [Music] lake haudai head of surgery at a military hospital later recalled when we were called to go south everyone was very excited as it turned out while i only planned to stay for six months i ended up staying for eight years given these extended deployment times vietnamese soldiers quickly became hardened to the horrors of war and had little mercy for any americans unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp american pilots were especially loathed due to their indiscriminate bombing campaigns and many were tortured to death after they bailed out over vietnamese territory to keep their populace motivated and stave off the effects of war weariness the drv maintained strong and effective propaganda campaigns throughout the conflict the mastermind behind these campaigns was vo winzop a renowned military leader who had fought alongside ho chi minh since the 1940s people quickly formed long queues to purchase his newspapers and listen to loudspeaker broadcasts about the latest developments on the front lines with minimal access to international news the people of the north were easily swayed by party rhetoric and quickly came to regard the war as a necessary and righteous struggle against yet another imperialist aggressor by contrast the urban population of the south could listen to four news reports and had a much more conflicted attitude towards the violence tearing apart their nation the success of the vietnamese propaganda machine was demonstrated following the tet offensive of 1968 which caught u.s forces completely by surprise amidst the chaos vc infiltrators launched an attack on the american embassy in saigon penetrating the compound and opening fire on the chancery building with rocket-propelled grenades although the building withstood the assault the fact that such an attack had occurred at all was psychologically devastating to the usa proving that not even the capital city of south vietnam was safe from communist infiltration the tet offensive also brought the reality of war to the urban population of the south leading many to lose confidence in the western-backed government by the early 1970s the endless jungle warfare had taken their toll on both sides but the drv remained defiant while u.s morale had plummeted to the point where soldiers were openly ignoring orders and deserting in record numbers desperate to at least preserve the status quo america began pouring resources into strengthening the south vietnamese army while pulling out its own traumatized troops out of the conflict but it was too little too late and in 1975 a massive offensive by the drv known as the ho chi minh campaign smashed through the defenses around saigon and decapitated the republic after almost 20 years of war and millions of deaths the drv finally stood triumphant against all odds communism had won or had it while the sacrifices made by the north vietnamese during the war allowed them to survive and eventually reunite with the south the conflict would leave millions on both sides scarred for life furthermore despite the expectations of the international community communism failed to spread throughout southeast asia after the fall of saigon rendering decades of u.s obsession with the domino theory utterly pointless despite the repeated entries of ho chi minh and extensive testimonies by oss operatives in the 1940s america never fully grasped that it was the desire for liberty not communism that motivated the north vietnamese to fight on against the odds their support of the corrupt diem administration only furthered this rift in understanding and the resultant two decades of violence opened up a deep national wound between north and south that has yet to be fully healed thanks again to our sponsor conflict of nations

       " \" it is the 9th of august 1937 and a nervous chinese soldier is standing guard at the gates of hangzhou airport in shanghai he has heard reports from the north of a great japanese army sweeping through beijing's feeble defenses crushing all resistance in their path yet inexplicably things here in the south remain almost disturbingly normal with no formal declaration of war the citizens of shanghai are not even sure what to think suddenly his quiet musings are interrupted by the screech of tires as a car breaks sharply at the checkpoint barrier as the soldier hurries towards it he sees the face of a japanese lieutenant through the windshield the soldier throws up his arms in warning japanese are expressly forbidden from entering the airport but the lieutenant ignores him putting his car into reverse and swinging the wheel to try and drive around the barrier once again the chinese soldier intercepts him furious the lieutenant responds by drawing his pistol and with a

the weight of internal and external threats however in the 1920s the kuomintang or chinese nationalist party led by shanghai sheck finally managed to wrestle control of the country from warlords that had ruled the fragmented remnants of the old qing dynasty but then everything changed when the japanese nation attacked still in the midst of their unsteady recovery the kuomintang could only watch as its new rival seized all of manchuria in 1932. forcing china to sign yet another unequal treaty recognizing the authority of a foreign power both sides knew that manchuria was just the beginning of japanese ambitions in asia and border skirmishes between the two powers would continue for the next five years during this interim period shang's new government grappled with the legacy of the century of humiliation which had enabled foreign powers to establish colonies in chinese territory shanghai was one such location and arguably it was the most important sitting at the mouth of the yangtze river the city served as a gateway to the interior of china and featured a bustling industrial sector port facilities and a large expatriate population as a result by the 1930s shanghai was mostly controlled by western nations and the japanese in 1937 tensions between the chinese and the japanese exploded after the marco polo bridge incident near the city of beijing which the japanese used as an excuse to launch what was essentially an invasion of northern china but despite this blatant act of aggression war was not officially declared and shanghai sheck tried to negotiate if only to delay the inevitable neither side expected a major confrontation at shanghai at least until a belligerent japanese lieutenant started a shootout with chinese soldiers at shanghai airport resulting in his death the japanese quickly jumped on this incident demanding that the chinese national revolutionary army or nra leave the city in response shang deployed more troops to shanghai to counter the japanese troops stationed there and on august 13th the battle began [Music] chang's decision to escalate the incident was strategic in three ways first opening up a second front would slow down the japanese advance in the north by drawing away manpower and resources second preemptively expelling the japanese from shanghai would prevent them from using it as a foothold if they conducted a second invasion in the south and third a major battle would demonstrate chinese resolve to the rest of the world however the decision was risky as a japanese breakthrough would threaten the capital city nanshing which was little more than 300 kilometers or 186 miles down river initially the chinese operational goal was simply to destroy japanese forces in the area although they possessed a huge numerical advantage the chinese army of the time was incapable of waging modern warfare with the exception of certain units such as the elite german-trained 88th division most chinese soldiers were poorly equipped conscripts marching into battle with nothing but a rifle and a bayonet this in conjunction with mass frontal assaults against a fortified enemy with tanks and artillery resulted in massive casualties and virtually no progress though they were unable to accomplish their objective the nra was able to contain the japanese who were forced to explore other options ultimately it was decided that an amphibious assault consisting of three divisions under general iwan matsui would be performed in the northern section of the city with the goal of outflanking the chinese forces concentrated in downtown shanghai beginning on the 23rd of august matsui's men landed with support of tanks naval artillery and aircraft but instead of the rapid breakthrough they were expecting the japanese had to fight village by village against the chinese who possessed overwhelming numerical superiority and had painstakingly built rudimentary fortifications for the next week the nra attempted to repel the japanese where they landed taking heavy casualties in the process on the 6th of september the imperial japanese army or iga captured the town of baoshan giving them a foothold in the northern suburbs rather than waste his manpower on hopeless counter-attacks shang redeployed his forces around the town of lodian nine kilometers or five and a half miles inland which was a major road junction that the japanese could use to sustain their logistics the lodian area was heavily contested and changed hands several times unlike previous engagements the chinese avoided masked frontal assaults instead resorting to knight attacks which prevented the japanese from utilizing their advantage in firepower the fighting around lo diane was exceptionally fierce and by the end of the battle it had been nicknamed the flesh mill it was only a matter of time before the position became untenable for the nra and they withdrew on the 15th of september the next major defensive position on the chinese line was the small town of da chang 12 kilometers or seven and a half miles to the south east of luardian shang's men were dug in and prepared for the japanese who arrived on the 1st of october what ensued was three weeks of brutal urban warfare in desperation the nra commanders resorted to the tactics which had cost them so heavily in the early stages of the battle such as frontal attacks and massed charges however like in august japanese firepower could not be overcome even with advantage in manpower and the nra was forced out of da chong on the 25th of october despite this development shang decided to redeploy his men in the city to the western suburbs he was determined to show the world that although downtown shanghai was lost the chinese had not given up and would fight the japanese every step of the way as such he ordered a battalion from the elite 88th division to defend sihang warehouse which bordered the western controlled international settlement while the rest of the nra retreated from downtown shanghai sheng hoped that the foreigners watching the battle from across the river would see the fierceness of chinese resistance additionally the warehouse was made of concrete and the danger of striking foreign territory forced japan not to use naval artillery on the 27th of october the japanese surrounded the warehouse and for the next three days they attempted to dislodge the 400 defenders through bombardment and repeated infantry and tank assaults but were unsuccessful finally on november 1st shang allowed the defenders to retreat and most escaped to the international settlement while xihong warehouse was being contested the japanese landed a second invasion force at jinshanwei 40 kilometers or 24 miles south of downtown shanghai threatened with encirclement shang finally ordered a general retreat from the city and its suburbs for the chinese the most important priority was now the defense of the capital nanshing only 300 kilometers or 180 miles up the yangtze on november the 11th the japanese began the march to nanjing and little more than a month later the capital fell the loss of shanghai had dire effects for the chinese war effort due to its economic importance and the fact that it had enabled the japanese to capture nanjing aggravating this were the huge losses that the nra suffered of the seven hundred thousand men deployed to shanghai roughly three hundred thousand became casualties the german-trained divisions which shang deployed at the most crucial points of defense were especially hard hit losing 60 percent of their strength however the battle was a morale victory for the chinese who felt that they had demonstrated their resolve to both the enemy and the international community additionally the battle bought them enough time to relocate most of their industry to the chinese interior the japanese although victorious were bitterly disappointed about how costly the battle had been they underestimated the chinese will to fight and expected shanghai to fall in a few days rather than three months it took not one but two naval invasions to take the city and out of the three hundred thousand japanese soldiers who were deployed there were sixty thousand killed or injured despite its loss at shanghai china continued to resist alone for the next four years thanks again to

       " \" with winter rapidly closing in the allies had little time to prepare for their assaults on kesselring's masterpiece an innovator in both military tactics and apparently chess the gambit we've named after the german general includes distracting your opponent and quickly switching out all of your pawns for castles on the 1st of december the first probing attacks began in the west made against a large bulge in the german defenses known as the baron heartline conditions were terrible with freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall making for an agonizing trek for the soldiers as they struggled their way through hostile terrain after several weeks of intermittent engagements the allies were only able to wrestle a number of small villages away from enemy control in the end it was the germans who decided to withdraw falling back to the more tenable gustav line in early january of 1944 while the fifth army was busy dying in the snow the eighth army also found itself preoccupied with well dying in the snow the eighth had attacked the gustav line on the 4th of december and made significant headway but then the germans made a strategic withdrawal through a deep gully which funneled the commonwealth forces into a carefully prepared killing ground any unit entering the guli was brutally mauled and allied progress was completely stalled until german forces withdrew to a new position on the 20th the next set of battles for the gustav line took place at the towns of ortona and orsonia the former approved an absolute nightmare for the canadian units assigned to capture it as they were forced to engage in some of the bloodiest street fighting on the western front the german parachute battalion defending the town had dug in deep and had to be fought from building to building in a protracted struggle that resulted in roughly 4 500 casualties altogether decimating both the first canadian division as well as the civilian population or sonia meanwhile resisted every attack holding out until a massive blizzard struck the adriatic coastline and forced the british to halt their offensive but even this could not end the bloodshed for long and on january 14th the two allied armies launched yet another series of attacks on the line starting the notorious battle for monty casino [Music] before we enter the fray let's take a moment to thank our sponsor for this video

failed due to either terrain or a lack of armored support and a fourth ended with minor gains that were promptly abandoned due to the lack of supplies after these repeated failures the allies authorized operation avenger which fixated on the monty casino abbey as the linchpin of german defenses in the area on february 15th a huge bomber raid reduced the abbey to a smoldering pile of rubble unfortunately the raid was badly coordinated and was not followed up by a ground assault so in the end little was accomplished while this was ongoing the allies had also conducted a naval landing near the city of ancio to outflank the gustav line but after landing relatively unopposed general john p lucas made the inexplicable decision to dig in and fortify his position rather than push inland kessel ring promptly wheeled his reserves about and smashed into the beachhead beginning a long battle of attrition that would last until may meanwhile the third battle for casino began on march 15th with a creeping barrage that disordered the german line but this ray of hope was quickly snuffed out by heavy rains giving the germans time to prepare however by now it was clear that the axis was losing the battle of attrition and the final breakthrough came on may 11th when both the 8th and 5th armies attacked at once aided by the french expeditionary corps and even some polish forces this last tremendous push finally fractured the gustav line which held for nearly six months but although the main line of axis defenses had been breached there was still much to be done and the push north continued a breakout was also staged at ancio with the help of an artillery bombardment and close air support in danger of becoming encircled kessel ring received orders to fall back but right at the pivotal moment general mark clark decided to ignore orders to pursue the german army and instead drove towards rome unable to believe his luck a delighted kessel rang quickly pulled back to yet another set of defensive works codenamed the gothic line after so much blood had been shed the actual capture of rome was something of an anti-climax with german attention turning towards the inevitable invasion of france the city had all but been abandoned after a few brief skirmishes rome was liberated on june 4th just two days prior to the landings in normandy getting there had required six hundred thousand allied troops over one hundred thousand of which had become casualties since the day they first landed in italy but despite their grievous losses there was little time to rest and recuperate kessel ring had proven a genius at defensive warfare and leaving him to his own devices would undoubtedly prove disastrous thus british and american armies raced up the coast only to be checked yet again at the improvised trossy mene line encountered on june 20th stalled for another week the germans had ample time to move the bulk of its army to the aponine mountains infuriated but impotent the allies could do nothing but resign themselves to yet another long riding siege on august 25th the allies launched operation olive aimed at breaching the gothic line and finally ending the seemingly eternal battle for italy the eighth army was to attack german positions along the adriatic coast and when castle ring had committed his reserves to that area mark clark's fifth army would strike at the weakened center breaking through to bologna initial progress was good but kesselring continued to pull his old tricks and refused to be lured into fighting on unequal terms by the end of september the allies had clambered their way over the peaks of the aponine mountains having suffered 14 000 casualties then autumn reigns stalled further attacks grounding air support and turning vital supply routes into impassable quagmires at this point the remainder of 1944 would be spent in a deadlock with a single axis counter-attack in december managing to briefly reoccupy a section of the gothic line although castle ring had done a spectacular job in italy his position was about to change drastically he was severely injured in a car crash in october and upon his recovery found himself replacing field marshal gert von roenstedt as commander of the entire western front on march 10th even he could do nothing but watch the final collapse of the third reich as allied troops were already pouring into germany itself in spring of 1945 the allies launched their final offensive in italy operation grapeshot during the months-long stalemate the fifth and eighth armies had been reinforced by a diverse collection of units from various nations including several thousand british trained italian volunteers and even a division from the brazilian expeditionary force the attack began on april 6th with a long artillery bombardment then attacks all along the line by commonwealth troops without any reserves left the germans could no longer do anything but desperately try to hold the line however the situation was hopeless by the 20th of april the two allied armies had broken into the po valley and only five days later mussolini was dragged out of hiding by italian partisans and summarily executed with no reason left to fight kessel ring's replacement opened up negotiations with the allies and signed a surrender order on may 2nd just a few days before the official end of the war in europe after so many gambits and clever plays the chessboard of italy had been cleared the final handshake between players would occur at last a year and a half after the start of their unexpected rematch in many ways the italian campaign showcased both the best and worst moments from the second world war the idea to divert forces from the eastern front was sound but internal division quickly turned the campaign into an unfocused mess supplies were diverted to other operations and arguments among allied generals led to missed opportunities and long delays kesselring also demonstrated exactly how deadly the vermost could be on the defense holding out for over a year against a much greater force which by that point possessed total air superiority but the battles in italy kept hundreds of thousands of german soldiers occupied at a time when manpower was critically low and the experience gained from the amphibious landings at salerno proved invaluable to the planners of d-day still historians remain divided on the campaign with many arguing that it was an outright strategic failure but others see it as part of a bigger picture a necessary even vital component to the fall of the axis powers into the liberation of europe thanks again to squarespace for sponsoring this video build your next website with squarespace and use our link below to

       " \" it is late january 1944 and just south of monty casino the men of the 36th infantry division are attempting to secure a bridgehead over the gauri river enemy fire is intense with german artillery saturating the area in a relentless deafening barrage despite enormous losses two regiments have made the crossing but now they are trapped their landing craft reduced to splinters by this ceaseless bombardment back on the opposite shore major general fred walker watches the disaster unfold through his binoculars a veteran of the great war he knows an impossible situation when he sees one glancing backwards at the one remaining regiment under his command he debates ordering them forward but after a moment he dismisses the idea even if a miracle happens and this river is taken the cycle will just repeat at the next one sighing to himself he wonders how anyone could have been foolish enough to envision italy as the soft underbelly of europe hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian in today's video we'll be continuing our look at the italian campaign in the second world war last time we covered the invasion of sicily which gave the allies a springboard to launch an attack on the mainland in the wake of defeat morale plummeted and the italian fascist party was in an uproar over mussolini's inability to deal with the situation on the 24th of july 1943 just 15 days after the landings in sicily the party undertook its first and only democratic vote to depose its leader disband the party and sue for peace this vote passed 19 to 8 and a loudly protesting mussolini was promptly carted off to prison aware that germany would never allow it to peacefully surrender the new italian government dramatically announced that it had every intention of fighting to the

checkers a single handshake would end the game before it reached the italian countryside but no such handshake would happen as 16 new german divisions crossed the alps into northern italy spoiling for a rematch but the allies were not deterred as far in the east joseph stalin remained insistent that the allies maintained pressure on the western front and divert as many axis forces as possible away from the soviet union thus the second match began on september 3rd when soldiers of the british 8th army dashed across the straits of messina this was intended as a diversion from the real landings scheduled to take place a week later but albert kesselring the general in charge of the german troops stationed in italy was no fool and simply ordered the men stationed in the area to retreat and consolidate their positions further north denied battle the frustrated british advanced at a snail's pace delayed by minefields roadblocks and collapsed bridges a few days later a second british operation took place this time aimed at taking the port of taranto and establishing a supply base for the eighth army again the initial landings went unopposed as british forces established control over the south of the country news of the italian surrender was made public and the situation promptly took a turn for the worse on hitler's orders german forces undertook operation aksa quickly disarming the remainder of the italian military while a few divisions chose to resist the majority either meekly surrendered or agreed to fight alongside their new occupiers the new italian government fled rome which was occupied on the 10th and mussolini found himself thrust back into the international spotlight at the head of a new puppet state the italian socialist republic with italy controlled by nazi germany there was no hope of a swift victory and the stage was set for the prolonged bloody conflict that would follow despite this setback many allied planners remained optimistic holding on to the dream of a lightning campaign to liberate the peninsula the minimal resistance encountered by the british led to the belief that the germans were still preoccupied dealing with the italian army and lack either the will or the manpower to defend territory south of rome so on the 9th of september the allies commenced operation avalanche with a total of nine divisions from the us fifth army launching from staging points on sicily and heading straight for a roughly 35 mile or 56 kilometer stretch of italian coastline near the port of salerno at this point in time the fifth army was a combined force of both british and american troops the former were to land in the north near salerno itself while the latter were directed further south from the start the landings were severely mismanaged with historians arguing to this day over who deserves the most blame for the ensuing fiasco despite strenuous protests from the leader of the naval task force admiral kent hewitt the american landing zones were not subjected to a preliminary bombardment this was due to the mistaken assumption that the operation had the element of surprise despite sightings of luftwaffe reconnaissance planes over the task force as it crossed from sicily predictably kessel ring had guessed the american plan of action and positioned his troops to contest the landings left with no alternative the men of the fifth army waded ashore under intense bombardment from machine guns field artillery and panzers the beaches quickly turned into a slaughterhouse and for a brief moment the fate of the entire campaign hung in the balance then the guns of the naval task force finally opened up blasting gaps in the temporary german fortifications and opening the way for the beleaguered troops to rush through and establish a beachhead [Music] but this was by no means an end to the carnage as the entire 16th panzer division then thundered down from the hills to continue the onslaught during the frantic fighting that ensued naval gunfire again proved decisive with the cruiser and destroyer escorts engaging a minimum of 130 shorebound targets during the first day alone further north the british divisions had faced somewhat lighter resistance and had only gone ashore after their escort ships had spent 15 minutes softening up the german defenses after pushing inland they were able to capture a vital airfield and a force of sas commandos and us army rangers entered salerno itself and drove out the defenders after a brief bout of street fighting but the situation was still dire and german counter-attacks were relentless the luftwaffe also conducted many sorties against both the beachheads and the naval task force sinking approximately 100 landing craft of various sizes and damaging various warships after another six days kesselring was forced to retreat on direct orders from high command hitler had conferred with erwin rommel and both men had agreed it was pointless to try and defend southern italy although they had very nearly succeeded in throwing the fifth army back into the sea german losses had been heavy especially among the precious panzer divisions but these losses were not crippling and the rough italian countryside presented many opportunities for the germans to make life hell for the allies as they pushed up the peninsula having been battered almost to the point of breaking the weary men of the fifth army were reluctant to drive north after their retreating enemies morale was extremely low and as a result the decision was made to delay the push on rome until october in the meantime allied forces concentrated on consolidating their hold on southern italy and capturing the airfields located on the companion plains while this was ongoing the civilian population of naples rose in an unexpected revolt creating enough chaos for the allies to force a german retreat from the area on october 3rd the sas conducted a daring amphibious assault on the city of tirmoli part of the first defensive line south of rome this was known as the voltorno line and ran parallel to two large rivers the raid was a remarkable success with the commando team seizing the city and holding it until being reinforced by the commonwealth thief army however the river crossings were delayed by the need to build bridges capable of withstanding the weight of allied tanks as the engineers got to work the 16th panzer division struck again further impeding construction efforts and inflicting significant casualties but the two allied armies pressed on reaching the second line of german defenses in late october known as the barbara line once again the rough terrain proved as big an obstacle as enemy fire and it was only on the 9th of november that a significant breakthrough was finally made by this point about three months had passed since combat operations started in italy and all hopes for a lightning campaign to liberate the peninsula had been dashed miles of barbed wire fortified machine gun pits camouflaged bunkers and extensive minefields now lay in wait for the two advancing armies all located in some of mainland europe's roughest terrain

amidst the ruins people still remain although battered and beaten the hearty german spirit still endures but unbeknownst to them they are about to become pawns in an even greater war one fought not with guns and bombs but with economics and ideology at the potsdam conference germany was divided between the allied powers with the stroke of a pen 16 million people fell under soviet dominion the

subjects harshly the defeated populists could only watch as russian soldiers rapidly dismantled what little remained of their industrial infrastructure and shipped it back to russia tens of thousands of suspected nazi sympathizers or anti-communists were rounded up and imprisoned at repurposed concentration camps simultaneously the soviets set to work laying the political foundations for a communist regime in east germany in 1946 the occupiers forcibly merged two german political parties the communist party and the social democratic party to form the socialist unity party of germany or sed the sed was quickly purged of all opponents of stalinism and was then installed as the sole ruling party in the new government in october of 1949 the soviets formally turned over political control over their occupied zone to the sed establishing the german air quotes democratic republic or gdr as a new air quotes independent nation from the moment of its creation east germany and its people were faced with tremendous hardship the western portion of germany namely the roar valley had always been the industrial heart of the nation and its loss left the gdr with almost no industrial capacity this resulted in devastating shortages of most essential goods and the population suffered from severe malnourishment with nothing available to purchase laborers had no incentive to work which caused the economy to stagnate even further as the beleaguered citizens of east germany struggled to survive their former countrymen in the west were already experiencing economic recovery thanks to the american aid under what was called the marshall plan when news of this supposed prosperity reached the gdr desperate people began to flee to the west in the tens of thousands the mass exodus from east germany only worsened its economic conditions as young people skilled laborers and intellectuals vacated the country in droves the sed attempted to counteract this brain drain with aggressive propaganda campaigns framing the decision to leave east germany as an act of political and moral backwardness and depravity but there was nothing physically stopping people from leaving and so the exodus continued the task of halting this flow of immigration and reviving the economy fell to general secretary of the sed walter ulbrist in 1952 ulbrist decided that in order to accomplish this goal he needed to follow the example of the ussr by rapidly converting east germany into a proper communist society using a good old five-year plan in carrying out this plan ulbrist demonstrated that he had truly embraced the teachings of stalin by successfully starving his people even further and making everything much much worse his attempts to collectivize agriculture led to disastrous food shortages and the high taxes on private enterprise caused those consumer goods which had crept back onto the shelves to disappear once again the party tried to compensate for these new shortages by increasing worker quotas requiring 10 percent more effort to earn the same wages this last burden finally pushed people over the edge and hundreds of thousands more fled to the west in the summer of 1953 even after the soviets had forced oberus to dial back most of his collectivization efforts a workers strike broke out in east berlin which quickly grew into a protest demanding free elections and other reforms the movement soon spread across the country and within days 340 000 people were protesting in every city and almost every large town in east germany the situation was dire enough that ulbrist was forced to call on the soviets for help and it was only upon the arrival of their tanks and armed soldiers that the unrest was finally quelled and so migration to the west continued by the beginning of the 1960s nearly 4 million people had fled the gdr since its foundation representing over a quarter of the country's original population party officials tried several tactics to keep people from escaping including fortifying their border with west germany but citizens continued to flee through berlin due to its unusual status as a single city divided between soviet east and allied west it was difficult to stop people from crossing the border turning the former capital into a city-sized loophole through which over 90 percent of the migrants fleeing east germany were able to escape by 1961 the party had had enough and finally decided to close the border with the construction of the berlin wall this 156 kilometer or 97 mile barrier effectively cut off the people of east germany from the west where nearly 4 million had escaped since 1949 only 5 000 more would manage to abscond over the next 30 years as the 1960s progressed quality of life slowly improved in the gdr after losing a quarter of their number the remaining population of the nation slowly realized that there was no longer a shortage of housing or jobs production of consumer goods and strategic resources gradually increased and by the end of the decade east germany had the richest economy in the eastern bloc but while more goods were being produced not everything was consistently available the government was in control of all production the resulting fluctuations led to massive lines outside of stores and the widespread hoarding of common goods those without access to hard currency from the west were subject to the whims of the party's economic planners and often had to wait months or even years for certain goods to become available for example those wishing to purchase a sleek stylish high-performing east german automobile would have no trouble paying for it but they would have to wait up to 13 years to actually receive their vehicle despite the long waits standards of living in east germany did improve significantly in the 1960s but unrest and opposition to the communist government remained despite ongoing discontent there was never another widespread rebellion like the 1953 uprising until the soviet union began to collapse this effective suppression of unrest was all thanks to the ministry of state security also known as the stasi the stasi was one of the most feared secret police forces in the eastern bloc and between their founding in 1950 and their disillusion after german reunification they carried out one of the most extensive mass surveillance programs in the pre-digital age they employed over 170 000 informants among the civilian population although some estimates suggest there could have been as many as half a million there were stasi agents in every apartment building every factory every hospital and university watching and listening for any sign of subversive or anti-communist behavior until 1970 dissidents identified by this surveillance network were simply arrested dragged off somewhere and tortured until they gave up any accomplices before being imprisoned in the 1970s the stasi decided that these methods were too crude and began to employ a form of psychological warfare called zeatzetson which literally means decomposition these insidious tactics and mass surveillance created a culture of suspicion and fear in much of the east german populace the eyes of the stasi were everywhere despite this pervasive fear of stasi surveillance and harsh state censorship a vibrant and distinct art and material culture flourished in the gdr the identity that developed within these restrictions was defined largely in opposition to the west emphasizing the ways in which the people of east germany were distinct from and of course superior to those in the west movies and plays produced by the state-owned studios and theaters celebrated the ordinary working-class heroes of socialism along with brave underdogs who fought against fascism and imperialism when it came to women's rights east germany rejected the traditional conservative gender roles still enforced in west germany in favor for greater autonomy for women in marriage and in the workplace birth control was more widely accepted and available and women were encouraged to participate in the workplace rather than remaining at home this anti-western pro-communist cultural movement took hold most strongly among the older generation while the youth as they often do chose to rebel in the late 1970s and 80s as the governments of both german nations were pushing for reconciliation and greater cooperation cultural influences from the west began to seep in and catch on with the younger generation punk and rock music became popular and tech savvy teenagers became fascinated by western video games this created a cultural divide in the gdr with the old guards still stubbornly in support of the communist system that kept them fed sheltered and employed while young educated east germans grew more and more fascinated with the west and opposed the status quo by 1989 discontent with the communist policies erupted into widespread protests for the first time since 1953 and this time the soviet army was in no position to intervene in november the berlin wall was taken down and the sed abolished the provision in the constitution guaranteeing communist control of the government the following year east and west germany were formally reunited the reunification of germany was met with approval from both sides of the old border but the divisions between the two halves of this new nation did not disappear overnight many factories in the east were closed and widespread unemployment reappeared for the first time in decades for many particularly less educated men who had lost the stable jobs they'd enjoyed in the communist era there was a sense that the west had finally won and the east was now getting left behind even to this day many germans in the east feel a sense of nostalgia for the days of the gdr when everyone enjoyed if not prosperity at least stability and solidarity within the communist system while most historians acknowledge that east germany was a repressive dictatorship there are still germans today who remember it fondly and identify more as east germans than germans as always it is impossible to

       " \" hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian today's video is on the amphibious invasion of sicily when the plan was first proposed by prime minister winston churchill and the british chiefs of staff it was met with astonishment this was the first large-scale offensive operation aimed at the european mainland since the fall of france in 1940 and despite the axis losing hundreds of thousands of troops in its last stand in north africa they were far from beaten supplies in the mediterranean theater were scarce and the idea of a new large-scale offensive seemed ludicrous to many before we begin a word from our sponsor vessie you don't have to land on the shores of sicily to know that wet shoes are the worst a deep puddle or a few inches of snow could turn your socks from warm

armchair historian to get 25 off of your new vesey shoes american generals naturally argued that an invasion of italy at this time would draw resources away from cross-channel operations into france something that the soviets had been demanding for months debate raged throughout the two-week conference at casablanca with churchill's stirring rhetoric about italy being the soft underbelly of europe eventually persuading the americans to consider his proposal thus operation husky was born a large-scale amphibious invasion from north africa to the island of sicily which could be used as a springboard for a subsequent attack on mainland italy general dwight d eisenhower was appointed supreme commander of operation husky but planning remained primarily in the hands of british general harold alexander general alexander's plan of attack was simple land on the southern tip of sicily and capture the large port of syracuse then drive north to cut off an axis retreat at messina which was also a logistical staging point for any future invasion of italy the british would take center stage in the assault with the american forces operating in a supporting role something they weren't particularly happy about to reach syracuse the allies would need to cross the ponte grande bridge over the river anako but given its strategic importance the italians undoubtedly prepared to destroy the bridge at first sign of invasion left with no other options general alexander authorized a risky airborne operation to capture the bridge ahead of the main invasion on the night of july 9th 1943 a large formation of gliders and transport planes entered axis airspace over the isle of sicily but with winds gusting at over 45 miles or 72 kilometers an hour the ambitious airborne assault quickly turned into a confused mess anti-aircraft batteries and searchlights added to the chaos leading to 65 of the 147 gliders being released prematurely by their towing aircraft many of which plunged straight into the ocean of the remainder only 12 landed near their objectives and the rest were scattered far and wide across the sicilian countryside had the axis forces been better prepared operation husky might now be considered one of the biggest disasters of the second world war but many factors transpired to give the allies an easier time than they arguably deserved sicily was defended by the entire italian sixth army backed up by several german divisions amounting to over three hundred thousand men accompanied by several hundred tanks and over a thousand aircraft but italian morale was at an all-time low following the loss of north africa and the bulk of the sixth army was made up of coastal and support divisions that had minimal combat experience and little incentive to stand and fight furthermore senior italian general alfredo guzani and german field marshal albert kesselring were constantly at odds over every detail of the defense thanks to this bickering and the loss of north africa the remaining german soldiers in sicily had grown to despise their italian counterparts and now refused to coordinate with them the tentative nature of the axis hold on sicily was plainly illustrated when a ragged group of 50 british paratroopers made their way to ponte grande bridge after scrounging up a meager handful of supplies with no expectations of success the men fired off a few half-hearted volleys at the entrenched defenders only to watch in astonishment as the terrified italians leapt from their bunkers and vanished into the night scenes like this were repeated across the island with paratroopers causing havoc by cutting telephone wires intercepting message couriers and attacking isolated coastal batteries as the next day dawned a fleet of transport ships made a daring rush through high seas towards the sicilian coastline lining their decks were the men of the us seventh army under george patton and the british eighth army under bernard montgomery once again the treacherous winds and natural obstacles such as offshore sandbars were as dangerous as enemy fire with several landing ships running aground or finding themselves blown helplessly off course however as previously stated enemy resistance was remarkably light with no significant force awaiting the allies on the beaches with no tanks or mobile infantry divisions to contest the landings the static defenses proved only temporary inconveniences when the confused and dispirited italian forces finally began to mobilize for a counter-attack on the beachheads they were easily repulsed by naval gunfire with approximately 53 000 men put ashore in the first wave the allies began their advance inland although puente grande bridge had already been recaptured by the italians the paratroopers held it long enough to delay the axis forces to destroy it and syracuse fell within a day by the 12th much of southern sicily was in allied hands the luftwaffe was being suppressed by strategic bombing raids and many allied officers were already preparing to celebrate a swift victory but then disaster almost struck when the british attempted a second major airborne operation to capture a bridge over the river cemento which blocked their northern advance towards the city of catania while the initial attack was successful the bridge was deep behind enemy lines and the isolated paratroopers had to hold out for three whole days before ground units could relieve them even after the bridge was secured fierce italian resistance stalled the advance into the northern half of the island for another week sicily would not be an easy victory after all with delays mounting friction developed between the two halves of the invasion force the american seventh army had been intended to provide support from the flanks but was otherwise expected to hang back while the british 8th army did most of the fighting to say this situation was not to general patton's liking would be a vast understatement so he began badgering general alexander for permission to break out to the western side of the island unable to endure patton's pestering alexander reluctantly mumbled that patton could conduct a limited reconnaissance mission naturally patton interpreted this as permission to charge the entire seventh army west at breakneck speed leaving montgomery to continue trudging north in the face of increasingly stiff enemy resistance while patton was busy crushing the remnants of the italian army stationed in western sicily field marshal kesselring was preparing his final defensive line in the mountainous terrain south of messina this was known as the aetna line as it included the giant volcano mount aetna as one of its key defensive components both sides knew that whoever controlled the mountain slopes could decide the course of the battle and fighting in the area was intense montgomery planned to capture the town of adrano which linked the two halves of the aetna line together around the base of the volcano but adreno was still well behind enemy lines and to get there the allies had to battle their way through some of the harshest terrain since the deserts of north africa the first major clash on the road to mount aetna occurred at the town of chen turipe situated atop a line of extremely steep hills that gave a commanding view of the surrounding countryside and provided a nearly impregnable defensive position for the elite german falsehood or paratrooper regiment stationed there on august 2nd a heavy artillery barrage managed to destroy or dislodge the defenders from several of their hilltop fortifications but chen to repay itself remained defiant left with no other choice the men of the british 78th infantry division pushed forwards across broken rocky terrain constantly being hit by mortar fire and german snipers entering the town the battered infantrymen found themselves confronted by a pair of panzer 3s that had been hidden in the narrow streets with no armored support of their own the men of the 78th played hide and seek with these deadly opponents finally surrounding and destroying them with piazz anti-tank weapons yet even without their tanks the outnumbered falsehood yeagers held out for two whole days as the british were sweating up the steep hills around shen turipe general patton had finished rolling up the western half of sicily and was now assaulting the town of tronia which was also part of the aetna line once again the extreme terrain made for a difficult advance with extensive minefields making the unsteady ground even more treacherous to patton's great annoyance his forces were unable to achieve any easy breakthroughs and had to settle into an arduous routine of slowly prying the enemy off their fortified hilltops one by one the german and italian forces were not content to simply hold the line either launching numerous counter-attacks that often manage to regain ground and reoccupy old positions the assault on trenia lasted until august 6th and just like chen turipe the allies were unable to prevent the germans from making an orderly withdrawal that same day adrino was occupied by the 78th division and just like that the aetna line was finally broken and the end of the campaign was in sight in fact axis forces were already in the process of evacuating from sicily castle ring was under no illusions about his chances of holding the island for much longer and had little reason to stand and fight after the loss of catania and its airfields on the fifth beginning on august 11th a massive fleet of transport ships assembled at the port of messina right at the northern tip of sicily with rearguard units delaying the allied advance more than 100 000 german and italian soldiers were able to cross the straits of messina and escape into italy despite the fierce fighting the battle for sicily had been a remarkably bloodless affair of the nearly 500 000 allied soldiers involved only one percent were killed in action the germans lost about twenty six thousand men with ten thousand taken captive and the rest killed or wounded almost the entire italian sixth army surrendered and one hundred thousand men became prisoners of war the invasion also convinced italy's grand council of fascism to capitulate and by the middle of july they voted mussolini out of power and began seeking terms of surrender for an instant it seemed as if churchill had been correct and the soft underbelly of europe was about to be laid open with a single decisive strike but instead the allies had unknowingly committed themselves to an agonizing slog up the italian peninsula where thousands of lives would be wasted in pursuit of a quick victory that would never materialize join us next time when we take a look at this final campaign in italy which lasted right up until the final axis surrender in may of 1945 thanks again to our

to the iraqi people even when president george bush gave iraq his famous 48-hour ultimatum iraqi leader saddam hussein remained convinced that u.s forces lacked the capacity to wage more than a limited military campaign against his country saddam and his generals were well aware of past american failures such as the infamous black hawk down incident during the somali civil war saddam had also studied the conflict in vietnam and hoped to replicate the success of the north vietnamese by bogging down any invasion with defensive attritional warfare with graphic scenes of destruction plastered across american tv screens saddam expected popular opinion to quickly turn against the conflict until coalition forces withdrew in disgrace yet as we will see many factors conspired to doom the iraqi war effort long before the first shots were fired chief amongst these factors were saddam's legendary paranoia which made men like joseph stalin seem completely sane by comparison his direct preparations for the war were greatly surpassed by his efforts to completely lock down the iraqi populace pouring huge resources into the state security apparatus and surveillance programs many of the intelligence organizations that saddam created were in fact tasked primarily with spying on each other being late to the blame game was fatal and so these various agencies spent months merrily chasing phantoms and inventing elaborate conspiracy theories naturally the sentence for being accused in this web of lies and intrigue was always the same death predictably this insanity had a profound effect on the military readiness of the country saddam valued loyalty above all other traits and divided his forces into three groups based on their perceived trustworthiness these were the regular army the republican guard and finally the special republican guard or srg visits between officers of different army groups were forbidden and joint operations were unthinkable one srg commander recalled after the war we never coordinated with the republican guard i had no relation with any other units or fighting forces no other units were ever allowed near our unit no visits between other officers ever allowed in saddam's mind the only possible reason two officers of differing units would ever want to talk to each other would be to discuss a coup yet despite their highly dysfunctional leadership the average iraqi soldier strode into battle with a surprising degree of misplaced confidence for years the army was blasted with religious rhetoric promising that the infidel americans would soon fall before the sword of islam the prevailing attitude among the military was that the u.s was a paper tiger able to emit a terrifying war but incapable of enduring any serious losses since his successful coup in the late 1960s saddam hussein had ruled iraq at the head of the arab socialist baathist party which functioned as the central government and controlled all aspects of state policy given his unusually long reign an entire generation of iraqis had grown up having experienced nothing but saddam's dictatorship so few could imagine a world without their tyrannical leader exercising absolute power over their daily lives [Music] however despite saddam's oppression it is surprising how outright hostile the average iraqi citizen was towards their supposed american liberators for 12 years america was only ever known as the distant oppressor raining terror from the skies via airstrikes and subverting iraqi culture by funding insurrectionist movements meanwhile the few natives who benefited from western education experienced decades of villainization and dehumanization at the hands of the baathist party who painted them as traitors who sold out their own country for american petro dollars many iraqis were further distrustful of america after its behavior during the iran iraq war when it had cheered saddam on as an indispensable ally in the middle east only to turn on his regime as soon as he threatened american interests in kuwait saddam's regime also possessed a natural heir of legitimacy thanks to his close ties to islam this was due to his extensive program of mosque building throughout iraq and decades spent manipulating his citizens into a state of unquestioning religious devotion even those muslims that hated their dictator still viewed his regime as inherently preferable to a democratic state especially one subject to degenerate western influences this was a concept that the u.s was simply unaccustomed to dealing with and led to many problems further down the line a second and arguably far more important factor that the u.s failed to consider was the ideological divide between the two major branches of islam the sunni and the shia the reigning baathist party consisted primarily of sunni muslims while the neighboring iran had undergone a revolution in 1979 that resulted in the creation of a shia controlled islamic republic fearful of a similar revolution in iraq saddam brutally oppressed his shia subjects excluding them from positions of authority and conducting mass executions whenever there was any hint of rebellion but such tyrannical measures while effective in the short term served only to stoke the fires of sectarian violence that would blaze out of control almost from the moment that u.s forces stepped across the border much of the chaos following the invasion could have been avoided had the invading coalition forces drafted a feasible plan for bringing stability in the wake of a regime change sadly this was not the case and civil disorder quickly became the order of the day with shia militant groups seeking vengeance on their former sunni oppressors troubles peaked in the capital city of baghdad which fell into a state of virtual anarchy following its capture shopkeeper muhammad abbas who had fled the city as the americans approached said when i got back to baghdad it was not the city i had left just a week before you saw people walking everywhere carrying looted goods nowhere could you see any sign of law and order no police no military no government nothing everything had collapsed the feelings of betrayal amongst the civilian population perhaps reached their peak after the al tabol raid in early 2004 when u.s forces entered and ransacked a mosque whose imam had recently begun preaching anti-american rhetoric and providing bomb-making lessons to would-be insurgents although a large cache of weapons and explosives were uncovered during the raid muslims across iraq were horrified by the images of the desecrated holy place with furniture smashed and copies of the sacred quran scattered across the floor to add insult to injury the americans offered no apology instead merely publishing a list of the seized items and brushing off the affair as just another routine operation against saddam's forces extremist clerics were quick to jump at this golden opportunity decrying the occupiers as devils whose sole purpose was to wage a war against the faithful of islam to aid this narrative terrorists and militia groups attacked coalition bases dressed as civilians forcing american soldiers to treat everyone as a potential threat this created a vicious cycle of mutual distrust each act of bad faith on one side triggering retaliation by the other which only led to further escalation given how volatile the situation was coalition forces quickly announced a provisional government to provide a peaceful transition to democracy but when the members of the new iraqi governing council were revealed the public was shocked to discover that it consisted of 13 shias and only 10 sunnis five of whom were kurdish minorities to the americans this was simply a matter of proportional representation after all the shias were the majority however to the sunni loyalists of iraq the site of the coalition raising up a government led by shiites and kurds was proof that saddam's anti-western rhetoric had been right all along the situation was not helped by the behavior of some opportunistic shia who quickly stepped in to fill the void left by their sunni counterparts to quote sunni government employee abu mustafa all of these senior officials had simply vanished and soon we began to see a new sectarian order people claiming to be doing the bidding of the shiite religious authorities began to fill the posts left open by the vanished baathists they began verbally abusing and firing sunnis or anyone they distrusted fortunately for america there was still one organization that had a solid plan for dealing with the rising tensions in iraq the cia in the aftermath of the invasion the cia was in charge of tracking down and capturing as many members of the former iraqi intelligence agencies as possible their efforts eventually succeeded when they rounded up a huge cabal of both party loyalists many of whom openly admitted to torture murder and various criminal activities having listened carefully to the various testimonies made against these men the cia quickly concluded that there was only one reasonable course of action to immediately offer them their jobs back and rebuild the core of saddam's police state from the ground up the cia rationalized this decision with the logic that under saddam terrorist activity in the region had been kept to a minimum and therefore there was nothing intrinsically wrong with his methods only his goals with all the worst aspects of the old regime now being restored by the very people claiming to be their liberators the iraqi people were finally pushed over the edge an explosion of violence rocked the nation and the capital city was divided up into warring sunni and shia suburbs the occupiers could do little but watch as chaos engulfed the nation their efforts to help constantly roadblocked by radicalism of their own inability to understand iraqi culture this bitterness and mistrust created an atmosphere where coalition soldiers saw danger around every corner the political vacuum left by saddam's defeat also allowed many extremist organizations to gain a significant foothold in the middle east turning the country into a war zone between government forces and radical militias by 2006 the violence had escalated into a full-scale civil war that saw the attempts of ethnic cleansing by both sunnis and shias resulting in the displacement of several million people to this day iraq remains one of the most unstable countries on earth with american forces being withdrawn in 2011 only to return in 2014 to combat the growing power of isis in the region faced with endless threats both external and internal the fragile democratic state now ruling the nation is constantly hamstrung by the meddling of foreign intelligence agencies and the deep bitter divisions amongst its populace but with isis finally losing its territory in the country in 2017 some still cling to the faint hope that iraq may finally be regaining its footing as a modern nation even so there is still much work left to be done thanks again to conflict of nations for sponsoring this video clicking the link down below

headquarters of the iraqi third corps caught in a hastily prepared ambush 15 of the 18 vehicles were destroyed by heavy weapons fire and 18 us soldiers were killed or captured but these strategic bridges over nessiri's modestly named saddam canal were secured later that day after men from the second marine division stormed the city suffering heavy casualties from the determined iraqi defenders as if the intense urban combat wasn't enough six marines were also killed in a friendly fire incident when an a10 warthog mistakenly attacked their amphibious vehicle finally on the evening of march 24th the marines broke through and established a perimeter north of the city which held up despite multiple counter-attacks by iraqi forces and the fedaying saddam militia who were fanatical not only about saddam but apparently also about darth vader further north was the town of najaf which was situated close to highways leading to the important cities of karbala and baghdad due to its strategic location coalition forces decided not to bypass najaf and instead chose to isolate the town out of fears it could become a staging area for attacks against american supply lines to accomplish this the coalition needed to capture the bridges to the north and south of the town elements of the first brigade combat team attacked the northern bridge codenamed jenkins in the early hours of march 25th but made slow progress until they linked up with reinforcements before dawn the americans eventually fought their way across the bridge despite desperate attempts by iraqi engineers to destroy it around the same time us forces advanced on the southern bridge codenamed objective floyd resistance by both regular military and militia forces was intense at both sites on one occasion an iraqi drove a city bus at full speed into an m3 bradley cfv on march 26th najaf was successfully encircled and the attackers were relieved by the 101st airborne over the next several days the americans swept through the town with tanks and infantry the hundred and first deliberately left a single road out of the city open in the hope of using it as a kill zone for escaping troops on april first some weary iraqi soldiers took the bait and were ambushed by snipers and helicopter gunships and the city ultimately fell on april 4th to the south british forces had an unexpectedly difficult time taking basra and its nearby port starting on march 27th they whittled down the iraqi garrison defending the valuable port over the course of two weeks when they finally gained control of the vital waterway only 11 britons had died while the iraqis had lost some 40 to 50 times that number when british armor finally rolled into the city they were welcomed by jubilant locals as predicted by u.s secretary of defense donald rumsfeld unfortunately however the crowds quickly turned into mobs of looters the final major engagement before coalition forces arrived in baghdad was at the battle of karbala gap a roughly 25 mile or 40 kilometer long strip of land flanked by the euphrates and rizaza rivers iraqi commanders were well aware of the gap's strategic importance and had placed two divisions of the elite republican guard to block the americans advance however saddam hussein's son crusade severely weakened the defense by redirecting some of them to the north which proved to be a fatal mistake on april 1 american troops broke through the gap reaching the euphrates at the city of museeb though several iraqi armored divisions counter-attacked on the night of april 3rd they were driven back by aircraft and rocket fire and the coalition held on to the important bridgehead with the path to baghdad forced open and victory on the horizon a last bloody struggle for the capital began while the iraqi army had almost completely disintegrated at this point the baffist party militias holding the city did not hesitate to utilize underhanded tactics to slow the coalition advance after extended skirmishes with the defenders colonel david perkins launched a surprise thunder run of nearly 30 tanks straight into the city on april 5th once behind enemy lines the column came under intense fire from militiamen disguised as civilians but perkins was able to identify their defensive positions and execute a fighting withdrawal u.s marines then stormed the diyala bridge on the eastern side of the city and advanced along the northern bank of the euphrates aware that this flank was almost entirely undefended the nervous troops fired on any car refusing to halt out of fear of suicide bombers amidst this carnage perkins led another thunder run into the heart of the capital on the 7th and rewarded himself by spending the night in one of saddam's opulent palaces after a final desperate defense by the militias the city was finally captured on april 9th there were some initial celebrations by iraqi civilians including widespread vandalism of statues and portraits depicting the now defeated saddam however as in basra massive waves of looting soon followed and continued until u.s forces cracked down on offenders but saddam himself proved elusive and would not be captured for many months coalition soldiers would spend their time securing the occupation and searching for other high-value government officials that had escaped the invasion but as the coalition searched for these officials violence between iraq's minority groups soon erupted and insurgents began to assemble nonetheless on may 1st 2003 off the coast of san diego president bush made a dramatic appearance landing on the aircraft carrier uss abraham lincoln the former air national guard aviator wore a flight suit for his televised address in front of a national audience standing in front of an enormous banner reading mission accomplished he announced the end of major combat operations in iraq at the time the proclamation seemed reasonable the iraqi military was in shambles and saddam hussein had been reduced from an autocrat to a fugitive but despite all appearances the troubles were just beginning for the next eight years the coalition was engaged in a protracted counter insurgency and suffered heavy casualties while many thousands of civilians lost their lives in 2003 the mission may have been accomplished and the brief conventional phase of fighting was indeed finished but much like in afghanistan the war in iraq had only just begun thanks again to our sponsor squarespace click their link below to support history content [Music] you\",\n",

saw hundreds of thousands of troops committed to an invasion that ended with the deposition of a dictator while we will cover some of the political background and context of this much discussed conflict this video will primarily focus on the combat maneuvers and objectives of the momentous invasion that sparked an eight-year occupation and insurgency but first if you haven't had the chance to check out our video on the first iraq war here is a quick recap after it ended with iraqi forces being expelled from kuwait the u.s soldiers sought to protect kurdish and shiite minorities in iraq by enforcing no-fly zones and launching airstrikes against strategic sites such as oil fields and military bases but following saddam hussein's repeated refusal to cooperate with un weapon inspectors the united states passed the iraqi liberation act which officially solidified the goal of regime change in the country at the time though this act simply consisted of providing millions of dollars to numerous opposition groups in the country with the hope of toppling saddam's government in late 2002 the united states began building a case against the baathist government of iraq and sought the support of the u.n security council on top of the claimed ties to al-qaeda the bush administration had a laundry list of justifications for armed intervention including the mistreatment of civilians and the aforementioned expulsion of un weapons inspectors perhaps for seeing how controversial these accusations would be in the future many in the un security council strenuously objected to the proposed invasion insisting that america pursue a diplomatic solution instead but even while the council debated cia teams were landing in iraq to lay the groundwork for a full-scale invasion the u.s had already made up its mind saddam's regime was doomed moving quickly members of the special activities division established contact with the kurdish peshmergas who opposed saddam then they began identifying key elements of iraqi leadership this intelligence would be used to devastating effect in the opening days of the conflict with surgical airstrikes killing many high-ranking officers additionally the special activities division captured a chemical weapons factory yet despite secretary of state colin powell's vivid descriptions of mobile weapons laboratories on the backs of trucks and train cars the facility was the only one of its kind found during the entire iraq war unsurprisingly these preemptive strikes did not help america's case to the u.n which continued to call for de-escalation key nato members such as france and canada were also highly vocal in condemning america's aggression opposition around the world mounted culminating with the largest recorded protest in human history when on february 15 2003 over 6 million people in 800 cities gathered to protest the war nevertheless in march of 2003 the united states and the coalition of the willing which included the united kingdom poland and australia among others began massing troops in the region unlike the war fought 12 years earlier they would be advancing without un approval the invasion began slowly the first phase consisted of numerous air strikes and covert raids on targets within the country with varying degrees of success one of the first of these was the battle of al qaeda on march 17th when units of the british special air service attacked a suspected chemical weapons site housed in a water treatment facility near the syrian border but the iraqi defenders put up an unexpectedly spirited defense and the commando team was forced to withdraw under heavy fire frustrated they called in an airstrike leveling the entire facility and obliterating any potential evidence that chemical weapons were being held in the facility another strike occurred two days later at a community just outside baghdad called dura farms believing that saddam was visiting his sons in the area the united states saturated the area with 8 000 pounds of ordnance and 40 tomahawk cruise missiles in an attempt to wipe the iraqi dictator off the face of the earth however every single satellite-guided warhead missed its target and as a result over a dozen civilians were injured and one killed to complete the debacle it was later discovered that saddam's last visit to the area had been nearly a decade ago despite these issues the main invasion was finally getting underway based on the precedent set in the first gulf war and afghanistan most observers had expected a lengthy period of aerial bombardment before any ground offensive however the coalition instead opted to launch a rapid air and ground campaign that would avoid most urban areas and focus on decapitating the iraqi government this tactic later called shock and awe was chosen for two reasons first american leaders assumed that if the command structure was eliminated organized resistance would disintegrate second it was hoped that the civilian population would support the americans as liberators secretary of defense donald rumsfeld was particularly optimistic about this stating there will be iraqis who offer not only to help us but to help liberate the country and free the iraqi people as we will see this wasn't totally the case on the night of march 19th members of the 160th airborne known as the nightstalkers destroyed more than 70 iraqi military outposts along the southern and western borders with the path cleared coalition forces advanced from kuwait in two prongs one directed north and one south a combined air and amphibious assault was also launched on the alpha peninsula on march 20th with the goal of securing the critical oil infrastructure located there american british and polish commandos all worked tirelessly to capture the offshore platforms before they could be sabotaged by the defenders despite significant resistance from entrenched iraqis supported by artillery fire the teams were able to secure the peninsula after a grueling three-day battle their efforts likely prevented a major ecological disaster and saved billions of dollars worth of equipment that saddam would otherwise have destroyed in a petty act of revenge unfortunately for the coalition this would be the last bit of good pr they would receive for quite some time as we'll see in the part 2 which is out right now the war for iraq was just beginning and even this initial taste of victory had been soured by the clumsy handling of al-qaeda and the disaster at dura farms while coalition casualties remained minimal intelligence failures would continue to plague future operations muddying the overall picture of the war in iraq to such an extent that many details remain unclear to this day thanks to blinkist for

withdrew to reinforce the garrison on the island of crete the defender's situation was dire from the moment they arrived as their rapid evacuation had forced them to leave behind most of their equipment nearly all heavy weapons and vehicles had been lost and ammunition was in short supply fortunately for the allies the royal navy remained firmly in control of the mediterranean rendering an amphibious invasion of crete impossible while german air superiority allowed for frequent bombing raids britain's naval dominance kept the island safe for a month following the invasion of greece in the meantime german high command began considering how to invade the island without naval superiority to many this simply was not feasible some wanted to focus their attention and resources for the imminent invasion of the soviet union and simply let the allies have the island but others including hitler were concerned about the danger british forces posed to access operations in the eastern mediterranean with crete as a base the british royal air force could attack naval convoys sent to resupply general erwin rommel's forces in north africa and their bombers could strike at the vital oil fields in romania playing on these concerns general kurt student commander of the luftwaffe's falsehood or paratroopers and his commander hermann goering heavily advocated for an aerial invasion of crete dropping airborne forces on mass to bypass the royal navy and seize control of the island their plan codenamed operation mercury was controversial and would be the first air based invasion in history though high command was skeptical adolf hitler eventually approved the plan on the condition that it did not interfere with the invasion of the soviet union the main objective of operation mercury was the capture of malime the largest airfield on crete taking it would allow the rapid deployment of supplies and reinforcements to secure the island and it was close enough to the greek mainland to allow land-based fighters to support the invasion other targets included two smaller airfields and the main port at suda bay the initial invasion force consisted of 750 glider-borne troops 10 000 paratroopers and 5 000 airlifted mountain infantry they were divided into three groups each dedicated to capturing one of the airfields group west the largest of the three was to drop first and capture malime before the others arrived guring and the other officers of the german navy wanted to focus overwhelming force at malime while student perhaps eager to demonstrate the ability of his paratroopers wanted to spread his men out across a wider front to surprise the enemy at multiple objectives little did he know the element of surprise had already been lost the british ultra program had long since broken the nazis enigma codes and the allies knew all of the details of the german plan almost as soon as it was made armed with this intelligence the defenders of crete dug in and prepared to defend the island shortly after dawn on may 20th a massive aerial bombardment of allied positions signaled the beginning of the invasion following the bombers and fighters a fleet of transport planes lumbered into view above malime dropping massive waves of paratroopers and supply canisters as the sky filled with parachutes and gliders the defenders took up arms and took advantage of one of the major risks of an airborne invasion until they landed the dreaded falsehood were nothing but a sea of targets in the sky hundreds were shot down before they touched ground while mortar shells destroyed most of the gliders as soon as they landed to make matters worse those paratroopers who survived were virtually unarmed their weapons had been dropped separately leaving them nothing but knives and pistols to defend themselves in the meantime this vulnerability was exploited to the fullest by the carefully positioned new zealand troops who inflicted heavy casualties on the paratroopers landing to the south and east of malimei before they even knew where they were out of the invasion force only group west managed to pursue their objective after landing in a dry riverbed from there they engaged the 22nd battalion and quickly began pushing back the poorly equipped new zealand troops fighting continued throughout the day and by sunset the paratroopers had managed to establish a tenuous foothold west of the malime airfield this was far less than student had hoped to accomplish and with none of their objectives captured german commanders in athens were concerned about the prospects of the invasion fortunately however what the germans could not accomplish themselves the allies were happy to do for them the soldiers of group west awoke the next morning only to find that the new zealanders in desperate need of ammunition and resources had withdrawn from their defensive positions overlooking the airfield the paratroopers wasted no time in taking advantage of this opportunity and seized the airfield soon german transport planes carrying fresh troops and supplies began landing and while long-range artillery fire damaged or destroyed dozens of them enough made it through to turn the tide of the invasion the allies recognized the gravity of the situation but their planned counter-attack that night was hampered by delays and hesitation at high levels when the 20th and 28th new zealand battalions finally began their assault in the early hours of may 22nd they were quickly bogged down by air attacks and by the afternoon they were forced to retreat the germans were now in firm control of the malime airfield and more were being flown in at a steady rate slowly the allied forces were pushed east then south over the next few days german forces cautiously advanced towards the port of souda bay bombing allied positions from the air before probing their defenses and attacking the beleaguered defenders where they were weakest by may 27th the germans had seized control of the main roads leading to the bay and suda's garrison along with that of the city of chania were beginning to falter facing intense aerial bombardment and an increasingly desperate supply situation the allies were forced to stage a full retreat the defenders headed for the southern beaches of svakia where the royal navy would evacuate them to egypt the retreating troops could only move at night for fear of bombing and strafing by the luftwaffe during the day the march was brutal but most managed to maintain cohesion during the crossing while australian and new zealand forces in the 5th and 19th brigades held off the pursuing germans despite operating at roughly half strength and with very little ammunition the anzac forces in the rear guard fought on and on the morning of the 27th they managed to halt the enemy advance with an old-fashioned bayonet charge this engagement became known as the battle of 42nd street and it bought commonwealth forces precious time to make it over the mountains and begin their evacuation over the next four days the royal navy extracted thousands of soldiers from the southern coast of crete with the pursuing germans following closely the new zealand rear guard continued to hold the enemy back as long as they could but they were gradually pushed back closer and closer to the beaches of svakya where the evacuations were taking place on the morning of june 1st the germans arrived at the beaches to find about 5 000 soldiers left behind the rest were on their way to egypt tired hungry and finally cornered the remaining defenders surrendered bringing the battle of crete to an end throughout the battle german forces faced heavy resistance from the civilian population villagers shot at the invaders with rifles taken from local museums paratroopers were stabbed and clubbed upon landing and armed civilian mobs even joined in several counter-attacks by the greek army during the retreat this was the first time that the nazis had experienced such extensive resistance from a civilian population and they did not take it well reprisals and massacres against the cretan people were frequent and bloody prompting the birth of the cretan resistance just two weeks after the battle came to a conclusion while the battle for crete ended in a victory for the german invaders the price they paid was extensive six thousand men were killed and nearly 300 aircraft were destroyed these staggering losses led adolf hitler to conclude that the paratroopers could no longer exploit the element of surprise and they would therefore never be used ever again in a large-scale airborne invasion after the war general student would refer to crete as the graveyard of the paratroopers thanks again to call of war

       " \" in early october 1940 the chief of the italian general staff pietro bedolio was ordered by mussolini to begin preparing for the invasion of greece and on the 28th using the recently annexed albania as a base the italian vanguard of two divisions advanced into the pindis mountains from the outset progress was slower than anticipated and within 11 days the greeks had stopped the invasion dead in its tracks and to make matters worse the italian logistical system collapsed by the 14th of november the greeks had pushed the italians back to the border and began a unified counter-offensive which shattered the italian line and threw them into a panic in some places the greeks penetrated as far as 50 kilometers or 31 miles into albania the counter-offensive only ended after the greeks lost momentum and a stalemate then ensued which would only be broken in april by the germans this leads us to today's question how did the greeks manage to repel an invasion by a seemingly much stronger power before we begin i'd like to thank our sponsor for today's video squarespace whether you're looking to start an online business create a community hub or most commonly

recreate the roman empire were hindered by the poor performance of the italian military in the second world war and this was just one major reason why italy was more or less reduced to a german client state as the conflict continued more so than in any other campaign the italian invasion of greece which ended with a bailout from the germans cemented this dependent relationship in many ways italy's invasion of greece was an attempt to imitate the expansionist policies of their german ally up to this point italy's only conquests had been in ethiopia and albania while italian participation in the second world war had been limited to the french alps and north africa but mussolini was a man of boundless ambition and had become convinced that the fastest method of securing dominance over the mediterranean lay in the annexation of greece from the outset italian logistics and maneuverability were compromised by the harsh climate of the pindus mountains combined with an unusually cold winter by december conditions were nearly arctic foreshadowing what was in store for their german allies one year later pack animals quickly began dying of hypothermia and tens of thousands of men on both sides developed frostbite but these were not insurmountable obstacles and the hardy italians were no strangers to bad weather or rough terrain they also possessed a substantial number of tanks modern infantry weapons and a strong air corps in contrast the majority of greek troops had to make do with a truly archaic arsenal consisting mostly of equipment left over from the great war furthermore the axis stranglehold over europe cut them off from ships of ammunition or spare parts in terms of air power the only force the greeks could muster consisted of a mere 79 planes yet despite their advantages the italians would soon find that the armor which had proved instrumental in the deserts of ethiopia were useless in the pindus mountains meanwhile the air force that had terrorized the republicans in the spanish civil war would be given a harsh lesson in humility by the british raf which flew many sorties in defense of greek airspace from the island of crete during the invasion the british were also able to supply the greeks with accurate and reliable intelligence on enemy troop movements and strategic objectives thanks to having cracked italian military encryption protocols the character of the italian military establishment was also a major contributor to the disaster a culture of mistrust created bitter personal feuds in which generals were more concerned with humiliating each other than they were with defeating the enemy inter-service rivalries were just as severe with each branch cooperating as little as possible out of fear that doing so would undermine their own political relevance [Music] this was not helped by internal competition for the limited resources they had to work with as italy was a largely agrarian country which unlike germany did not have large occupied territories to plunder these issues prevented the use of the combined arms tactics that their german allies had used so successfully in france and in poland italian generals were also astonishingly unwilling to consider new tactics preferring instead to believe that properly motivated and equipped infantry units could accomplish anything in sufficient numbers this attitude was highlighted when italian observers compiled a detailed and insightful report on german tactics and handed it to chief of staff badoglio only for him to promptly dismiss it with the words we'll study it when the war is over but contrary to popular perception the italian army was not wholly incompetent the issue did not lie with the morale or training of the average soldier but instead lay in the systemic failures of the military establishment as a whole even erwin rommel noted that when given proper leadership the italian troops under his command displayed incredible bravery but this quote from the war diary of a disgruntled italian general underlines the lack of foresight or strategic planning that went in to the campaign someone will say in 15 days we must be ready to march against yugoslavia or in eight days we will attack greece from albania as easily as saying let's have a cup of coffee the duche hasn't the least idea of the differences between preparing war on flat terrain or in mountains in summer or in winter still less does he worry about the fact that we lack weapons ammunition equipment animals raw materials the factors we've discussed so far though important were not enough to guarantee an italian failure that was guaranteed by the resolve displayed by the greek people before the war greece was a nation suffering from many internal divisions prime minister ioannis matexus had been a veteran of the great war who had taken to politics after becoming alarmed by the growing communist movement among the greek peasantry but after failing to secure popular support the texas was appointed prime minister by the king of greece george ii shortly thereafter matexus used the threat of a communist uprising to abolish parliament and establish himself as an authoritarian dictator but despite the fact that his regime was deeply unpopular the texas was a genius propagandist whose total control over the greek media allowed him to spin a narrative of italian cowardice and incompetence then on august 15th weeks before the declaration of war an italian submarine torpedoed a greek light cruiser this coincided with a major festival to the virgin mary and the pious greeks reacted by elevating the deceased crew to the status of religious martyrs the texas could not have wished for a more perfect opportunity and the state propaganda machines went into overdrive whipping the nation into a patriotic frenzy for the coming righteous conflict against the vile italian oppressors the subsequent tenacity with which the greeks resisted invasion was seen on numerous occasions such as the battle of hill 731 in which an entire italian division supported by an armored element was repeatedly repulsed by a single battalion of greeks defending an important mountain pass this act of heroism has often been called the modern thermopylae and ultimately caused the italian spring offensive to be cancelled yet despite their numerous successes the greeks were ultimately doomed by factors beyond their control even with british aid their army had effectively run out of supplies by march of 1941. war materiel captured from the retreating italians provided only a temporary solution and by the time the germans invaded the vermont faced an enemy that barely had enough ammunition for a month of sustained fighting in total at least 250 000 greek reservists never even saw combat as their country lacked the means to provide them with so much as a pair of boots as the mainland collapsed the government withdrew to the island of crete one of the last targets of the german balkan campaign british greek and anzac forces would be tested against over 20 000 airborne troops in the largest airborne invasion up to that point hitler would go on to blame the invasions of greece and yugoslavia for the failure of operation barbarossa allegedly stating if the italians hadn't attacked greece and needed our help the war would have taken a different course while the fuhrer may have been exaggerating there is no doubt that the conflict in southern europe was a significant drain on the limited resources of the axis given all of the evidence discussed so far it's easy to see how the italian invasion was doomed from the start italian strategists ignored every lesson of modern warfare pushing troops into battle with neither the equipment nor the support they needed to accomplish their mission in the end individual heroism could not compensate for the abject failures of the italian military establishment and even after greece finally capitulated its remaining soldiers took up arms in the british army of north africa while many civilians fought as partisans forming one of the strongest and most effective resistance movements of the war thanks

       " \" it is a cold morning in the winter of 1861 and a northern lawyer is enjoying breakfast by the fireplace he reaches for the morning issue of the new york times hoping for news on the conflict with the rebels all the papers have been fixated on the diplomatic incident last month with the united kingdom a ship smuggling rebel ambassadors had been intercepted by the union but surely the situation can't be as serious as the paper suggests the affair will probably be resolved in the coming days but as the lawyer begins reading the paper he is shocked the front page story is much

history content [Music] even before the first shots were fired on fort sumter foreign powers were watching the secession crisis in the united states very closely the us in 1861 wasn't the global superpower it is today but it was integral to the increasingly interconnected economies of the world in addition america represented the still uncertain experiment of democracy in the eyes of europe if the united states fell apart it would make a strong case for the instability and danger of democratic reforms with that being said direct involvement in the far away american war was not viable for most states in europe sending men and materiel across the atlantic was simply impractical for all but the largest empires and europe had no shortage of conflicts of its own to deal with that being said many countries did get involved indirectly so let's run through some of them now before we take a deep dive into the two nations who are closest to intervening first we have the shrinking papal state ruled by pope pius ix in 1862 a confederate ambassador met with the pope to convince him of the righteousness of the southern cause the ambassador came away from the meeting utterly convinced he had won pius over despite having to admit neither he nor confederate president jefferson davis was catholic and outright refusing the pontiff's suggestion that the confederacy consent to gradual emancipation of its slaves the pope later wrote a letter to davis which was enthusiastically mistranslated as a formal recognition of the confederate states of america as an independent nation which was soon turned into wartime propaganda the next nation on our list is the kingdom of prussia several prussians were sent to fight in or observe the war on both sides and throughout the civil war these prussian officers were consistently impressed with themselves by comparison to what they saw as disorganized and poorly trained american armies in particular captain justice scheiber scoffed at how little formal training both sides had given their officers before the war scheiber and other prussians did take note of the advances in engineering and defensive tactics made during the war but attributed most of their success to the vastly different terrain and other circumstances unique to north america while many prussian-born officers did observe or command in the conflict the kingdom as a whole was most concerned with unifying germany and was not significantly influenced by the civil war coming away from their observations more certain than ever of their own superiority further west the dwindling spanish empire took the civil war as an opportunity to reclaim some of its lost american colonies and occupied the dominican republic in 1861 the spanish faced resistance almost immediately and in 1863 full-scale rebellion began soon spain had lost control of all but the capital of santo domingo and they unsuccessfully fought the rebellion for two more years before withdrawing completely others sided more firmly with the union on the italian peninsula the leaders of the mighty empire of san marino wrote to president lincoln to show support of his cause and to offer lincoln's citizenship lincoln gratefully replied accepting the offer and establishing the first diplomatic relations between the u.s and san marino as for the kingdom of italy they were far more concerned with consolidating their new territory finally to the east the russian empire which saw a strong united states as an important counterweight to the british empire vocally supported the union but it never extended an offer of military aid like the rest of europe's leaders the russians were unwilling to entangle themselves in a bloody faraway conflict on another continent the only two nations that came anywhere close to getting involved were the british and french empires in both nations public opinion was largely divided along class lines the land owners tended to support the wannabe aristocrats of the south while the middle and working classes tended to support the union this is a bit of an oversimplification but while the public discourse surrounding the conflict was nuanced and varied it also was almost entirely irrelevant people hotly debated and the newspapers printed countless think pieces and exposes and yet the decisions about whether europe would intervene in the american civil war were made by a mere handful of powerful figures in france emperor napoleon iii the nephew of the far more successful napoleon bonaparte sought to expand the territory and influence of the french empire around the world this initially led him to see the american civil war as an opportunity ever since 1823 the american monroe doctrine had prevented the european powers from extending their influence into the western hemisphere but with the house now divided against itself the americans were once again vulnerable to european exploitation a mere eight months after the civil war broke out napoleon invaded the republic of mexico his army swiftly toppled the government and installed an austrian noble as emperor maximilian the first of mexico u.s officials were outraged about this but there was nothing they could do as long as the confederates controlled the mexican border eager to protect his new puppet napoleon wanted to recognize the independence of the confederacy but union diplomats made it very clear that recognition of the rebels would lead to all-out war and france was unwilling to take the risk without allies and with the growing kingdom of prussia waiting to strike in europe napoleon decided not to go to war without the support of britain unfortunately for napoleon that support was unlikely as the leaders of britain had few reasons to get involved while prime minister lord palmerston and other ministers were sympathetic to the confederacy the cabinet recognized that it was not economical for them to go to war british financial institutions were heavily invested in railways and other projects with union territory and northern states of the us were some of the chief importers of british and french luxury and manufactured goods furthermore by 1861 40 of great britain's wheat imports came from the union france was similarly reliant on union food imports and napoleon iii was no doubt wary of having to tell a hungry french populace let them eat cotton both nations did have economic ties to the south with southern cotton fueling much of the british and french textile industries unlike northern grain and trade markets however southern cotton could be replaced both countries had built up sizable stockpiles by 1861 and when the surplus ran out subsequent cotton shortages were offset by imports from the british territories of egypt and india besides economics diplomacy also played a major role in keeping europe out of the civil war confederate diplomats were inexperienced and clumsy chosen by president davis for personal and political reasons rather than for diplomatic skill davis was convinced that all he had to do was dangle the south's great king cotton before the european powers who would then eagerly offer their support the union meanwhile engaged in more skillful and subtle diplomacy which culminated in the diplomatic master stroke that was lincoln's emancipation proclamation by announcing to the world that the union was fighting to end the institution of slavery he effectively made the civil war a moral conflict by making this narrative clear lincoln ensured that politicians in europe could not express their support for the confederacy without being seen as pro-slavery as a result of these economic and diplomatic factors there was never a serious push within the british government to get the empire involved with the civil war the closest the empire ever came to intervening was the trent affair when two confederate diplomats attempting to travel to europe aboard a british ship were intercepted and seized by the union navy the boarding of a british vessel and the abduction of its passengers infuriated the british public parliament and cabinet and a demand for the prisoner's release and a full apology was immediately sent to washington dc meanwhile thousands of additional troops were dispatched to canada and the royal navy was placed on high alert president lincoln recognized the danger and promptly complied with the british demand releasing the diplomats and issuing a vague faux apology to satisfy the british aside from the close call of the trent affair no european nation ever came close to intervening in the american civil war even if the combined might of britain and france could have changed the course of the war they were both ultimately deterred from involvement by the skillful diplomacy of the union and of course economic concerns although there were factions in europe that supported the confederacy in a rare moment practical considerations outweighed ideology in the end the nations of europe chose to leave the american civil war to the americans thanks again to raid shadow legends for making this video possible

such as baden bavaria and wurttemberg fights a war for unification against the second french empire the many culturally distinct kingdoms duchies and principalities whose only commonality is language for the most part form into a single nation state the german empire by the end paris is surrounded and napoleon iii is captured embracing the military aesthetics of the period including brightly colored uniforms the most iconic feature of this era in german military history is the picklehauba or pointed helmet the helmet is actually one of the first pieces of modular gear issued to soldiers on mass with the spike being attached via a screw thread that makes it easy to remove and replace with other decorations signifying different ranks or positions given the size of the german confederation before unification many different firearms are in use such as the prussian breech-loading dresser needle gun the bavarian portabilts gun the saxon jaeger bulsha m1865 and many others but the ambitions of germany in the 19th century extend far beyond the shores of europe a single glance at the german colonial uniforms immediately shows a much greater commitment to practicality over style with drab colors and simple designs featuring minimal decoration to distinguish officers from enlisted men the expensive picohaba is often replaced by a slouch hat with a prominent cockade while practical additions such as bandoliers and adjustable pouches are much more common sights like other colonial powers germany makes extensive use of native levees known as ascaris these men wear even simpler uniforms made of khaki in contrast to the more expensive corduroy worn by german troops stationed in the colonies officers who could actually afford to have their clothes laundered on a regular basis still wear more elaborate outfits made of white or gray wool with decorative piping on their wrists to distinguish themselves from the common soldiers lastly the german troops operating in east asia wear khaki uniforms that are adopted from several other designs and recolored to help men deal with local temperatures as we move into the great war we immediately see a reduction in flamboyant decorations and bright eye-catching colors such as blue and green the pickle haba remained standard issue until 1916 but the leather construction is simplified to one of sheet steel which simultaneously gives better resistance to shrapnel and other hazards within just a few months the need to simplify uniforms for mass production has completely overtaken even the most long-established army traditions and there is little to distinguish the officers besides a few details the picohaba is still worn during ceremonial occasions but most officers prefer simple caps known as feldmutsa during 1916 a new simpler all-metal helmet known as the stalhelm starts to replace the picklehauba as the standard infantry headgear meanwhile the gewehr 98 has become the standard issue rifle a bolt action design that would remain in service until 1935 at which point it is replaced by the carabiner 98k the next year we'll see the issuing of canister gas masks which limits the effects of chemical warfare and the steelhand granata will make its first appearance also of note is the mp18 carried by the stormtroopen this is one of the first submachine guns issued to troops in large numbers but after its defeat in the first world war this is what the german army looked like well besides for the 100 000 soldiers down from the 1.9 million in the first world war that they were allowed to keep for defense purposes these men were part of the reichswear or realm defense force and their uniforms are as basic as you might expect by now the stalham has completely replaced the picohaba and apart from minor visual modifications it will remain in common use until 1992. the german re-armament programs of the 1930s give birth to a slew of new uniforms representing the many different branches of the revitalized wehrmacht while the simple designs used by the reichsweir are retained in some capacity branches like the falsehood paratroopers and the waffenassas get specialized designs reflecting their status as elite units given the global nature of the second world war two men fulfilling the exact same duties might be wearing completely different uniforms depending on where they're stationed for example irwin rommel's famous africa corps wear light tan or green overalls that help them blend into desert environments and prevent men from dying of heat stroke while weighed down with heavy kit speaking of heavy kit the mg42 also strikes terror into the hearts of its enemies this year quickly becoming one of the most instantly recognizable weapons of the war both from its design and distinctive sound in contrast to those fighting in libya and egypt men stationed on the eastern front pack on as many layers as possible to avoid the terrible cold of the russian winter by now camouflage patterns are becoming more and more common especially among elite units like the ss panzer grenadiers the germans also use a huge array of weapons from the basic carabiner 98k used by most infantrymen to the mp40 machine pistol used by non-commissioned officers commissioned officers and specialists following the disaster in the east that resulted in the annihilation of army group center the german army begins fielding a new type of soldier the folks grenadier although often confused with the folk storm militia these are professional soldiers drawn from various branches of the wehrmacht were called back into service after being discharged due to injury at this late stage of the war they are often equipped with automatic weapons like the stormgiver 44 and disposable anti-tank weapons such as the panzerfaust it would also be criminal not to mention the iconic uniforms of the ss produced by the hugo boss company it is a common misconception that boss himself designed them but in fact he is only the producer the true designer of the uniform and most other ss regalia is an artist called carl device who is also a member of the organization after the defeat of germany in the second world war the country was divided between the western allies and the soviet union and was demilitarized until 1954 but after west germany joined nato they were allowed to create the bundeswehr a citizens army whose simple uniforms are designed to emphasize their duty as defenders of the new german democracy naturally these new uniforms are purposefully created to bear no resemblance to nazi iconography and even the schtalhelm is redesigned to look less like the version worn by the vermont infantry their equipment remains mostly german manufactured however with the heckler and coke g3 becoming the standard issue battle rifle in 1959. east germany also has its own military known as the nazional folks army or national people's army armed and equipped by the soviets the nva is regarded by many officers in nato as a highly effective and well-trained fighting force unlike the bundesfare the nva uniform is surprisingly similar to that of the old vermost featuring similar colors and materials even the helmet is based on a nazi prototype of the stalhelm that was not adopted during the war their arsenal also consists of an eclectic mixture of vermont and soviet firearms such as the car 98k and the mohsen the gun by the 1960's these are mostly replaced by licensed copies of the classic soviet ak usually the ak-74 or akm variants following the reunification of germany in 1990 the nva is integrated into the bundesvere and their old uniforms are discarded in favor of modern combat fatigues decorated with flectarn camouflage patterns in 1997 the venerable g3 is replaced with the much more modern g36 again made by heckler and coke the 90s also saw the complete replacement of the stalhelm with the gefex shelm m92 made out of high durability synthetic composites with modern wars increasingly taking place in desert environments the bundesbear are often seen wearing desert pattern camouflage and various accessories designed to make life easier in hot arid environments such as in afghanistan protective goggles are frequently used as are face masks and balaclavas now that our list is complete let's return to our sponsor squarespace

new puppet regime under french marshal felipe created because the germans essentially lacked both the time and energy to govern all of france by themselves the italians who had assisted hitler's conquest were also granted a small occupied zone of their own in the form of a participation award from the onset of the occupation a great shadow fell across the people of france quite literally as the germans immediately brought french clocks forward by one hour prolonging the morning darkness and hastening the arrival of night this was just the first of a host of rules and regulations imposed by the germans soon enough it was illegal to possess or conceal firearms aid escaped prisoners of war or listen to foreign propaganda basically any radio station other than those approved by the german government most impactful to the immediate aftermath of the invasion was the clause against showing hostility to the occupiers which essentially just gave them free reign to do whatever they wanted paris was rapidly swarmed by thousands of german soldiers on leave and many of its famous hotels were taken over as the headquarters of various reich military and political organizations in addition to having to deal with young and eager vermont recruits flooding the capital the armistice had fixed the exchange rate between the frank and the reichsmark at 20 to 1 making even the lowliest german private able to stock up on as much cheese and wine as he could smuggle past his commanding officers not that the officers were any better far from setting a good example the ranking members of the german army set about requisitioning vast amounts of supplies from the helpless french people baggage trains were soon leaving france on a daily basis laden with luxury items exotic foodstuffs and even priceless works of art but as much as the french people resented this inglorious plundering worse was in store nazi officials soon imposed a curfew on the nation prohibiting activity between midnight and 6am this curfew would be used like a baton to beat the populace into submission and was pushed forward multiple times in response to acts of civil disobedience however while this treatment was humiliating even more changes were on the horizon as the second world war progressed and the nazi supply situation deteriorated greater and greater material pressure was exerted on its occupied territories the flow of luxury goods out of france was soon replaced by an even greater flow of essentials such as wax metal textiles leather and a vast array of other products this led to the issuing of yet another dreaded piece of paperwork the ration card rationing in france started off strict and only got stricter as the war progressed as early as 1941 daily caloric intake by adults had fallen from 2 400 calories to between 1 200 and 1 500. by comparison german citizens in 1941 were consuming a healthy 2000 calories a day with harsh rationing came the inevitable rise of the black market where disgruntled frenchmen were happy to sell their hoarded goods to their fellow countrymen at exorbitant prices farmers faced stiff fines or imprisonment if they were caught but this was little deterrent when their goods could easily fetch 30 times the official price on the black market resulting in the creation of informal barter systems between cities and rural villages in an attempt to ease the pressure of the occupation thanks to arrangements like these the french people were able to endure the hardships of the occupation but still many citizens were now refugees displaced by the invasion and subsequent division of france with nearly 2 million french soldiers held captive many communities became ghost towns even paris was affected with its pre-war population of 3 million falling to around 800 000 by the time of the occupation many families also remained separated by a vindictive clause in the armistice which stated that germany was under no obligation to release any of the prisoners of war taken during the invasion these men were now hostages and the french people were expected to work for their release and as more able-bodied germans were drafted into the military the axis need for foreign labor grew many unconvincing propaganda posters depicting happy french laborers working in german factories had existed since the start of the occupation but when these drew little interest drastic measures were implemented in march 1942 hitler personally appointed fritz sockle to the position of general plenipotentiary for labor deployment it was soccer's job to secure foreign labor for the reich by any means necessary which would earn him the nickname the slaver of europe sakho's first initiative was conceived in cooperation with the vichy government and was called the releve or relief shift it was a simple concept for every three french workers sent to germany one french prisoner would be released this allowed fishy officials to crow in satisfaction at the great compromise they had achieved and also allowed for a new more effective propaganda strategy to promote the program working abroad in germany was now an act of utmost patriotism a selfless sacrifice to help reunite brave soldiers with their families but although the rule of a brought in around 250 000 volunteers by the end of 1942 this was still far below the quota in february of 1943 salko pressured vichy france into endorsing the compulsory work service or sto this required all healthy males between 18 and 50 and all single females between 21 and 35 to be subject to do any work the government deemed necessary no matter how the vichy government chose to spin this new scheme there was no hiding its true nature as a slave labor program the introduction of the sto was arguably the breaking point for the french people they had stoically endured starvation displacement and injustice but this was too much the french resistance which up until this point had been little more than an irritant to the nazis now saw a considerable increase in membership thanks primarily to sockles efforts many men and women fled to the countryside to escape the german military police becoming the maquis a name derived from a corsican word for a type of rough elevated terrain that dominated much of rural france this land was ideal cover for resistance activities but quickly became a battleground and rural french communities found themselves embroiled in a bloody and desperate struggle where there was no such thing as an innocent bystander as early as 1940 german policy towards partisan activity was one of collective punishment if a resistance member was identified his or her family was promptly executed and as the occupation progressed this policy was widened and eventually became one of indiscriminate retaliation especially in rural areas by 1944 france was littered with mass graves and deserted villages whose inhabitants had been massacred by the ss or gestapo more insidious than both of these were the males a paramilitary force of french collaborators who worked closely with the occupiers and the uvishi government to keep their fellow countrymen under control some police were fascists from far-right parties and had existed in france before the war but many others were drawn in by the promise of better rations and exemption from the sto even still police interrogators regularly engaged in torture to extract intel from suspected resistance fighters and the information they obtained led directly to many of the massacres committed during the occupation in the years to come however they would realize that their collaboration would not go unpunished in june of 1944 the german stranglehold over france was finally broken by the normandy landings in which the resistance played a significant role by isolating german forces in the region only a month later operation dragoon began in the south forcing a german withdrawal from the occupied territories in paris despite possessing fewer than a hundred guns at the start the resistance quickly procured an arsenal of german weapons including tanks as chaos engulfed the nation angry mobs quickly took to the streets when news of their struggle reached the allies a free french armored division rushed to the capital at which point the nazi governor promptly surrendered estimates regarding the number of frenchmen put to death for collaboration vary widely but it was probably around 10 000 individuals over the course of the war this would be followed by trials known as the legal purge ironically those who escaped vigilante justice found themselves interned in concentration camps initially built by the vichy government france had also lost most of its infrastructure as a result of the allied bombing campaigns that preceded liberation and in total some 150 000 civilians had died during the occupation of these numbers a staggering 30 000 had been directly executed by germans for various crimes against the regime and another 60 000 had fought and died with the resistance throughout the brutality and hardships of the occupation the spirit of the french people remained unbroken while a few sought to escape hardship by ingratiating themselves with their new masters most frenchmen were thoroughly united in opposition to nazi rule within a few decades france would once again be one of the leading nations in europe with a strong economy and a founding position in nato but one needs only to take a walk through the ruins of villages like aurador sergeland to

British Empire in Africa following their progress from the first small colonial outposts in the 1600s and continuing all the way to the fully fledged imperial ambitions to the 1800s we will also explore how trade and wars in Europe affected British colonialism and to their interactions with the natives the beginning of British colonisation in Africa did not start with a spectacular battle between empires but rather with meetings in the counting houses of London in 1618 English King James the first granted a monopoly on all business conducted in West Africa to the london-based Guinea Company this enterprise operated for the rest of the 17th century trading primarily in gold timber and slaves these Tyl ventures where the sole presence England had in Africa until after the American war for independence which launched the empire into a colonization fever however due to the inconvenient fact that European settlers had a tendency to die of horrible diseases if they so much as came within sight of the coastline the first British colony in Africa Sierra Leone was populated by only one thousand freed slaves with disease deterring immigration the British struggled to establish further colonies in Africa but they remained keenly aware of the potential profits a successful undertaking might bring in the end much of Britain's work had already been done for them the Dutch had established a foothold in the southernmost tip of Africa as far back as 1652 their settlement Cape Town allowed the Dutch to monopolize the lucrative spice trade in India and Asia but when revolutionary France with whom the crown was at war subjugated the Netherlands in 1795 Britain saw the perfect opportunity to annex Cape Town under the pretense of denying the French access to India two squadrons of warships were quickly dispatched to secure at a colony which was then formally integrated into the Empire in 1814 while Cape Town was the largest settlement of South Africa it did not automatically grant the British control over the region despite an initial promise to not interfere with local affairs magistrates soon began implementing new laws and regulations only written in English causing discontent among the Dutch speaking settlers who felt that their cultural identity was being deliberately suppressed British Authority was further compromised by Dutch farmers when they had migrated inland in search of greener were in this case browner pastures known later in history as the Boers these farmers were fiercely independent with many having fled religious persecution in their home country to start a new life another major point of contention between the existing settlers and their new rulers was over the issue of slavery which had been legal under the Dutch administration while hardly innocent of the practice itself the British Empire was now moving steadily in the direction of abolition when slavery was finally declared illegal in 1833 it sparked a massive exodus from Cape Town called the Great Trek with thousands of settlers leaving to found new independent republics as far from British rule as possible this great migration would only delay the inevitable however as within decades the British would again be seeking to assert their dominance over the region for now however the British sought to expand their holdings back in West Africa inevitably they came into conflict with the local powers one of these was the Asante Empire located in modern Ghana after years of simmering hostility the Asante finally provoked the British into open conflict in 1824 when they murdered an African officer serving in a local unit of the British Army in response the governor of Sierra Leone Sir Charles McCarthy led a force of about 3,000 men to crush what he saw as nothing more than a group of upstarts savages unfortunately first Sir Charles this was not to be his legacy instead he would attain and altogether less dignified place in history when he and his men were slaughtered by 10,000 Asante when they tried to cross the Prok River the Saudi King then turned to McCarthy's skull into a rather elegant gold trim two drinking cup which he would enjoy for years to come but after an unsuccessful incursion by the Asante in the Second Battle of Accra in which they were driven back by Congreve blockage systems the Asante signed a treaty with the British in 1831 establishing the prover as the natural border between their two territories the treaty would last 30 years with large-scale conflict avoided until the British again interfered with Asante trade by acquiring the Dutch Gold Coast colony prompting a native Persian the British retaliated with a 2500 man force decisively defeating the asan D and two engagements they went on to capture their capital city of Kumasi after wandering through the vast royal palace and admiring its extensive collection of books and beautiful artwork the British soldiers took great care in demolishing it with explosives hopefully somebody remembered to retrieve poor Sir Charles McCarthy skull from the palace beforehand with the Asante effectively beaten the British Empire turned its attention back southwards the sudden discovery of diamonds near the town of Kimberley led the British to aggressively expand their control over the region at expense of both the African natives and the local Boer Republic's in 1874 the British government tasked their Secretary of State for the colonies Henry Herbert with organizing the Boer settlements in South Africa into a federation this Federation they reasoned could then be governed as one state giving the British de facto control over all of the diamond mines in the region naturally the Defiant Boers were less than thrilled by this proposal Henry Herbert was therefore forced to turn his attention to the other looming obstacle to British control or for the region the Zulu known to history as one of Britain's most stalwart adversaries on the African continent the Zulu Kingdom had first risen to prominence in the early 1800s under the leadership of King Shaka and had already come into conflict with the Boers later in the century although not as acquainted with firearms as the asan D the Zulu fielded a highly disciplined army numbering in the tens of thousands but despite their formidable strength English officials such as Henry Bartow prayer attempted to provoke the Zulu into a conflict that can justify annexation in 1877 the Boer Republic of Trance fall was occupied and with their new acquisition the British an ultimatum demanding the natives to disband their entire army and accept British authority to the surprise of nobody the reigning Zulu King Cetshwayo rejected these absurd demands giving the excuse needed for an invasion two years later a force of 1800 British soldiers marched into zulu lands and were immediately sent scrambling right back out again after suffering a crushing defeat at the Battle of Eastland Wong one of Britain's worst ever colonial losses this defeat was caused by a combination of several factors but chief among them was the British overconfidence and their lack of familiarity with the local terrain this led to their columns being swiftly outmaneuvered by Zulu warriors who were able to conceal themselves until the perfect moment to strike with overwhelming force total disaster was only averted by the defense of Orcs drift were 150 British soldiers held off 4,000 native Braves in a grueling 12-hour siege but the British learned the lessons of Iceland wanna well and in just a few months a second invasion of Zulu land began this time their advance was methodical denying their enemy any chance of an ambush on July 4th 1879 Zulu warriors rallied in defense of their capital city eluding but with British cavalry screaming their flanks and both artillery and machine guns supporting their line of fire the ensuing battle was a total defeat for the natives such wire was then deposed and his vast Kingdom added to the long list of British acquisitions in Africa the next year it was the Boers turn to rise up against the empire an armed rebellion broke out in the occupied Transvaal Republic in 1880 eventually escalating into what can best be described as a guerrilla war after their losses against the Zulu the British were unwilling to commit additional troops to the region and granted the Republic independence after losing hundreds in bloody skirmishes even as an uneasy peace finally settled over South Africa events began moving along the Mediterranean coast the Ottoman tributary of Egypt had been the focus of European attention since the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869 which had justified its enormous production costs by finally providing European traders with a quick route to Asia after decades of wasteful spending by the Khedive x' or governors of egypt and a recently clumsy invasion of Ethiopia European creditors effectively owned the country sparking an anti colonial nationalist coup led by former Army officer Ahmed Urabe in 1879 seeing a golden opportunity the British declared their support for the deposed Khedive Mohammed Pasha and dispatched a large expedition to crush the revolt during the following anglo-egyptian war men aboard the British warships deliberate as long and hard about how to quell the unrest and restore order so logically they opened fire and hurt the entire city to the ground soon after British troops landed a decisive defeat to the Nationalists at the Battle of Tel el kebir with the indebted Khedive restored to power and English soldiers sitting comfortably in the Egyptian capital the British Empire held control over both the country and the Suez Canal Egypt would remain their unofficial colony until 1922 despite their territorial gains in Egypt and a monopoly over trade in Asia via the Suez Canal and Cape Town Britain's actual colonization efforts in Africa were still remarkably limited the collapse of the slave trade also removed a primary motivator for European involvement in the interior of the continent leaving most nations content to squabble over the coastal trading ports but during the 1880s the Industrial Revolution had created an explosive new demand for Africa's natural resources additionally rising population levels had created an impoverished underclass that were desperate to migrate overseas in search for a better life politics also played a role in a new surge of interest in African colonization with no more room in Europe or the Americas old rivals now began looking hungrily towards Africa as their next opportunity for expansion and dominance as tensions rose between the various colonial nations German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck stepped forward to defuse the situation at the Berlin Conference of 1884 representatives of 13 European nations and the United States agreed on a set of rules for the planned colonization of Africa no African representatives were present in just a few short years the interior of Africa referred to as the white man's grave became increasingly accessible steamships were making journeys to the southern regions less daunting and the first train tracks were already being laid medicines that could combat lethal tropical diseases such as malaria and yellow fever were also coming into common use machine guns were the last equalizing factor allowing European armies to confidently subdue natives with little fear of retaliation however machine guns could only partially compensate for the British tendency to underestimate their native enemies and they were soon embroiled in yet another major conflict this time it was with the Kingdom of Benin located in what is now modern Nigeria the kingdom was a major exporter of palm oil and rubber but refused to trade with Britain after becoming suspicious of their intentions these suspicions proved to be correct when a British official named James Robert Phillips was discovered trying to sneak a force of 250 African soldiers into the Bene capital city this disguised force was promptly slaughtered and only two officers escaped alive after this embarrassing debacle the British openly invaded with a second force of around 1200 men using the massacre of their African soldiers as justification the new army marched through Benning territory destroying every settlement they encountered resistance to the invasion was fierce but the Bene capital was captured after a 10-day siege after admiring its elaborate infrastructure of beautiful temples and massive earthen walls the British deliberated long and hard about how to ease tensions and restore order so logically they burnt the whole city to the ground and congratulated themselves on a job well done but just as it seemed like the Empire was getting a handle on the native situation in Africa news arrived that prospectors digging in the Boer republic of Trance fall had discovered a vast deposit of gold influential British politician and ruthless businessman Cecil Rhodes quickly became obsessed with controlling this trade but the British government was wary of another direct conflict with the boards thus roads used his position as founder of the British South Africa company to embark on a campaign of deliberate provocation this led to the second world war in 1899 during which the company targeted the Boers with brutal acts of repression that left whole communities destroyed and thousands carted off to the first concentration camps in history in these camps the Boers were deliberately neglected and at least 46,000 died of starvation or disease of these deaths about 20,000 we're natives caught up in the conflict but the remaining 26,000 were Boer women and children after nearly three years of bush fighting the beleaguered remnants of the Boer Republic's finally capitulated and allowed themselves to be unified into a semi-autonomous Dominion known as the Union of South Africa in addition to subdue the Boers Cecil Rhodes was also primarily responsible for the British push south of Egypt into Sudan where they acquired many other territories in an effort to out-compete French and German interests in the region this southern expansion quickly sparked conflict with the modest Sudanese who had United in a jihad against foreign interference and were led by a charismatic Muslim preacher called Muhammad Ahmad the resulting modest war would eventually expand to include multiple European powers and only ended after nine years of brutal desert warfare this was the war that saw the death of governor-general Charles Gordon one of the most senior British officials to be killed in Africa by hostile action with the native subdued and the Scramble for Africa starting to wind down the British began refocusing their efforts from expansion to consolidation in 1904 they signed to the ant ant cordial with France ending decades of animosity and finally enabling both nations to turn their full attention on the German Empire the South African colonies would have immense strategic value in any future European conflict because of their position on one of the only two viable routes to the Indian Ocean wary of future uprisings by their African subjects the British adopted a policy of appeasement towards the white African or minorities granting them additional powers and privileges under the colonial administration this policy naturally resulted in a normalization of various overt and racist ideologies and would directly lead to the foundation of apartheid in the 1940s eventually the Union of South Africa would steadily drift away from the Empire as it entered its twilight years finally severing all ties in 1961 the remnants of the British legacy in Africa include colonial architecture and extensive infrastructure projects that remain functional to this day however those foundations rest on centuries of genocide discrimination and exploitation most of which were deliberately enforced to destabilize native cultures in order to pave way for colonial rule but today the continent is rebuilding with many nations undergoing some of the highest rates of economic development in the world in some cases even surpassing the growth rates of their former occupiers if you would like to see more videos on colonial or

       " \" on a sweltering July morning in 1944 a squad of US Army infantryman marches into an abandoned French town although their squad leader is vigilant his senses are more used to the cramped alleyways of inner-city Boston than the rural French architecture that now surrounds him and his squad as he gazes down the street he hesitates momentarily raising his fists to a halt something is wrong is it the lack of birdsong perhaps there was a footstep nearby or was it just the wind whistling through the empty streets he tenses up certain that something is out of the ordinary but he is

be different from our usual format rather than recounting an event we're giving a perspective today we'll be examining this question in 1944 between the United States and Germany who had the superior regular infantry squad using modern day insight can one gather enough evidence to get a definitive answer maybe not in a single YouTube video however we can look at the facts and at least try to get a basic idea of who had the edge and of course this is ultimately just our opinion and the events depicted are entirely fictional so then how did we make our judgment our team researched the tactics mentality training and weapons of both armies as they were in mid-1944 and we have used this information to develop a program which simulates thousands of squad level engagements our simulations ignore outside variables like supplies and support from other branches in order to give each 10 to 12 man squad a level playing field to test their abilities in this video we will choose three random simulations to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages which each side had the third and final simulation will reveal which squad ultimately won more American squad is still pinned down from the German machine gunner but all is not lost thinking quickly the American assistant squad leader a burly Texan known for his quick temper Prime's a grenade from his belt and flings it out into the street the sudden violent explosion sends up a plume of smoke and dust and with a harsh bellow the Texan rallies his men for a counter-attack while the German NCO yells for his stunned gunner to resume firing the Americans plunge through the concealing haze created by the grenade and enter close combat brandishing bayonets on their m1 garand attention recruits we here in the US military take

internal magazine downrange as fast as you can pull the trigger load it with a powerful 30-odd 6 Springfield cartridge m1 lets each soldier knock out its target up to 450 meters away as they charge several riflemen throw more grenades while the VAR operator closes down the building concealing the German machine gunner suppressing him at a crucial moment flushed from their cover by the explosions several German riflemen are quickly shot dead but others retain the presence of mind to return fire in the ensuing chaos the German NCO rallies the machine-gun crew and the Americans are caught in the crossfire when the smoke clears the American squad will have been reduced to only a few injured survivors but their coordination and bravery in the face of the ambush have cost the Germans several casualties as well a good effort from the Americans but what went wrong first the Americans left themselves vulnerable to an ambush and as a result they lost their noncommissioned officer but their extensive training allowed them to regroup effectively without a leader in the face of the overwhelming firepower of the mg42 but despite the heroic Texan sergeants best efforts the heavily experienced group inferior or squad leader maintained his fire superiority and overwhelmed the Americans now let's speed up the simulation a bit and analyze another engagement a sudden shout of alarm makes the American squad instinctively dive for cover saving the lives of a half-dozen men as the mg42 opens fire the German squad leader swears at his Swabian dialect as the enemy takes cover and then orders the gunner to fire in bursts not wanting his machine gun this centerpiece of the German squad to overheat at a critical moment the Americans begin exchanging rounds with their opponents their m1 garand and the VA are issuing a retort to the mg42 and the car 98ks what could be better than the m1 garand how about a genuine made in America magazines that m1918 browning automatic rifle this lovely chatterbox is there to support you and your brothers on the panel field sorry kraut our boys won't be visiting GI Jesus today and remember private with only 20 rounds per magazine you'd better master the fine art of trigger discipline while the Germans are engaged the American squad leader issues a series of quick orders splitting his 12 man squad into three smaller groups choosing to direct from the rear he stays with his machine gunner grenadiers and two riflemen leaning out of cover to spray his Thompson submachine gun down the street meanwhile the assistant squad leader leads the two other elements on a flanking maneuver then a nervous rifleman stumbles over a loose cobblestone because of his inexperience he has forgotten to take his finger off the trigger of his weapon and it accidentally discharges startling the Germans and drawing their attention to the right flank unsure what to do several German riflemen continue supporting the mg42 but others realize the danger and turn to fire on the seven Americans caught in the open only the Bavarian squad leader realizes that they are in danger of being flanked so he turns his mp40 on the enemy [Music] they sang

it perfected and comforting abandoned Elena guide net profit Medina deflation fire hotter from fill furniture for me notice divine air for on the fire on the dragonfly tone in private file da cunha rotating the American Grenadier fires a smoke grenade in a high arc in front of the German position slightly adjusting his aim he fires a frag grenade a few feet beyond the smoke though he is unaware he has just killed the German squad leader with the thick phosphorus smoke obscuring their position the Americans on the left advanced quickly one is cut down by a wild verse from the mg42 but within moments they have closed the gap the fight is short and brutal with the Americans in the center joining in as soon as the mg42 is silenced without a leader and surrounded by a ring of American steel the remaining Germans are all too eager to surrender in this engagement we got to see the Americans showcasing their signature tactic fire and move while one group exposes themselves to advance the rest of the squad draws and suppresses enemy fire from behind cover the German tactics emphasized supporting the mg42 and concentrating the entire squads firepower on a single target but the Americans spread themselves too thin for the Germans to have any clear targets a perfect counter to this tactic now let's skip ahead to the final battle of the simulation and find out which infantry was truly superior in a cool steady downpour a German squad marches briskly through the fog as they pass a partially demolished church their leader calls for them to regroup and catch their breath before anyone can open their canteen though the crack of an m1 garand plates the stillness as the American squad launches into an ambush the Germans quickly retreat behind the rubble of the church and as the American infantrymen break cover the Germans are quickly cornered their squad leader orders his machine gunner to the top of the cracked bell tower while his rifle and steadily hoard bullets down the cratered stream he frantically spray is his mp40 downrange but the Americans continue to gain ground finally the mg42 erupts to life from above as the German buzzsaw suppresses his rifleman the American Staff Sergeant sees two of them cut down before his eyes understanding the severity of the situation he throws away his cigarette orders his squad to take cover and they duck into the alleyways behind abandoned vehicles as he assesses the situation seeing an opportunity to separate the overextended Americans the German squad leader pushes out of the church his squad focuses its fire on an overturned truck his men scattered by the enemy machine-gun the American Staff Sergeant gives new orders to a rifleman and a Grenadier after they disappeared down an alleyway he shouts at the rest of his squad to focus all of their fire on the mg42 you know what an arm's suck in the Mafia and the US Army sergeant has in common besides bravado both wield an m1a1 variant good old Chicago typewriter commonly referred to as the Tommy gun this weapon dispenses justice to America's enemies blistering 700 rounds per minute we tucked away that clumsy drum magazine and now it takes between 10 and 30 rounds stick magazines stay close to Sarge and see the Jerry turn and run as the mg42 buzzes over their heads and cuts through the rain the two detached Americans emerge from behind the church after shaking the water out of the chambers of their rifles they load fresh clips and sneak through a wooden door in the back of the sanctuary just before they make it to the stairs however the German squad leaders spots them and orders three of his men to give chase as they climb up the stairs in pursue a shot rings out and the lead German falls backwards nearly knocking the other two down but not before they returned fire at the Grenadier who leans back into cover knowing that the Germans have to manually cycle their rifles between each shot the Grenadier immediately reappears and takes both of them out before they even have a chance to react back outside their squad is in a desperate situation the second-in-command has sustained a head wound the VAR gunner has been shot in the stomach and the squad leaders matches are wet which makes the predicament all more severe suddenly there's a commotion from the bell tower screaming in German followed by the explosion of a hand grenade flakes of plasters splash onto the street as the entire tower begins to lean panicking the Germans flee from the battlefield as it crashes onto their form the staff sergeant picks himself up and while checking his pockets for spare matchbox orders his remaining men to tend to the wounded this concludes our simulation the Americans winning this fight represents our belief that the late war United States infantry squad was marginally superior to the German equivalent the average US soldier received more training their cohesion was better their tactics more adaptable and their semi-automatic rifles gave them a distinct advantage the German squad based its tactics around the mg42 a machine gun which outclassed the American var in many respects but this created an easily exploited weakness if the mg42 was taken out results from our simulations show the United States winning 54% of the time and Germany winning 46% of the time this narrow margin of victory for the Americans goes to show how closely matched these two forces truly were as we saw the Americans failed to successfully ambush the Germans and with the mg42 deployed high up in the bell tower the Americans were almost completely immobilized but in the close quarters of the church we saw just how much an advantage the semi-automatic m1 garand had over the bolt-action kar98k when the grenadiers neutralized three German riflemen this video is the first in a new series on this channel comparing different armies throughout history and we plan to use this program to simulate many more matchups

worst inflation in history to somehow conquering europe all within the span of just 20 years while the german national socialist party appeared to have brought the economy back on track we'll also examine how in many ways it didn't but first we need to establish just what crippled the german economy and that requires going further back to the ashes of the great war when all hope seemed lost shortly after the german surrender on the 11th of november 1918 a socialist uprising forced kaiser wilhelm ii to abdicate without designating an heir in the wake of this upheaval the german monarchy was dismantled and a new government popularly referred to as the weimar republic rose to take its place this new government was forced to sign the humiliating treaty of versailles in june 1919. in addition to being forced to pay crippling war reparations the industrial heartland of the nation was occupied and the german military was all but dismantled public perception of the new republic quickly became overwhelmingly negative with many patriotic germans blaming the revolution for their capitulation during the great war a national myth that would have devastating consequences further down the line with virtually no industry and a population hostile to taxation the weimar republic resorted to a solution dear to the hearts of economists everywhere printing money to satisfy its debtors inevitably this resulted in hyper inflation and the german mark plummeted in value at its lowest point in late 1923 a little over 4 trillion german marks was equivalent to a single us dollar in the end a desperate germany appealed to the british and americans for assistance resulting in the enactment of the dawes plan this plan introduced a new currency based on the gold standard called the renton mark and the loaned germany a massive amount of money to restart its industrial sector under the dawes plan the weimar republic enjoyed a few years of relative stability and recovery but in 1929 the great depression struck and funding from the united states evaporated almost overnight worse still germany's creditors began rushing for repayments plunging the country straight back into financial ruin while a series of german chancellors like franz von poppin and general kurt van slicher were busy handling the fallout a new political faction began to emerge the national socialist german workers party or simply the nazi party founded in 1920 they preyed on middle-class fears of a communist uprising for support and promoted an extremely antagonistic anti-semitic platform that demanded a racially pure germany despite surging in elections and soon becoming the most popular party the national socialists lost 2 million votes in the reichstag elections in 1932 seeking to capitalize on this weakness the conservative establishment within the republic thought the time was now ripe to pacify this violent party by welcoming some of its leaders into power surrounded by conservative ministers and only having a handful of allies in cabinet positions nazi leader adolf hitler was appointed reich chancellor by president paul von hinnenberg in january 1933 the conservative establishment thought they could control him for their own ends but they couldn't have been more wrong suffice to say hitler and his movement could not be contained the methods by which hitler went from being essentially a lone chancellor surrounded by his opposition to having complete control of the government could warrant its own video but soon enough the weimar republic was no more and the national socialist party was in full control [Applause] using a new secret police force the nazis built a system of violent oppression and surveillance attempting to silence descent and unify the country towards one goal war with the outward display of public support the nazis first decided to tackle the unemployment problem in reality the next decade would merely see the expansion of the german military under the manipulative guise of repairing the economy in some instances instead of creating jobs they simply distorted the numbers by encouraging young couples to get married through generous marriage loans which removed women from the workforce this reduced the pool of economically active people thus creating the illusion of a falsely esteemed workforce other shady tactics including counting part-time workers as fully employed or even classifying forced laborers and prisoners as full-time employees additionally in accordance with nazi racial policy many jews were forced out of their jobs or had their businesses confiscated and redistributed to non-jewish businessmen who displayed loyalty to the party this falsifiable image of economic recovery opened up new opportunities for non-jewish germans but at the same time caused enormous suffering and hardship for those deemed undesirable this isn't to say that there weren't job creation programs the nazis invested hundreds of millions of marks into various games to get the germans back to work and millions of germans were now able to find full-time jobs in hitler's new arms factories but other job creation programs were far less traditional co-opting an existing labor program called the voluntary labor service the nazis forced the unemployed or people receiving welfare benefits to volunteer for hard labor like farming or clearing earth for the state's massive construction projects hundreds of thousands of germans were forced to toil in abysmal conditions for lower pay than they were even receiving under the welfare program and any who expressed complaints were sent to early forms of the concentration camps and yet to the nazis these suffering workers represented an encouraging statistic by 1935 unemployment rates had plummeted to only 2 million people but if you include the unemployment rate the forced laborers prisoners and women taken out of the workforce by marriage loans the actual unemployment rate stood at about double this figure however rotten its foundation may have been the german economy was growing but it was not nearly enough to cover the amount the government was spending rather than temper their ambitions the nazis engaged in massive deficit spending to finance the programs they had in mind german economists instituted a complicated new credit system called mifo bills that allowed them to create and spend enormous amounts of cash while avoiding a new round of hyperinflation these mipho bills essentially acted like government bonds and allowed the nazis to spend money that didn't really exist this initially proved successful but gradually collapsed over time the german government was spending exorbitant amounts of money on rearmament and public works projects with the mindset that it would all be repaid by the plunder and land seizure of future conquests they instituted no long-term economic plan and made no attempts to boost foreign trade or look beyond the coming war as the national debt skyrocketed the nazis didn't stop to consider what would happen if they lost the war they had been banking on instead they invested everything they had into ensuring they would win every subsidy and every investment made went into manufacturing and engineering at the almost complete abandonment of consumer goods all of the nazis programs and initiatives from job creation to public works to even their racial policies were ultimately meant to serve the cause of rearmament perhaps one of the most famous public works launched during this time the audubon highway system was no different financed in part by laws that granted a billion marks for infrastructure projects the autobahn was marketed as a massive modern highway system for the new german citizen to proudly tour his country behind the wheel of a shiny new car unsurprisingly it also had another purpose hitler envisioned the highways of the audubon as the main arteries of a new military mobilization system he pictured columns upon columns of panzers rolling down the roads protected by a thick concrete shell that towered over the highways and blocked air attacks contrary to his lofty vision no concrete tunnels were ever built and the roads proved too unstable for heavy tanks to roll along even the system under which the highways were laid out prevented them from having any use in military mobilization since the roads were too far away from any front line despite creating over 100 000 jobs and improving infrastructure the audubon's true success was propagandistic hitler personally planned some routes to weave through the most picturesque views in germany and insisted on the most modern bridge and road designs to project the image of a unified and idealistic state but the government encountered a bump in the autobahn the average citizen couldn't afford a car so who is going to use the new highway system in the first place as a solution hitler imagined an affordable and cheaply produced vehicle known as the people's car or volkswagen that everyday citizens could purchase and drive through the new scenic highways through the beautiful german countryside a mass advertising campaign and workers payment program were launched to promote the car and hundreds of thousands of laborers enthusiastically signed on but as with so much during this period everything ended up being used in service of the ultimate goal instead re-armament despite 340 000 workers investing 110 million reichsmarks into the car payment program not one would actually receive a car all of the funds collected by the people's car campaign went straight towards war spending car ownership in germany did noticeably increase during this period but the autobahn was not merely the success portrayed by nazi propaganda even by 1939 railways remained the most common form of transport in the country these years of spending on military rearmaments did not go unnoticed as germany was not yet ready for war hitler had to fabricate a variety of excuses to justify the expansion of the armed forces to foreign powers to the surprise of many germany was suddenly very interested in producing thousands upon thousands of innocent passenger planes and agricultural tractors these vehicles only existed on paper however there was nothing innocent nor agricultural about the messerschmitts and panzers rolling off the assembly lines or the rifles and howitzers emerging under the table from civilian manufacturers across the country this disguised military buildup culminated in 1935 when mandatory conscription was passed and by the end of the year the army had grown to nearly eight hundred thousand men over eight times the maximum set by the treaty of versailles with this act the last of germany's non-jewish unemployed men were swept into military service and unemployment was on paper at least fully eradicated the result of all of this was that germany entered the second world war far better off than it had been at the end of the last great war the gross national product had surged to well over 100 billion reichsmarks in 1939 from a low of 60 billion in 1932 and to all it seemed that germany had fully regained its strength but while unemployment was down and manufacturing and capital were up many of those so-called employed germans were slaving away in a labor camp and that capital was contingent on the complete success of the war further the benefits from all of this economic success were skewed heavily towards those considered true germans and came at the expense of everyone else like the autobahn unable to carry hitler's tanks the nazi economy was shiny on the surface but hollow at its core [Music] [Music]

griffin Johnson the armchair historian today we begin the first part of our documentary on the Western Front from the summer of 1944 on the beaches of Normandy to the spring of 1945 in the heart of Germany part two of this video is also available right now so don't forget to open up a new tab so you can pick up the story right where we leave it off today with all that said let's drop in by May of 1944 allied supremacy in the Mediterranean feeder remained frustratingly elusive hopes had been high after the successful campaigns in North Africa and Sicily but were quickly dashed during the invasion of mainland Italy which had been intended to open an easy route straight to Germany's doorstep although initially termed the soft underbelly of Europe by Winston Churchill progress had come to an abrupt halt at the heavily fortified Gustav line and Hitler's veteran troops were showing no signs of her treat or surrender frustrated by this lack of ress allied planners had finally gotten the green light to open their second front after years of careful deliberation the invasion of Normandy codenamed Overlord was finally commencing the allied units involved in the operation consisted of the American 1st Army and the British Second Army under the overall command of Dwight D Eisenhower each army was assigned to one or more of the five Normandy landing sites codenamed Utah Omaha gold sword and Juno over 140,000 men would be involved in the initial attack which was set to hit all beaches simultaneously in the early hours of June 5th however due to poor weather conditions the invasion was launched on June 6 the Commonwealth forces landing at gold Juno and sword beaches were tasked with capturing calm an important rail and road hub as well as the nearby copycat airfield further west the American forces would be faced with a bloody struggle for the possession of beaches Omaha and Utah their objective was to isolate the acutal ton of Peninsula which contained the vital port city of Cherbourg facing every landing army were the formidable defenses of the Atlantic Wall which had thus far proved almost immune to Allied air raids and was manned by roughly 50,000 German soldiers although a naval bombardment two hours prior to the landings had managed to crack open a few of the German bunkers a number of heavy guns remained intact and opened fire on the approaching landing craft the men aboard the landing craft could only grit their teeth as 88-millimeter shells splashed around them the Allies had equipped a number of tanks with canvas skirts so they could be dropped in shallow waters ahead of the infantry but the six foot waves rendered these modifications almost useless their transports ended up having to dash for the shore and dump precious cargo directly onto the sand with several sunk by enemy fire and underwater obstacles in the process despite all these setbacks British soldiers rushed the entrenched German positions equipped with nothing but their small arms even though mg 42s shredded whole platoons as they disembarked the Germans were unable to repel the armored vehicles that had started to make it ashore it was one of these vehicles that finally silenced the deadly 88 millimeter gun that had been firing all morning between the two British sites was Juno Beach where the Canadians would have a chance to prove they were more than just America's plight neighbor shallow reefs and minefields made landing difficult and the nearby coastal villages were heavily fortified however while sustaining heavy casualties the brave men of the Canadian 3rd Infantry Division broke through the German defenses and secured Juno by mid-afternoon having achieved to their initial objective the third division linked up with British forces from Gold Beach and pushed inland further fracturing the disorganized German line US forces meanwhile or not having as much love from the very moment their landings began at 6:30 things started to go wrong the amphibious tanks that were sent along with the first wave of infantry could not handle the heavy seas and only two out of 29 even made it to the beaches a lack of heavy armament meant the infantry could not easily advance and many were slaughtered as they attempted to cross the barren stretch of sand between the shore and the enemy bunkers Omaha Beach was the largest to be stormed on d-day and the poor weather conditions meant that men often waded ashore only to find themselves in the completely wrong landing zone with nowhere to hide these confused soldiers were forced to form ad hoc units and simply press forwards toward the nearest source of enemy fire their greater objectives forgotten in the chaos of the moment looming over of the American landing zones was La Puente du Hoc a 100 foot or 30 meter tall promontory that housed a network of German bunkers and as many as six massive 155-millimeter case mated guns while men crawled through the sand below soldiers of the 2nd and 5th Army Ranger battalions conducted a valiant assault on the enemy stronghold the first Rangers reached the cliffs at 7:10 a.m. and began to scale them using the remaining ladders and craft no launchers the resistance was fierce but the Rangers persevered systematically clearing the bunkers until they reached the huge casemates where the 155 millimeter guns were located only then did they discover the futility of their operation both guns were missing removed days earlier after they proved to be a magnet for Allied bombing runs in total the 225 man assault force left nearly half of their number lying dead or wounded their heavy casualties as much the fault of Allied intelligence as anything else at 8:30 a.m. the first German counter-attack struck Omaha now the most heavily contested of the five landing zones several more would follow throughout the day with the most successful occurring around 4:00 p.m. when the 21st Panzer Division the only armored unit in the range of the coast line at the time rocketed through the vulnerable corridor between Juno and sword this was without any exaggeration the worst-case scenario no matter how many troops the Allies had landed they still lacked the firepower to deal with this new threat unfortunately for the Germans this counter attack would be foiled by various factors which the Allies had been manipulating in anticipation of d-day before we continue to the action pull back a bit and explore a few of these roses in April 1944 Allied planes began an intense bombing campaign against German positions in France with the Luftwaffe occupied in the East allied aircraft outnumbered their axis counterparts by more than thirty to one Allied aviators successfully damaged coastal artillery emplacements and airfields as well as rail bridge and road networks frequently used by the ver moshed however the Allied bombing campaign was as much about misdirection as it was about destruction operation fortitude was designed to convince the Germans that the Allies would land in northeastern France as part of the even larger operation bodyguard fortitude involved false diplomatic communications false news stories and a manipulation of known double agents the Allies even constructed an entire decoy army near Dover known as the first United States Army Group this fictional formation was led by none other than General George I slapped the PTSD out of my soldiers Patton as a result the axis wasted valuable time and resources fortifying positions near the pod Calais and even as far away as the coast of Norway men of the 21st Panzers found themselves standing alone and unsupported as the singular Armored Division available during d-day German Field Marshal Ivan Rommel had foreseen this possibility and had argued that all 10 Panzer divisions in France be stationed as close to the coastline as possible ultimately the divisions were split up all over France but deception alone wasn't enough for the Allies troops needed to be inserted behind enemy lines just prior to the landings in order to further disrupt the German response the only way to do this was via air drops despite the risk one British and two American airborne were scheduled to drop on the morning of the invasion as they approached their drop zones the c-47 Dakota transport planes of the American hundred and first and 82nd Airborne Division's found themselves subject to unexpectedly heavy anti-aircraft fire thanks to this flak many paratroopers ended up scattered across Normandy however enough men landed in their intended zones to prevent the arrival of German reinforcements british paratroopers were responsible for capturing two heavily defended bridges which they held against repeated attacks from German tanks and artillery one location was later renamed Pegasus bridge after the shoulder emblem of the british paratroopers who captured it and held it during d-day members of the hundred 1st and 82nd divisions also destroyed or captured several other bridges in the Normandy area further delaying the German response as d-day drew to its bloody close thousands of Allied soldiers lay dead with precious little to show for their sacrifices although they had pushed several miles inland only gold and Juno beaches had linked up successfully the other beaches especially Omaha were still very exposed optimistic allied planners had assumed that by now several towns would be under siege and the Cotentin Peninsula would be on the verge of isolation the reality was that the Allies had failed to achieve any of these objectives and could not hope to hold the beaches against a determined assault the counter-attack by the 21st Panzer Division had been particularly devastating as it prevented forces from sword Juno beaches from linking up boarding the Allied thrust towards halt but as we mentioned before several factors foiled this assault the primary one being Allied air superiority which annihilate German armored columns forcing them back from the beaches after a week spent surrounding up men and materiel British forces attempted an armored assault on the small town of villers-bocage but were driven back to make matters worse resupply efforts were hampered by storms that prevented the deployment of artificial harbors two weeks later British reinforcements launched Operation Epsom with the aim of finally capturing calm which was now being defended by a full eighth Panzer divisions including two battalions of deadly tiger tanks thanks to this massive concentration of German armor the British were repulsed on June 30th after achieving only modest gains these repeated failures caused tension at allied headquarters especially surrounding Bernard Montgomery who conceived of Epsom this wouldn't be his last blunder on the Western Front at this point the Germans were also suffering from their own supply shortages with the war in the East taking priority above all else many of the 60 or so divisions of Army Group B stationed in northern France were severely under strength and lacked heavy equipment any attempts to mask the Panzers into a decisive force were foiled by Allied bombardment and sabotage by the French Resistance meant that German communications were unreliable at best the Americans in particular benefited from this situation and spent the rest of the month besieging the port city of Cherbourg capturing it on June 29th unfortunately the German garrison had sabotaged the port and filled the harbour with mines rendering it unusable until late August meaning that the Allies still didn't have a functioning port to bring in adequate reinforcements and supplies over in the east the Canadians finally captured the copy-cat airfield on July 9th however the British were unable to capitalize on this success and spent most of July banging their heads again the defenses of calm to no avail while progress was slow on the eastern side of Normandy over in the West the Americans began to work their way west taking the solo heights just a day after the desert foxes unlucky brush with a fighter plane though the combat was brutal the Americans ultimately prevailed and their success set the stage for the final breakout from Normandy Operation Cobra on July 25th Allied air support began performing danger-close missions against four to five German positions outside Cherbourg although highly controversial the results spoke for themselves and the German left flank swiftly began to withdraw the ensuing Allied advance was slow due to the American forces having to push through fields sewed with a bountiful crop of German land mines just waiting for the tread of an allied Phu by this point in the invasion hedgerow warfare was becoming a fact of life Normandy was covered by thick dense hedges that served mostly to divide up sections of farmland often over five metres or 16 feet tall they provided excellent cover for German infantry disrupting lines of fire and turning simple fields into miniature fortresses that had to be clean one by one at great cost to the attackers but despite the nightmare that was the French countryside the Americans pushed south and reached of Walsh by July 30th with Allied forces moving into Brittany the Germans still defending call were in danger of encirclement but before they could retreat the infamous July plot occurred this plot was an attempt by several top ranking German officers to assassinate Hitler and sue for peace with the Allies Alvin Rommel had supposedly sympathized with some of the plotters and his involvement was revealed when it collapsed on July 20th as a result he was forced to take his own life deeply mistrustful of his remaining generals Hitler took charge of the situation in Normandy himself and demanded an immediate counter-attack by this time the American spearhead was being led by the newly arrived Third Army George Patton now in charge of real soldiers captured Brittany in the first week of August at this time the Germans were busy putting together a heavy assault force consisting of two regular and two SS Panzer divisions these were intended to cut a swath through u.s. forces behind the spearhead splitting up the leading elements and allowing the Third Reich to achieve a good old-fashioned encirclement have the ver moshed successfully hidden this force they might have actually pulled it off but few access plans stayed secret in 1944 when the Panzers attacked on August 7th they were met with a devastating ambush by allied anti-tank units seizing the opportunity to meet up with patins forces Montgomery's forces in Normandy began a new offensive to the west of calm in just a few short days the tables had turned and the forces initially meant to encircle the Allies now found themselves the victim of an identical maneuver despite his best efforts to throw the Allies back into the channel Hitler slowly began to accept the situation in France and finally approved of a retreat as the Allied forces converged it became clear that the only chance for the survival of the two German armies in Normandy was an escape through fillets held by a single polish armoured division outnumbered the Polish fought valiantly and although they failed to stop the full German retreat they successfully contained nearly 50,000 German prisoners and forced the Germans to abandon most of their heavy equipment this was a decisive moment there was no longer any question of Allied superiority in northern France Normandy had fallen and the road to Paris lay open but before we discuss Paris let's not let Operation Overlord completely overshadow another massive battle that was brewing on the Western Front the invasion of southern France also known as operation Dragoon this had originally been meant to coincide with Overlord and both were topics of discussion during the Teheran conference of 1943 attended by all three Allied leaders Churchill Stalin and Roosevelt Stalin had been enthusiastic about these plans while Churchill fervently believed that allied resources would be put to better use invading the Balkans to link up with Soviet forces and prevent a communist monopoly in Eastern Europe ultimately the discussion was settled when Franklin D Roosevelt agreed with Stalin that the time had come for a cross-channel Operation Overlord was subsequently Greenland but dragoon would be shelved for the time being due to logistical concerns however the plan was revisited after storms destroyed the artificial harbor at Omaha Beach which combined with the sabotage of share Bowl created a mass backlog in allied shipping as a result the capture of such ports as Marseilles and too long suddenly became the clearest solution to the logistical crisis in the north although Churchill remained vehemently opposed to the idea General Charles de Gaulle threw his support behind it this operation would require a large scale and fibia CIN vision involving over a half a million men and would later be reinforced by the Free French by contrast German forces occupying southern France consisted of just 11 divisions under Army Group G the three beaches chosen for the initial landings were designated Alpha Delta and camel before the invasion began the southern branch of the French Resistance began a large-scale campaign of sabotage and guerrilla warfare unlike the scattered opposition it had been during the early stages of the occupation the resistance in 1944 was now operating as a paramilitary force officially recognized as the French forces of the Interior or FFI with the help from Allied commandos an SFI blew up bridges cut power lines jammed communications and attacked isolated German units three French commanders were also tasked with silencing the artillery perched atop the daunting 107 meter or 350 foot high cliffs on the mainland known as operation Romeo this raid involved 800 men the attack was a major success with the commandos killing or capturing about a thousand enemy soldiers while sustaining only a few dozen casualties themselves this was all merely a prelude to the landings themselves which took place on August 15th [Music] German soldiers were jolted from their bunks by the sudden scream of air-raid sirens as they scrambled for their gear the first bombs began to drop shaking the ground and shattering their hardened concrete bunkers there was no escape thousands of bombers clogged the skies their pilots relishing in the near-complete air superiority possessed by the Allies a full-scale naval bombardment followed with artillery shells up to 14 inches in diameter raining down on the stunt Germans although the barrage eased as the transports neared their landing zones few defenders were willing to take advantage of the reprieve alpha and Delta beaches fell with minimal resistance but Camel Beach held out stubbornly it was the most heavily defended Beach and throughout repeated shelling and bombing one section remained defiant successfully resisting Allied landings until it could be flanked by troops from other zones many hard lessons had been learned after the 10,000 casualties on d-day and ultimately the Allies would pay a toll of only 700 dead or wounded for their passage across the Mediterranean despite this initial success the invasion had only just begun on the morning after the landings for German battalions staged a two-pronged counter-attack although there was fierce fighting the offensive was doomed by low morale bad communication and a chronic shortage of heavy equipment the scattered remnants of the German forces were eventually forced to retreat leaving the Allies free to pore assure German commanders now accepted that their positions were unsalvageable after consultation with the Fuhrer a withdraw order was given for Army Group G but all defensible locations within French territory were to remain manned and resist as long as possible this uncharacteristic retreat caught the Allies by surprise in response the ad-hoc taskforce Butler was thrown together and doggedly pursued Army Group G hundreds of miles inland in an ironic twist of fate Allied armor now sped ahead of the main advance just as the Panzers had during the invasion of France less than five years prior back in the north a similar event was taking place as German Field Marshal vulture Mordo orchestrated the withdrawal of Army Group B modal had already proved himself a skilled defensive strategist on the Eastern Front and his rearguard actions in France would enable some 240,000 soldiers to escape into Belgium thanks to this most of Army Group G withdrew in good order resuming in southern France the Allies continued to advance and beseech the few fortified pockets of access resistance left in the region on August 18th they surrounded the headquarters of the German 62nd fort after days of constant harassment by the French forces of the interior the exhausted German soldiers surrendered but not before a single breakout attempt meanwhile French forces assaulted Marseille and Toulon held by just two German divisions as the French were besieging the cities in the south the Allied forces in the north were faced with the dilemma Paris was just over the horizon but it was still held by a German garrison as Allied forces inched their way towards the city if French people rose up in a large-scale uprising on at first german military governor dietrich von choltitz attempted to quell the unrest and keep the city open for resisting german forces nope he accomplished the former it was clear that his time was up when the Free French 2nd Armored Division arrived 5 days later Hitler then ordered poll tips to raise the city instead he surrendered it to the Allies soon after General Charles de Gaulle led a massive three-day long parade throughout the city the provisional government of France was finally back on home soil and French military affairs would now be run directly from the capital within another month almost all of France would be liberated with German resistance contained to just a few tiny pockets along the coastline however the German Reich was far from capitulation fueled marshal modal's efforts had paid off and hundreds of thousands of battle-hardened German troops now patiently awaited the next major advance at the Aziz freed line this vast defensive work would be the equal of the Atlantic Wall with some sections resisting the Allies right up to the collapse of the Nazi regime in 1945 thus far we've covered both Operation Overlord and operation Dragoon and followed the liberation of France all the way up to the fall of Paris we've seen how the Allies have dealt with the obstacle of the

posthumous Medal of Honor [Music] the sacrifice of John a chamond was just one more name added to the list of men who died in the pursuit of justice over September 11th a date forever seared into the American consciousness on that infamous day four planes were seized by members of al Qaeda while one was diverted from its target by the heroic efforts of its passengers the other three would go on to strike the Pentagon and the World Trade Center inflicting nearly 3,000 casualties in the worst terror attack to ever occur on US soil but even as rescue teams began picking through the rubble a cry for vengeance went out resounding across the wounded nation no matter who was responsible this attack would not go unanswered from the start US intelligence operatives had one chief suspect in mind Osama bin Laden head of al Qaeda and former member of one of the wealthiest families in Saudi Arabia bin Laden was already a suspect in the bombings of two US embassies in East Africa an to the Clinton administration had made several efforts to apprehend or assassinate him in 1998 and 1999 unfortunately then Laden was a wily opponent seemingly capable of escaping from any trap but with the international spotlight now firmly on al Qaeda's activities after the 9/11 attacks pressure began to mount on their primary supporters in the Middle East the Taliban while the US was still mourning its dead president george w bush issued a stirring ultimatum to the taliban who were the de facto rulers of afghanistan his message was clear and succinct expel al qaeda and turn over bin laden or we will smash your illegal regime to pieces and dig him out of the rubble ourselves the Taliban stubbornly refused and so the stage was set for yet another bloody conflict in the Middle East but before we discussed the 2001 invasion let's take a few minutes to establish some contacts historically speaking Afghanistan has been one of the most tumultuous and unstable regions on earth isolated from its neighbours by the tall peaks of the Hindu Kush it remained a land of nomadic cattle farmers and tribal fiefdom well into the 20th century any real developments in modern infrastructure were rudely interrupted by the 1978 communist revolution which led to a Soviet invasion one year later as the new frontline of the ongoing cold war Afghanistan received immediate attention from a plethora of state actors including the United States Saudi Arabia and most importantly Pakistan ever since it gained independence in 1947 Pakistan has had good reason to meddle in Afghanistan's affairs much as Germany in the 19th century devoted its diplomatic efforts to prevent an alliance between France and Russia Pakistan has invested huge amounts of time and resources into preventing Afghanistan from establishing ties with India such a union would isolate Pakistan leaving it vulnerable economically and militarily during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan the Pakistani inter-service Intelligence Agency or ISI anonymously funneled money and equipment from the CIA and Saudi Arabia to guerrilla forces in Afghanistan the largest of these forces was the Mujahideen a diverse group of tribal warlords and jihadists with little in common besides the shared goal of driving out their foreign occupiers using Afghanistan's mountainous terrain to their advantage the Mujahideen waged a successful campaign of guerrilla warfare against the USSR when the Soviet Union was forced to pull out of the country in 1989 it led to the total collapse of the not-so Democratic Republic of Afghanistan just three years later it was during this period that the Taliban first came to prominence consisting of ethnic Pashtun students from traditional Islamic schools the Taliban initially seemed a preferable alternative to the Mujahideen who are now busy fighting amongst themselves taking advantage of this chaos the Taliban stormed onto the international stage when they captured the capital of Afghanistan Kabul and set up the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan this oppressive totalitarian government would be officially recognized only by Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates and of course Pakistan under the new regime Afghanistan quickly became a safe haven for terrorists drug traffickers and slavery rings by 1999 the country was exporting at least 4000 tons of opium poppies 75% of the world's supply this was often the sole source of income for Afghan villages ensuring that support for the Taliban would continue despite their brutal interpretation of Sharia law this made the country a perfect hiding place for al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden of course by 2001 the United States was no stranger to combat operations in the Middle East during the Gulf War u.s. forces had smashed Saddam Hussein's forces despite the dictator possessing the fourth largest standing army in the world invading Afghanistan however presented challenges not seen since Vietnam the US would face a decentralized guerrilla force many of whom were veterans of the soviet-afghan war while Saddam had arrogantly attempted to match the u.s. gun for gun the Taliban could simply retreat into their Mountain strongholds and wait for the storm to pass the key to a successful invasion was to cut off the Taliban from support in the Middle East that meant dealing with Pakistan whose inter-service Intelligence Agency had been a staunch ally of the Taliban since their inception the u.s. laid down a simple ultimatum Pakistan was either against the Taliban or against America when the leader of the ISI implored Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage to consider the complex history of the situation Armitage simply replied no the history begins today Pakistan formally renounced its support for the Taliban on the 15th of September just four days after 9/11 the next step was to establish contact with the sole opposition group to the Taliban left in Afghanistan the Northern Alliance operating out of the remote Panjshir Valley the Northern Alliance was chiefly composed of former Mujahideen who had agreed to set aside their differences and present a united front against their enemies on September 26th an eight-man team of CIA agents operating under the codename jawbreaker in the Panjshir Valley their purpose was to secure the cooperation of the Northern Alliance a task made considerably easier by the three million dollars in cash they had brought with them jawbreaker was then joined by task force dagger which began providing equipment and training to the Alliance militia ten days later the us-led coalition of Nations launched an aerial bombing campaign Taliban fighters all across the country had their morning prayer routines rudely interrupted by thousands of pounds of u.s. ordnance raining down on air bases and military infrastructure within 24 hours the Taliban's air defense network was obliterated and ground forces were clear to move in the coalition was made up of men from several nations including the United States United Kingdom Australia Canada and New Zealand but at the start only the US and the UK were directly involved additionally Special Forces units from dozens of countries were involved in the invasion the first Special Forces squads were inserted into the Apache air valley via the same route taken by the jawbreaker team there they met with the overall commander of the Northern Alliance Faheem Khan and began a long and arduous trek through the mountains to the Taliban controlled city of mazar-e-sharif simultaneously members of the 75th regiment of US Army Rangers air dropped onto an airstrip a south of Kandahar thanks to skirmishes with the Northern Alliance closer to the city only a single unfortunate Taliban soldier had been left as guard with that airstrip secured as a Forward Operating Base for later operations the assault on mazar-e-sharif began on the 9th of November the Taliban had entrenched around the city but their fortifications only prolonged the inevitable after the US Air Force spent a few days from the defenders 2000 Northern Alliance fighters led by General Abdul Rashid Dostum stormed the city to mop up any remaining resistance after a battle that lasted only 90 minutes 700 Taliban fighters had been killed or captured the Northern Alliance suffered fewer than 50 casualties the fall of mazar-e-sharif came as a major shock to both the Taliban and US Central Command both parties had assumed the city would resist for months and require a long period of brutal street fighting to liberate but now the road to Kabul lay wide open and to the Northern Alliance wasted no time advancing south towards the category to their astonishment though resistance and cobble fell only three days later this pattern continued for several weeks conventional resistance was all but pointless US air power was absolute and moving in the open was a death sentence the largest battle fought during this period was at the city of Kunduz where five thousand Taliban and al-qaida soldiers were besieged by coalition forces for 12 days during this time the 75th Ranger Regiment conducted assaults on Taliban camps in the mountains around Kandahar America was sending a strong message their forces to be anywhere at any time with no warning there was nowhere to hide however despite all progress things were about to take an abrupt turn for the worse on November 25th a prisoner revolt broke out at collage angee near mazar-e-sharif over 600 Taliban and al-qaeda POWs seized the fortress and its armory which included heavy weapons such as machine guns and rocket launchers although the revolt was eventually crushed the body of CIA agent Johnny Michael Spann was recovered from the rubble he was the first American killed in Afghanistan as a result of direct combat meanwhile the siege of conduce ended with the Taliban surrendering on mass however many of their leaders were mysteriously absent when the city fell it is suspected that they were airlifted out of the city by the ISI shortly before it fell this then known as the airlift of evil is one of the most controversial of the whole war and symbolic of the complicated political game being played out in the background of the invasion speaking of politics November's operations saw the rise of Hamid Karzai future president of Afghanistan using a small guerrilla force backed up by coalition troops and air support pros a liberated the town of Tarin Kot on the 15th and defended it against a Taliban counter-attack local militia then flocked to cars A's banner swelling his ranks to over 800 men on December 6 Kandahar the Taliban's last major stronghold in Afghanistan came under siege the city had already been the target of coalition bombing campaigns and had been hit by a wide variety of ordnance including Tomahawk cruise missiles now surrounded on all sides the defenders decided that negotiation might actually be preferable to death after all in the end the biggest obstacle US forces faced was a friendly fire incident that saw a bomb dropped near Hamid Karzai's position lightly wounding him and killing three American soldiers despite this negotiations were successful and Kandahar surrendered on the seventh with this victory secured Hamid Karzai became Afghanistan's new president which marked the end of the Taliban regime although there was no sign of Osama bin Laden or most of Al Qaeda's leadership US intelligence speculated that they fled to Jalalabad and to be coalition mounted a swift pursue but then the terrorist forces withdrew to one location everyone had hoped to avoid the infamous white mountain cave network known as Tora Bora not wishing to repeat Soviet mistakes coalition leaders decided to rely on local Afghan troops for the assault using money provided by the CIA they recruited 3,000 militia and sent an Army Special Forces team operation detachment alpha 572 to advise and support them initially things seemed to be going well the militia were able to take the mountain slopes and airstrikes were called on every insurgent suspected insurgent or suspicious patch of grass in the area fighting in the caves proved harder if the Afghan militia was not as well suited to the task as their CIA handlers para so in fact the militia leader was persuaded to open negotiations with the terrorists during the brief ceasefire that ensued most of all Qaeda's leaders likely including bin Laden escaped into Pakistan although deeply frustrated by their failure to capture the primary objective of the invasion coalition leaders tried to remain positive Afghanistan was now nominally free from Taliban rule and the democratic process seemed to have resumed aid workers and relief supplies were pouring in and it had cost the West fewer than a hundred casualties unfortunately for America the highly controversial occupation have just begun in February of 2002 a US intelligence analyst identified what was presumed to be a force of around 300 Taliban and al-qaeda fighters moving into the Shah ECOT Valley in response the u.s. airlifted 2,000 Special Forces soldiers into the area where they were joined by 1000 Afghan militia Operation anaconda began on March 2nd and would quickly become known as an unmitigated disaster from the moment they touched down the American forces found themselves in a Taliban kill zone the insurgents were heavily armed and the apache gunships that were supposed to provide air support found themselves under concentrated from rocket launchers and anti-materiel rifles to chinook helicopters were shot down and mortars bombarded us positions the Afghan militia arrived blundered around the valley in brightly colored trucks with headlights blazing making perfect targets for Taliban borders although numerical superiority training and air support eventually turned the tide in America's favor Operation anaconda demonstrated key weaknesses in both their tactics and coordination with local forces even after the valley was cleared a mere 23 Taliban bodies were found the exact number present in the valley has never been verified but it is thought that there were at least 600 or more initially suspected and most likely escaped over the border when the tide of battle turned 8 US soldiers were killed and dozens more wounded the furyk victory of Operation anaconda set the tone for US operations in Afghanistan for the next decade the start of the Iraq war in 2003 also diverted resources from the region leaving the new UN sanctions government all but powerless beyond the capital city of Kabul most importantly Osama bin Laden remained at large his whereabouts unknown and his debt to the American people still outstanding the manhunt for the notorious leader of al-qaeda would continue long after news from Afghanistan stopped making headlines we'll be covering the end of that manhunt next week with our video titled operation Neptune spear as the u.s.

       " \" have you been formally accused of misconduct while serving as a federal officer of the United States and need to prove your innocence well much like the presidents of the past you should use Squarespace whether you're looking to start a business or create an online portfolio Squarespace is the right platform for you stay tuned until the end of the video for an exclusive offer from Squarespace just for fans of the armchair historian hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian today's video is a short and unorthodox one for the channel all about Andrew Johnson the first American president to be impeached we recently experienced only the third impeachment in the entire country's history so it seems like an opportune time to go back and take a look at the first time this has happened Andrew Johnson the 17th President of the United States was formally impeached by the House of Representatives On February 24th 1868 and faced trial over the next three months the entire event was the greatest political spectacle of the early Reconstruction era as the country struggled to recover from its brutal civil war and overcome the bitter divisions that precipitated it the concept of impeachment in the United States finds its origin in the British legal process whereby all public officials including ministers of the crown were held accountable for misconduct the monarch however could not be impeached since the US didn't exactly begin its existence by quietly disagreeing with King George the third it shouldn't be a surprise to you that the American impeachment process is a bit more inclusive there are a lot of other videos on YouTube that will explain this process in more detail but for our purposes today you just have to know that in order for a president to be impeached and removed from office they must formally be accused by a simple majority in the House of Representatives then all the way on the other side of the Capitol building convicted by a two-thirds majority in the Senate when the house begins the formal process it votes on articles which are specific allegations of impeachable conduct so what constitutes an impeachable act well that's not super clear the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors is so uselessly vague that it usually just means whatever Congress thinks is bad enough in President Johnson's case his particular high crime / misdemeanor was the culmination of years of animosity with the very party that had put him in office without a 20-minute digression into nineteenth-century party politics here's the short version the Democratic and Republican parties as they existed in the 1860s bore almost no resemblance to the ones that are active today and if you're about to jump to a conclusion based on your modern-day preferences it's probably wrong the longer version which will still be way oversimplified is this at the time of the civil war the Democratic Party broadly supported slavery and represented land holding white planters in the south while the Republican Party represented the interests of city-dwelling northerners who tended to be abolitionists Southern Democrats who were worried that the election of Abraham Lincoln would lead to the eventual abolition of slavery spirited this secession movement that began in late 1860 not every southern slaveholding state left the Union to join the Confederacy in fact five so-called border states remained part of the Union and retained their democratic governments to shore up electoral support in these states Lincoln selected Democrat Andrew Johnson from Tennessee the only senator from a Confederate state to remain loyal to the Union as his running mate in 1864 even though he was elected as vice president on the Republican ticket the more radical elements of the Republican Party were suspicious of him from the very beginning some of these men had been fighting slavery for decades and doubted even Abraham Lincoln's commitment to protecting the rights of newly freedmen at the end of the civil war were holding the Confederate leaders accountable for treason when an assassin's bullet elevated the Tennessee into the presidency they expected even less even so the Radical Republicans counted a number of cabinet secretaries among their political allies notably Secretary of War Edwin Stanton he had served Lincoln as the civilian head of military affairs throughout the Civil War and supported a much harsher vision of reconstruction than either President considering that much of the South was now divided into military occupation districts administered by the War Department Stanton essentially governed half the country the combative secretary now perhaps the second most powerful man in the country was low-hanging fruit for a new president trying to consolidate his authority and protect his fellow southerners from punitive measures seeing this the Radical Republicans in Congress executed a political maneuver that may actually have been intended to trigger impeachment proceedings passing the tenure of office act on March 2nd 1867 it required the president to seek Senate approval to fire appointed officials and it passed despite Johnson's veto in a turn of events that surprised absolutely nobody Johnson eventually sought to test the law and wrest control of reconstruction back from Congress in August of 1867 without consulting Congress as the act required he suspended and replaced Edward Stanton Brendon wine Apple author of the impeaches the trial of Andrew Johnson and the dream of a just nation suggests that the Defiant president was self-sabotaging by Nature she writes the man had a penchant for martyrdom it allowed him to cling to the belief that he was cruelly beset deeply unappreciated wholly persecuted and denied the respect he rightfully deserved his temperament allowed no other choice he thus welcomed a struggle to the death with the hero himself going down to defeat in a blaze of unforgettable glory it is equally unsurprising that his enemies immediately reacted to his move now that Johnson had openly challenged the tenure of office act the House reinstated Stanton in January 1868 and moved forward with impeachment enraged by the audacity of the house Johnson fired Stanton once again and replaced him with Major General Lorenzo Thomas a longtime foe of Stanton not to be outdone Stanton had Thomas arrested for illegally seizing his office on February 24th the House voted 120 for 217 to impeach Johnson and establish a committee to draft the articles of impeachment the 11 Articles mostly stemmed from the dismissal of Stanton and the subsequent illegal use of war department funds and personnel the next week was spent approving rules of procedure for the trial which convened on March 5th with salmon P chase the chief of Justice of the Supreme Court presiding the process stretched on for two months during which the Radical Republicans work to convince their colleagues that Andrew Johnson had not only violated the tenure of office act but also conspired to keep the planter aristocracy in power over the new freedmen of the south Johnson's defense team argued that the law didn't even apply in this case the US Senate's official history recounts their argument that since Stanton had been appointed by Lincoln Johnson was not obligated to continue his service even if the senators accepted the Act as constitutional the defense team insisted Johnson could not be impeached for a mistaken interpretation of the law furthermore they claimed that Johnson's intent was to test the constitutionality of the act before the Supreme Court which he had the right to do the president's defense team was a 19th century legal dream team featuring Attorney General Henry Stanbury who had resigned his position to work on the case and former Supreme Court justice Benjamin Curtis at the advice of his counsel the bombastic president did not appear relying in part on the prestige of his advocates ironically another asset for the president was the very man positioned to replace him since the vice presidency was still vacant Benjamin Wade the president pro tempore of the Senate was next in line of secession one of the most outspoken radicals he advocated for such harsh reconstruction terms that he angered the party's moderate wing the possibility that Wade might be president if Johnson was removed they have been a powerful incentive for certain Republican senators to vote for acquittal as we mentioned earlier impeachment is a political process not a legal one and though Johnson may have violated the law as it was intended removing him was a difficult proposition it would have been yet another destabilizing event for a nation that had barely managed to cling together Benjamin Wade would have been the third president to take office within three years and the second one for whom nobody had cast a single ballot Senator James Grimes a Republican of Iowa perhaps summed up the opinion of many moderates when he said I cannot agree to destroy the harmonious working of the Constitution for the sake of getting rid of an unacceptable president on May 16th 1868 after two months of arguments and weeks of deliberation the Senate voted 35 to 19 to convict Johnson on the first charge one vote short of the two-thirds necessary to remove Johnson from office on May 26th the Senate voted to impeach Johnson on articles 2 and 3 but once again the vote tallies were the same that same day the trial was officially adjourned and Johnson remained president in hindsight it is possible that removing the president over such a politically polarized issue would have set a dangerous precedent in an already fragile Union it is also difficult to dispute that Johnson's lenient version of reconstruction gave rise to new white dominated southern governments that enacted Jim Crow laws throughout the former Confederacy America's first presidential impeachment is one of many events in the country's history that must be examined with nuance to understand its ramifications today I'm really hoping the

nation beset by enemies the entire map of eastern europe had been redrawn after the war and although poland was the largest and strongest of these new countries it was dwarved by the superpowers on the horizon to the west there was germany frustrated by the polish corridor cutting off its access to east prussia to the east there was the soviet union seething from its loss in the 1919-1920 polish soviet war desperate to secure its future as a sovereign state poland entered into a defensive alliance with france in 1921 however this distant ally offered scant protection against soviet aggression and poland began investing heavily in its eastern defenses it was only after poland's foreign minister joseph beck secured a non-aggression pact with the ussr in 1932 that tension seemed to ease then the unthinkable happened germany that supposedly humbled shell of a nation suddenly burst back onto the scene led by adolf hitler's national socialist party this resurgent an increasingly militant country now had its eyes dead set on the ethnically divided territories torn from it by the treaty of versailles but once again beck stepped up to defuse the situation wrangling another non-aggression pact from germany in 1934 however this house of cards came crashing down just a few years later after hitler seized the german ethnic sudetenland in october in 1938 poland used it as a precedent to annex zawoja a polish ethnic region in czechoslovakia this was a monumental blunder and caused both britain and france who saw the move as an act of aggression to reconsider their support of poland seeing an opportunity open up germany submitted a list of demands to poland that included annexing the free city of danzig and constructing an extra territorial road and railway through the polish corridor losing danzig would have cut off poland almost entirely from the sea and a german railway could have later been used to justify the seizure of the entire corridor thus back refused hitler's demands denouncing them as tantamount to a renunciation of polish sovereignty beck also refused to negotiate with the increasingly belligerent soviets and spent most of the next year campaigning for western support in the event of hostilities which he now saw as inevitable as tensions escalated plans were drawn up to defend against an attack from the north and west however they had to be immediately reworked after germany completely annexed czechoslovakia in march of 1939 which stretched the polish-german border much further to the south suddenly poland had to worry about every point on the compass later that month on march 31st poland formed a tentative military alliance with both britain and france with the former promising to support poland's independence by august 1939 hitler was seeking any pretext to justify an invasion of poland as panzers massed along the border marshall edvard ritz schmuckel commander-in-chief of poland's military tried desperately to mobilize polish forces but his efforts were foiled by the uk and france who insisted that the polish offer no provocation to the germans and so their army sat idle until the 30th of august when ritz schmiegel finally ordered a general mobilization just one day after general mobilization was ordered in poland german troops dressed in polish uniforms launched a series of false flag attacks against german military and civilian targets hitler furiously denounced these supposed polish attacks in an evening radio broadcast that night which he used to conceal his real intentions war was inevitable prior to this point polish generals had recognized the impossibility of a conventional defensive posture their strategy named plan west was instead to delay german forces at the frontiers while falling back to a defensive line along the major rivers there they hoped to hold the line until their allies launched an invasion of germany the success of plan west depended entirely on britain and france upholding their guarantees poland's military strategists headed by martial ritz did not think that their allies would simply sit back and watch them succumb to the third reich yet there were some like chief of the general staff that's what stahevich who had doubts about the plan's feasibility inside the polish headquarters in warsaw we can imagine a conversation like this taking place at the outbreak of war the polish army had mobilized only about 500 000 men of which half were combat ready throughout the war an additional 500 000 men would be raised many of whom could have been mustered much earlier had the british and french not discouraged polish mobilization by september 1939 the army was organized into 26 infantry divisions eight cavalry brigades one motorized brigade three mountain brigades two armored brigades and four independent tank battalions the soldiers were reasonably motivated and disciplined but they were poorly equipped due to poland's relative poverty with obsolete communication systems and a lack of motorized transport although unlike what propaganda footage shows the german army was not heavily motorized or mechanized either and both sides relied heavily on horses on the ground poland's latest tank was the 7tp whose 37 millimeter gun could easily knock out the panzer one or panzer ii and even destroy the panzer iv [Music] unfortunately the 7tp was a rare sight on the battlefield only 161 were in service by 1939. a much more common sight was poland's 575 tks takets while completely adorable these tiny vehicles were barely more useful than armored cars and often less reliable lastly the poles had also purchased 88 tanks from their british and french allies prior to the war in the skies the polish air force had fewer than 400 modern aircraft poland's latest fighter the p24 was highly competitive with foreign planes when it was introduced in 1936 but it was outclassed by the time of the invasion to make matters worse poland had exported many p-24s to other countries leaving few for national defense thus the polish air force had to rely primarily on obsolete p-11s finally at sea the polish navy consisted of just five submarines and four destroyers as well as various smaller vessels luckily before the german attack most destroyers retreated to england while the submarines were ordered to mine the polish coast around danzig and interdict enemy ships attempting to stage amphibious landings at 4 45 a.m on september 1st 1939 the german invasion began with the pre-dreadnought schleswig-holstein bombarding a military depot in danzig warrant officer vwadiswolf bharan recalled of the attack the air rocked fountains of sand stones and smoke rose up shattered trunks and branches of trees pieces of human bodies and weapons flew in the air as the sun rose marshall ritz schmiegel's worst fears were confirmed as german armored spearheads punched straight through the confused polish lines with barely a pause army group north attacked the polish corridor army group south attacked woods krakow and warsaw and forces from the german puppet state of slovakia attacked poland's southern regions lieutenant jan karsky detailed his division's ordeal the extent of death destruction and disorganization this combined fire caused in three short hours was incredible by the time our whips were sufficiently collected even to survey the situation it was apparent that we were in no position to offer any serious resistance by the end of september 2nd the polish defenses had fallen apart nonetheless some units resisted fiercely especially the polish cavalry brigades considered the elite units of the polish military far from charging into battle solely armed with sabers and lances these modern cavalrymen also carried bolt-action rifles anti-tank rifles and machine guns giving them access to some of the most concentrated firepower of the early war period at the battle of makra the vowenska cavalry brigade destroyed at least 50 german tanks and inflicted some 800 casualties in one of the only polish victories of the war when not fighting directly the polish cavalry acted as a mobile reserve galloping to the front lines and then dismounting to fight as infantry polish armored trains also mounted considerable resistance and wreaked havoc on enemy supply lines and communications using the country's extensive rail network and forests for cover discounted by the germans as obsolete the self-sustaining behemoths which came in light and heavy varieties bristled with artillery pieces and machine guns overall the 10 or so armored trains fought in about 90 battles during the invasion september 3rd britain and france finally declared war on germany after repeated pleas from polish diplomats the polish people were overjoyed with the news but no military support was forthcoming polish forces continued losing ground on all fronts and on september 5th army's krakow woods prusa and poznan withdrew beyond the viscula and dunietz rivers abandoning western poland unfortunately the rivers had almost completely dried up due to drought so they posed little obstacle to the german advance to make matters worse fleeing refugees clogged the roads hampering efforts to contain the enemy breakthrough desperate for any assistance poland urged its allies to attack germany's extremely weak western front france responded by launching an offensive into the tsar region of germany on september 7th just as the polls had hoped early reports told the french making remarkable progress capturing towns and overwhelming all german resistance once the british joined in the germans would have no choice but to divert forces to the west and poland would be saved but then on the 13th the unthinkable occurred the french despite their crushing momentum halted their advance days later they pulled back to the relative safety of the maginot line the news came like a slap in the face to the poles without the help of their allies plan west was utterly ruined one of the few bright spots in this otherwise dark time was the aerial defense of warsaw between september 1st and the 6th polish fighters and anti-aircraft guns downed 80 german bombers and damaged more than 20 others however the situation deteriorated as the germans escalated their bombing campaign on september 10th enemy bombers carried out 17 consecutive bombing raids overwhelming the polish defenses meanwhile enemy tanks were closing in on the capital the poles were prepared for this thanks to the effort of over 150 000 civilian volunteers who had labored for weeks to prepare a network of anti-tank ditches and improvised barricades transforming warsaw into a fortress on september 8th the polish defenders watched with a mix of fear and steely resolve as german tanks appeared on the horizon the attack began in the south as panzers overran several suburbs but when the germans attacked from the west the poles pushed them back from behind their makeshift barricades when the germans came again on the 9th with reinforcements in tow the stubborn poles repelled them again between these two assaults the poles destroyed 80 tanks and successfully denied the enemy further access to the western suburbs as the battle raged on the poles made up for their shortage of anti-tank weapons with sheer ingenuity for example they covered a street with turpentine and lit it on fire when enemy tanks got close enough some poles even lit mattresses on fire and hurled them onto the germans from balconies yet everywhere around warsaw poland's defenses were collapsing on the 10th brits ordered a general retreat toward the romanian bridgehead to relieve army woods army's pozman and pemorgia counter-attacked the left flank of the german forces attacking warsaw between the 19th and the 15th although they were initially successful low morale poor coordination between units and enemy air superiority turned the battle of zura into a crushing defeat as the germans encircled and destroyed them between the 15th and 19th polish defenses along the narev river collapsed on the 12th allowing the germans to advance toward warsaw from the east and lay siege to the city three days later combined with the survivors of the battle of zura the defenders of warsaw now numbered 140 000 soldiers opposing them were 175 000 germans supported by 1000 artillery pieces and over a thousand aircraft for an entire week the poles endured a night and day bombardment as the germans prepared to storm the city however on the 15th of september the warsaw garrison managed to repel all attacks on the pragas suburb and two full-scale attacks on the 23rd and 26th as the siege continued strange reports began arriving from the east soviet forces were pouring across the border and the germans were retreating before them to the beleaguered defenders of levof this meant salvation after enduring a grueling siege by german forces the city opened its gates to the red army without hesitation but even as polish citizens prepared to celebrate with their unlikely saviors the horrible truth was revealed the soviets were not here to help but merely to take their share of the spoils it was at this point that the polish high command lost confidence in the defense of the country so it fled to the border of romania to the small town of kuri abandoned by their leadership the remaining polish forces had no idea how to react to the soviet invasion some units continued fighting but they could not stop the twin juggernauts from squeezing the life out of poland [Music] on september 27th after three weeks of staunch resistance the warsaw garrison finally surrendered in the face of the near complete destruction of the city one later wrote we listened silently to these grim words there were no questions or comments our minds recognized the inevitability of capitulation but our feelings could not be reconciled to it was this to be the end fighting continued on october 6 as the germans and soviets eliminated the last pockets of resistance the brave but unsuccessful defense of poland came at a steep price poland sustained between eight hundred and eighty thousand and one million two hundred and fifty three thousand casualties germany sustained between forty four thousand and fifty one thousand four hundred and the ussr between three thousand eight hundred and thirteen thousand during the invasion nevertheless about 100 000 polish soldiers managed to escape and they would go on to join the allied war effort seeing action throughout the remainder of the second world war in november 1939 the polish government in exile announced that it would fight for the restoration of poland despite their resentment towards britain and france for failing to come to their aid in the invasion they agreed to cooperate with them and organize a resistance movement within their occupied country this culminated in the heroic but doomed warsaw uprising a fascinating topic for a future video despite their devastating loss in the invasion the fight for poland was far from over [Music] you\",\n",

impregnable Belgian Fortress of a Bini male had fallen to a handful of german paratroopers generals such as Heinz Guderian and Erlin Rommel were teaching Europe to flinch at the very mention of Panzer tanks while the Luftwaffe seem to have no equal in the skies above Belgium and France on every front the enemy was either in full retreat or being encircled the lowland countries once so troublesome during the Great War were little more than speed bumps on the road to Paris at the Battle of sedan the Vava conducted the largest bombing campaign in history flying nearly 4,000 individual sorties against enemy positions and causing thousands to flee in panic as the French line collapsed Army Group a under general GERD von Rundstedt started to drive a massive wedge between the bulk of the French army and to the British Expeditionary Force which had recently landed in Flanders the offensive was not intended to last long but the impetuous Panzer generals Rommel and Guderian openly defied orders and plunged straight towards the channel leaving chaos and devastation in their wake but the Allies were not intent to sit idly by and allow the Germans to encircle them on May 21st 2000 French and British soldiers intercepted two of Rommels Panzer divisions and an SS Division at the Battle of Arras although briefly startled by the bold move Rommel quickly rallied his men and forced the Allied troops to retreat under the cover of darkness far from delaying the German advance the counter-attack simply encouraged Rommel Antico Darien to reach the coast as fast as possible the German force was like a bull in a china shop and the Allies were the fly buzzing in its ear inadvertently causing the ensuing devastation meanwhile as General Fedor font Bach commander of army Group B dealt with belgian resistance to the east mechanized elements of Army Group a continued thundering West at breakneck speed Guderian's Panzers plowed through two unprepared British divisions on the 19th capturing vital bridge heads over the Somme and then swinging north towards Bologna and Calais as a result of these decisive maneuvers German forces had an encirclement at Dunkirk firmly established by the 22nd despite this unparalleled advance the German soldiers scarcely had time to dip his aching feet into the soothing waters of the English Channel before British evacuation ships appeared on the horizon although Luftwaffe bombers had already destroyed the port facilities British and French men began lining up on the seawall and beaches of Dunkirk waiting to board the boats deployed by the larger ships as they reached the shallow harbour initially the Germans were unconcerned these were not the mighty battleships of the Royal Navy but a ragtag assortment of destroyers and transports obviously scraped together last minute to evacuate a few thousand key personnel but as time wore on more and more ships started to trickle in and the trickle became a deluge generals and admirals alike began scratching their heads all pondering the same question where on earth had the British acquired so many transports then as reports from Luftwaffe reconnaissance flights began to trickle in

their massed propellers almost have enough to deafen observers below during had won his argument Army Group a would halt and the mighty Luftwaffe would bomb Dunkirk and the evacuation fleet into submission although the tank crews were grateful for the respite their officers made no pretense of agreeing with Hitler's new strategy general Franz Halder wrote in his diary the air force on which all hopes are pinned is dependent on the weather this divergence of views resulted in a tug of war which costs more nerves than it does actual conduct of the operations however the battle will be won this way or that the reasons behind Hitler's decision to halt the advance of the German armor on May 24th are hotly debated to this day while good arguments have been made on all sides a lot of it boils down to as octa disease ACTA and although it's undoubtedly true that Hitler made many crucial errors during the war his decision to halt the ground forces at Dunkirk was not entirely without merit the ver muffed was in serious danger of becoming a victim of its own success their advance had stretched German supply lines and left the Panzer divisions sure on fuel and ammunition the men were exhausted the tanks ill-suited for urban warfare the infantry lagging behind the armor and the artillery lagging behind to the infantry it's also worth mentioning that after the war that was German generals who survived the conflict frequently ascribed to Hitler their own mistakes resulting in even further misinformation regarding Hitler's decision-making as one example Panzer General Kleist of Army Group a stated later I must say that the English managed to escape that trap in Dunkirk which I laid only with the personal help of Hitler the fact of the matter is that the English would have been unable to get into Dunkirk because I had them covered then Hitler personally ordered that I should withdraw my troops when Gen Kleist met Hitler a few days after the evacuation he was so furious he dared to remark that a great opportunity had been lost at Dunkirk Hitler in a perhaps uncharacteristic display of flippancy calmly replied that maybe so but I did not want to send the tanks into the Flanders marshes and besides the British won't come back in this war initially it seems like Hitler's assumption had merit the British were fleeing in droves scrambling aboard their ships while being repeatedly strafed by any one of our fighters that broke through their air defenses one German pilot wrote after the war I hated Dunkirk it was just cold-blooded killing the beaches were jammed with soldiers I went up and down spraying them with bullets but as the day's wore on it became clear to observers that despite during's assurances various factors had drastically limited the effectiveness of the Luftwaffe the Dunkirk pocket was far enough from German airfield sket fighters and dive bombers like the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and to the euchre's Ju 87 needed to expend the majority of their fuel just to reach the area twin-engine bombers such as the Heinkel 8111 had an even shorter flight time leaving no room for error during attack runs that were already made frustratingly inaccurate due to the thick low-hanging clouds shrouding the Harbor during dogfights the BF 109 feet faster than the British hurricane and have much better camouflage however German pilots quickly came to hate the Supermarine Spitfire which had better performance at higher altitudes but even with the Luftwaffe throwing almost a thousand fighters and bombers at a foe only mustering half that number British transport ships continued to slip away through the fog furious with the situation there moshed commander-in-chief walter von Brauchitsch dared to challenge hitler's decision to restrict the advance of Army Group A with great reluctance Hitler actually agreed rescinding the order on May 26th finally let off the leash rune step immediately began plans to advance however the same day Army Group B which had been pestering the British from the east launched a major attack across the EPO main canal realizing he was faced by a mere two divisions general fedor von Bach ordered a massive artillery and then in advance by three of his own divisions hectic fighting ensued all along the canal and for a moment it seemed as if the Germans would successfully break through the British flanks and encircle several battalions of troops but eventually the enemy had their backs to the wall and an account from the battle from the 41st Panzer Corps vividly illustrates the situation at every position heavy fighting has developed in consequence the Corps has not been able to make any notable headway to the east or northeast casualties in personnel and equipment are Grievous the enemy are fighting tenaciously and to the last man remain at their posts if they are shelled out of one position they shortly reappear in another but despite their fierce defense the British quickly began falling back German troops stormed across the canals only for Royal artillery shells to begin raining down on them even so every soldier knew that they were on the cusp of victory unlike anything that Kaiser could have dreamed of and they pushed forward with dogged determination soon after the Luftwaffe avenged the sacrifices made by the ground troops when they spend two hours bombing and strafing allied columns as they advance to retreat across one of only two ridges on the easier canal a huge number of British vehicles were either destroyed or abandoned in subsequent attacks disabled a large portion of their artillery allowing the German infantry to breathe a collective sigh of relief although the British and French were now falling back advancement on the eastern flank was still hampered by a large concentration of Belgian troops but unwilling to sacrifice thousands more lives in an obviously futile gesture of defiance Belgian King Leopold the third who was himself commanding troops agreed to an unconditional surrender on the afternoon of the 28th taking advantage of this situation von Bach ordered a swift advance managing to catch three British divisions by surprise as they attempted to reposition the eastern flank was now in disarray with British lines slowly but surely falling back before the seemingly unstoppable German war machine meanwhile on the western flank Ronstadt had required nearly sixteen hours to prepare for his own offensive maneuvers early on May 27th he had sent the Panzers surging forward across the canal results were immediate with Erwin Rommel brilliantly outmaneuvering the retreating French forces and isolating nearly 35,000 men in the town of Lille the jaws of the German trap were now closing shut driving the Allies back into a defensive line a mere seven miles or eleven kilometers from the coast with Dunkirk at the center throughout this period the Luftwaffe continued to harass the British evacuation clearly dropping an estimated 45,000 bombs during its 12 major raids on the Dunkirk pocket but for all of göring's bluster he proved unable to command the weather which remained mostly overcast until June 1st as fun Haldor put it in his diary the bad weather has grounded our air force and now we must stand by and watch how countless thousands of the enemy are getting away to England right under our noses this bullets filled the air over Dunkirk so too did heated words fill the air back at German High Command Hitler was by now thoroughly fed up with what he saw as an atmosphere of mistrust and insubordination and took swift action to rectify the situation impetuous men like Heinz Guderian were reassigned to the south while the forces encircling Dunkirk were placed under the control of general georg von kuchler whom hitler regarded as a much more steady and reliable officer although kuchler quickly ordered an assault his lack of familiarity with the new command resulted in a breakdown of communications in spite of these issues the Germans achieved a major victory on the first day of June when they finally over and the French force defending the town of Lille despite being encircled days earlier the defenders had required seven full divisions for 160 thousand men to fully isolate and contain them with these divisions free to join the main attack victory was inevitable and as the weather cleared the sky turned black with Luftwaffe planes eager to avenge their fallen comrades yet against all odds the remaining 40,000 members of the French first Army continued to resist amid the smoking rubble and greeted every German advance with a hail of gunfire final French word owl at fort de dune held out until June 3rd it's garrison only surrendering after German bombs had all but leveled the structure a day later German forces finally captured the harbour just in time to watch the last British transport ship steamed away into the channel as the dust settled the Germans finally had time to count their losses although 20,000 brave men had been sacrificed to collapse the Allied pocket the enemy had lost three times that number and the Germans had captured at least 100,000 French POWs arguments raged to this day over the exact number of planes lost during the engagement but Goering confidently claimed that his brave pilots had achieved a favorable kill ratio in every encounter and inflicted severe casualties on the evacuation route the Germans also captured a vast quantity of allied war materiel there had been no room on the civilian transport ships for vehicles of any sort and these now clogged the roads for miles in every direction tanks trucks armored cars artillery and motorcycles many still fuelled and loaded with ordnance

I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian today's video the Battle of Marathon a battle that saw the forces of the city-state of Athens and its allies face off against the might of the Persian Empire pop culture tends to portray Marathon as a glorious triumph of the brave heroes of the Western democracy soundly defeating the evil forces of Eastern tyranny but in reality the Battle of Marathon was far more complicated further muddied by many conflicting historical accounts now let's dive in our story begins in 490 BCE the year that Persian King Darius the first dispatched an armada of 600 ships carrying an army of 26,000 disciplined soldiers into the Aegean the expedition set out to destroy or subjugate several Greek islands and city-states but their main targets were the cities of Athens and Eritrea the reason nine years before those two cities had sent troops and ships to support a rebellion of several Greek cities in the Persian Empire a conflict known as the Ionian revolt the revolt was eventually crushed but not before Ionian forces captured and destroyed a Persian city of Sardis the fiery destruction of Eritrea was not a random act aggression but one of retribution a city for a city but Darius's expedition was not solely motivated by revenge the Athenians and Eritrea --nz had not only helped burn a Persian city they had presented a challenge to the Persian kings Authority darius having spent years securing his throne after usurping it in 522 could not let such a challenge stand he demanded pay back the army he assembled to do the job was led by generals Dottie's and art a furnace consisting of light infantry and heavy cavalry that Persian troops were drawn from all over the vast multicultural Persian Empire before pursuing their main goals the Persian Force spent some time island hopping across the aegean sea beyond simple conquest and securing supply lines taking the islands allowed the Persian generals to engage in a bit of propaganda after burning the Defiant city of Naxos and enslaving its inhabitants the Persian fleet sailed to Delos which surrendered immediately danti's proceeded to make lavish sacrifices to the Greek god Apollo before leaving the occupied city intact soon after the Persians reached a defiant Eritrea and we all know how that went the message was clear surrender would be respected but resistance would be crushed after destroying Eritrea the Persian forces sailed down the coast of Attica and landed at the plain of Marathon about 40 kilometres 425 miles northeast of Athens and it is here that the fate of Athenian independence would be decided the athenians scrambled to respond hastily dispatching their army from the city to intercept the vast Persian force before it could establish a foothold on the Greek mainland the Greeks arrived with a force numbering about 11,000 hoplite infantry 10,000 from Athens and 1,000 provided by their ally Plataea the Athenian soldiers in keeping with Athens then newly established Democratic traditions were led by ten generals one from each of the ten tribes of Athens in addition there was one senior general or Paul Marsh in charge of all the tribal commanders at this time the polemarch was a man named calamitous about whom very little is known likewise most of the tribal commanders are unknown with the exception of a rather famous character by the name of mill tidings mill tidies was born in Athens in 550 BCE to a noble family and in five sixteen he came to rule over a Greek city on what is now the Gallipoli Peninsula in Anatolia milt Heidi served for a few years as a Persian vassal after Darius the first conquered the region but fled to Athens after falling out of favor with the king ancient accounts claimed that the other generals at marathon all deferred to mill tidies given his first-hand knowledge of Persian tactics but there is reason to be skeptical of this detail mill Tidy son Simon was a leading figure in Athenian politics in the decades after the battle with this in mind it's easy to see why we know so much about mill tidies and why we should take some of the claims about him with a grain of salt when the Greeks arrived at marathon they quickly moved to block the Persian army from advancing further inland as soon as they set up their camp the Greeks realized they were at a serious disadvantage their army had no cavalry who were skilled archers to match those in the Persian army and they were outnumbered more than two to one looking to even the odds the Athenians sent a runner to request reinforcements from Sparta and great news the Spartans agreed to send aid not right away an important religious festival was ongoing at the time and the Spartans couldn't interrupt the festival by going to war without breaking divine law the Spartans may have taken war very were just as serious about their parties therefore the Athenians couldn't expect Spartan reinforcements for another ten days at this point both sides were reluctant to force an engagement despite Persia superior numbers and flexible army composition the Greeks boasted a strong defensive position in the hills with both of their flanks secured the bristling Spears of the Greek balance also presented a very persuasive argument against a direct assault and likewise the widely feared heavy cavalry and trained archers of the persians presented an equally persuasive argument against a greek assault across the plain a retreat back to the safety of athens walls might have made strategic sense at this point but it was politically unsafe moat IEDs and calamitous knew that there was a strong faction in athens that supported persia and wanted to turn the city over in exchange for mercy and political power for themselves the commanders needed a decisive victory over the Persians at marathon to silence these sympathizers retreat was not an option and so the two armies simply waited staring each other down for eight days straight this delay benefitted the Greeks much more than the Persians as every day they waited brought the Spartan Army closer and the Persians only had so much food to sustain their large army what finally broke the stalemate is uncertain ancient sources are divided on the details and modern historians haven't been able to reach a consensus either we do know two things though that the Greeks most likely attacked the Persians and the Persian cavalry was not present for the battle the question of where the Persian horses went has been debated by scholars for centuries and there are two main theories the cavalry was either reembarked or it had been sent away from the rest of the army to forage equally uncertain is why the Greeks chose to attack when they did ancient sources again contradict each other but it is likely that something forced the Greeks to attack be it the to Athens from the Persians reembarked away whatever the case the cavalry was gone and melt IEDs seized the initiative he ordered the army into formation stretching out his forces to match the width of the Persian line by thinning the center ranks and concentrating his troops on the flanks the long line and thickened flanks were meant to prevent the larger Persian army from enveloping the smaller creeks force in melee if the Greeks were surrounded they would be slaughtered having arranged his forces melt IDs promptly began the attack the Greeks marched steadily across most of a 1,500 meter or 4900 foot gap between them and the Persians then upon entering the roughly 200 meter or 650 foot effective range of the Persian archers the Greek surprised the Trojans by breaking into a full run toward the enemy thanks to their large shields farmer and the momentum of their charge the Greeks were able to shrug off most of the Persian arrows as they ran and soon entered melee with the enemy for a moment it seemed as though Milt Heidi's attack would fail however since the Greek center ranks were thinner the Persians were able to break through the line there and push forward but the thicker Greek flanks succeeded in starting around allowing them to attack the advancing Persian force from the sides and the rear enveloping them a happy accident note IDs tactic to avoid envelopment by the Persians had allowed the Greeks to envelop their allies instead and soon they inflicted heavy losses by doing so the envelopment eloped the Persians morale and soon Arau among the entire Persian force started as they quickly began retreating to their ships all the while the Greeks continued to slaughter them by the time the Persians had withdrawn 6400 of them lay dead by either drowning in the nearby Marsh to escape or by being cut down in the retreat by comparison the Athenians lost a measly 192 men but among the Greek dead was the polemarch calamitous who according to legend died with so many Persian Spears through his body that he remained upright after death though the Greeks had won a remarkable victory at marathon they had no time to celebrate the rest of the Persian army was now sailing toward a defenseless Athens and the Greeks had to march through the night to make it back to the city in time to protect it they arrived just in time to see the Persian ships approaching finding the city fully defended Dottie's turned his fleet around and abandoned the expedition ending the first greco-persian war while the Persian expedition had successfully annihilated Eritrea and expanded the territory of the Persian Empire the surprising victory by the Athenians at marathon carried huge symbolic importance the Athenians capitalized on this using widespread propaganda across the Greek world to inflate the importance of the relatively minor victory as a result the influence and prestige of Athens grew exponentially after marathon propelling them to prominence among the city-states of Greece you may be wondering by now what this ancient battle has to do with the marathon race well the legend goes that after the Battle of Marathon the Greeks needed to let the people of Athens know that the Persians had been defeated to prevent the pro Persian faction from surrendering the city so they sent a runner back to Athens to announce the victory the messenger ran a whole 26 miles or 42 kilometers back to Athens proclaimed the Greeks had won and then immediately died of exhaustion true or not the story was compelling enough that 2,000 years later the planners of the first modern Olympics used it as inspiration for the marathon race now

accounts it is undeniable that the Athenians overcame the odds to push back the Persian army but in the grand scheme of things the Battle of Marathon was little more than a small skirmish with in a much larger conflict the Battle of Marathon looms so large in history today only because the Athenians wanted it too proclaiming themselves the saviors of Greece allowed the Athenians to dominate it themselves if you want to learn more about the greater context of the greco-persian wars then I can highly recommend you watch a video over on and Victor's channel hey and Victor could you tell us what you'll be covering hey Griffin so in my video where we take a look at the macro-level perspective of the greco-persian wars and seek to answer the question why did the Persians failed now to do so we're gonna be giving you some context on well what was the persian objective in greece anyways to what extent was that objective achieved and then ultimately why did they fail now traditionally the narrative goes that the persians failed mostly because it's like a quantity versus quality you know that typical matchup of which is better and it's portrayed through history and even by the greeks that well the persians had this quantity millions upon millions of these chaffed type troops who butted heads against the small but elite greeks and that's kind of a simple narrative but in my video we dive into the details of why that's not necessarily accurate so we are gonna look at comparative army qualities we're going to be looking at troop numbers over the course of the war and then also we're gonna be looking at battle performance and track record so there's a lot of factors that are you know kind of hidden below this surface-level narrative and that's what we're really getting into in my video so if that's something that interests you definitely check it out [Music]\",\n",

Mary and Jerusalem better known as the Teutonic Knights these devout warriors were notoriously troublesome and often created unease in countries that hosted them as they were always looking to carve out their own sovereign state in 1230 the order was residing in Poland after their most recent eviction this time from Hungary searching for an opportunity to shout Deus vult they joined the so-called northern crusade to Christianize the old Prussians a pagan people inhabiting portions of present-day Poland Latvia Lithuania and by the beginning of the following century pagan Lithuania posed the only remaining serious threat to Christian domination of Eastern Europe having defeated a crusade launched by the livonian brothers of the sword yet another group of warrior monks this defeat was so thorough that the livonians joined with the Teutonic order whose conquest of the Baltic coast was so successful that within a century the indigenous Prussian beliefs and mythology had been largely suppressed but although the problem of Prussian paganism had been solved the Polish were now faced with a group of heavily armed extremely religious squatters sitting right on their doorstep refusing to leave the order's territory now included some of the most lucrative trade routes in northern Europe and they operated independently of the Polish aristocracy paying neither tithes nor taxes as their wealth increased the order established formidable castles like the fortress of malbork and Marienberg and Koenigsberg castle in 1306 the polish king called on the order to enforce his claim to the contested Duchy of pommes irelia the Knights quickly secured the Duchy but then used their wealth to buy the rival claim for themselves incensed at this blatant betrayal the king of Poland declared war however neither side gained the upper hand after two entire Wars the Treaty of Kulish in 1343 saw minor territorial concessions by the Knights but enforced their claims on Palmer Elia helm Noland and Danzig and from here on Eastern Europe would remain stable and secure except that it didn't for the next half century the two E's poles Lithuanians and even the Golden Horde found themselves in a perpetual state of petty wars with enemies closing in from all directions the Lithuanian Grand Duke yo Kyla hoping to strengthen his position signed the union of crevel with the poles in 1385 the stipulations included an agreement to convert his people to roman catholicism and a marriage to the female king of poland yot viga establishing Co rulership once he was baptized in 1386 he went by the name of yoga WA shortly thereafter a civil war was started in Lithuania and one faction led by Yaga was cousin Vito to us entered into an alliance with you guessed it the Teutonic order to secure the Alliance they nominally ceded the coastal territory of samogitia to the order after compromising with Vito to us the Civil War ended in 1392 however doopty Ogawa wasn't too pleased seeing the Teutons still lingering in his territory during the turn of the century the newly Christianized Lithuania declared support for a pagan revolt in samalisha in 1409 against the Teutonic Knights Poland announced her support for Lithuania shortly thereafter while neither Lithuania nor Poland directly attacked the order fearing retaliation from the Holy Roman Empire were hungry no such concerns faced the Teutonic order who openly launched its invasion led by Ulrich von Union the order's Grandmaster the Germanic Knights over and several towns and castles before things could escalate the King of Bohemia stepped in to mediate the dispute what followed was an episode of intrigue and corruption that would impress even a Game of Thrones fan after receiving a pledge of support from Hungary the Teutonic Knights bribed the King of Bohemia into upholding their claim on samogitia the poles meanwhile contacted the remnants of the livonian Brotherhood and obtained a pledge of neutrality both parties also engaged in liberal accusations of heresy blasphemy and just about anything else they thought would tarnish the reputation of the other party in the eyes of Christendom eventually however things calmed down long enough for an official truce to be recognized of course rivalries never die with an armistice in late June of 1410 the poles and Lithuanians gathered their levies into a single army of nearly 40,000 their intention was to utterly break the power of the Teutonic Knights by capturing marienburg the capital of the monastic state caught off-guard by this massive concentration of enemy troops Ulrich von union decided to meet this army with all the forces he could muster Western European mercenaries adventurers and Crusaders were rallied all eager to defeat the poles and their despised allies the fact that these pagans were getting considerably less pagan by the day didn't seem to matter this combined force numbered some 30,000 men and checked the advance of the Polish Lithuanian army between the villages of Tannenberg and greenwall on July 15th 1410 while the Crusader is baked in their armor under the hot Summer Sun in the open the Polish and Lithuanian troops were deployed in a forest the two sides could not be more different in a tactical outlook the Knights and Crusaders were heavily armored and their forces consisted mostly of shock cavalry and heavy infantry while the Polish Knights were heavily armored their lithuanian allies were not as they primarily used mounted bowmen or light cavalry to assail their enemies the Knights had brought with them to bomb barns heavy cannon usually reserved for sieges which immediately opened up on their adversaries unfortunately the Bombardier's consistently failed to hit anything of know throughout much of the bombardment at the poles remained in the forest which was flanked by marshes on either side desperate to lure the Polish host into battle upon Union sent two swords to goad the baptised and Lithuanian born King Ogawa of Poland and his cousin Grand Duke vetoed us of Lithuania into battle stating that the weapons should prove useful if the two leaders actually chose to fight Yaga WA responded to von unions ploy by saying we accept the swords you send us and in the name of Christ before whom all stiff necked pride must bow we shall do battle shortly thereafter the Allied hosts marched out of the woods to face their foes the Grand Duke proceeded to send forward his entire contingent comprised mostly of light cavalry against the Teutonic left flank this attack took nearly an hour to fight off but the Lithuanian life horse was no match with a heavily armored Knights and soon fled [Applause] inspired by the site of their pagan foes in full retreat the Teutonic Knights lost all discipline and charged forward with all of their cavalry on both flanks with the exception of some of their Eastern troops the Lithuanian Light Horse continued to flee from the field of battle into marshes and woods drawing away many of the orders Knights in the meantime the rest of von union's army fell on that of the Polish King hitting him in the front and right flank the Teutonic Knights nearly annihilated the Polish right wing but a unit from Smolensk held them back at great cost after fighting had continued for several hours it looked like the poles could be beaten with one last mighty effort von union through forward more heavy cavalry in the hopes of smashing the Polish line for a while this seemed to work as the banner of Krakoff the King's personal standard was captured by the Germanic troops then at this critical juncture the Polish reserves rushed forward checking the charge of the Knights and recapturing the banner von Union kept fighting throwing in his remaining 16 banners of heavy cavalry but the Polish infantry and cavalry armed to the teeth with Spears and Lance's prevented them from making any clear breakthrough by this point the Lithuanians made an unexpected return to the battle having both exhausted and defeated their pursuers they immediately crashed into the teutonic left plant which was still bogged down attacking people - confused by the sudden return of their pagan foes the Knights began to break from the field in a panic on Union rallied his troops to make one last stand out in the open deploying them in a full battle line where he hoped to outflank the Allies but the polls checked his move once again then counter attacked using their superior numbers to roll up both flanks of the order in the ensuing chaos most of the orders High Command was killed but the absolute leader of their fortunes came when the brave Oregon Union was struck down falling amongst the bodies of men he had fought with all day long utterly demoralized his troops fled back to camp where they attempted to circle their supply wagons into a makeshift fortification but this was swiftly overrun and the slaughter continued until darkness finally allowed the Tattered Remnants of the order to slip away the king of poland entity Grand Duke of Lithuania were doubtless pleased with their joint victory some 8000 Teutonic soldiers and their allies had been killed and to nearly double that number been captured the polls have lost less than four thousand matter although the Polish victory had been stunning the Teutonic Knights managed to hold on to Marienberg the strategic objective of the campaign the Knights also lost little territory in the subsequent peace treaty in 1411 due to in part the belated arrival of their livonian vassals

the volatile situation present in the Middle East at the time the relationship between Iran and Iraq was particularly unstable as Saddam Hussein desperately wanted control over the Shatt al-arab waterway as well as Iran's oil-rich Cruzatte Stan province the 1975 agreement was supposed to have solved this dispute but Saddam chafed under its constraints besides he only signed it to end a Kurdish rebellion supported via Iranian arms shipments his militant attitude only intensified after the 1979 Iranian Revolution which saw the rise of an Islamic theocratic government that was ideologically opposed to Saddam's secular bathurst dictatorship tensions finally boiled over into open hostility on September 22nd 1980 when the iraqi air force commenced a preemptive strike on iranian air force the following day six Iraqi ground divisions stormed the border aiming at the coos at Stan province and Shatt al-arab waterway but despite the element of surprise the Iraqi Air Assault faltered and thanks to a lack of modern bombers with most of its Air Force safe inside of hardened shelters Iranians retaliated with their own air raids on Iraq's infrastructure and armoured divisions one of these raids operation scorch soared heavily damaged the incomplete office Iraq nuclear reactor 17 kilometers were roughly 11 miles south of Baghdad despite being harried by f4 phantom jet and a age Super Cobra attack helicopters the Iraqi columns rumbled toward quorum sharp here their advance stall bogged down by intense street fighting that produced seven thousand casualties on both sides including 200 Iraqi armored vehicles although a tactical defeat for the Iranians a forty nine day battle delayed the Iraqi advance long enough for 200,000 Iranian volunteers to reach the front lines by early November the sieges of the Cuza t'stand province had set the tone for the rest of the war denied a decisive victory saddam ordered his forces to halt and consolidate their gains in december on january 5th 1981 Iran launched Operation Nasser or victory three massive tank columns smashed into the Iraqi defensive lines around the besieged city of des Ville although intended as a surprise attack the Iranian forces were spotted by observation planes as they crossed the Karka River given time to prepare the Iraqis bunker down and waited for the attack to become mired in the treacherous floodplains surrounding Susan Berg the result was a decisive Iraqi victory with between 100 to 200 Iranian tanks lost the Iraqi is lost fewer than 100 fighting vehicles however while Saddam continued to dominate on land the Iranians exploited their advantage in the skies on April 3rd a force of 8 F 4 phantoms and 4 f-14 Tomcats attacked the h3 airbase the strike occurred behind enemy and was one of the few successful stealth operations of the war by the time the smoke cleared at least 27 enemy planes had been destroyed major damage had been done to the airfield itself and the unscathed Iranians scoffed after these early operations both combatants settled into a rhythm familiar to any veteran of the great war waves of Iranian conscripts would pour themselves an Iraqi fortifications suffering hundreds of lives for a few meters of blood-soaked Sam conversely the Iraqi troops clung to their static defense like limpets their commanders unwilling to risk for wrath of their insane dictator by showing any tactical initiative thus while the Iranians suffered huge losses in each assault even minor breakthroughs quickly snowball into the encirclement of entire Iraqi divisions the stalemate was finally broken when Iranian strategists realized to be crucial flaw with operation victory with this in mind they launched operation undeniable victory in March 1982 although merely an escalation of human wave tactics the Iranians had already been employing the sheer size of the renewed assault was enough to breach the Iraqi defensive line and drive them out of the coos at Stan region fueled by little more than sheer determination the Iranian conscripts continued to advance liberating quorum char on May 24th and pushing the Iraqi military back to the border by late June sometimes a little adjective goes a long way when news reached Saddam heads began to roll anyone considered responsible for the Iraqi retreat was executed at least 300 officers and ten generals by the end of 1983 apparently too busy killing his own people to continue fighting Saddam tried suing for peace in mid-1982 however the Supreme Leader of Iran flatly rejected his proposal declaring his intent to continue the war until the Baathist regime had been replaced by an Islamic Republic this proved to be no idle threat as Iran launched Operation Ramadan on July 13th 1982 sending more than 100,000 Revolutionary Guards and militia some as young as 12 straight toward the entrenched Iraqis at first their fervor proved a match for machine guns and artillery collages but quickly filtered against the Iraqis deployed in clear violation of the Geneva Convention although it temporarily secured a 50 kilometer or 31 mile stretch of Iraqi territory operation Ramadan ultimately more than send 20,000 men to their graves alongside 400 armored vehicles the Iraqis meanwhile lost about 9,000 soldiers and at least 700 vehicles sadly for the troops caught up in this slaughter neither side was willing to compromise Iranian propaganda painted the war as a righteous jihad at a test of their nation's devotion to Allah ensuring a near endless wave of fresh soldiers to replace the hideous losses they were suffering Iraq meanwhile began receiving large supplies of war materiel from the Soviet Union and other countries allowing Saddam to continue his belligerent attitude in spite of a rising economic crisis convinced they could replicate the success of operation undeniable victory Iran continued their assaults throughout 1983 and early 1984 but out of seven major offensives only two were strategic victories on the other hand Iran still dominated the air war despite having fewer than 70 operational aircraft as human waves continued crashing impotently against the Iraqi defensive line Iranian strategists grasped the need for a new approach lacking the equipment to assault Iraqi strongholds the Iranians began probing for weaknesses along the enemy lines taking advantage of favorable terrain whenever possible such terrain was identified in the wetlands covering most of southern Iraq the region was also full of Kurdish guerrillas known as the Peshmerga who were more than willing to cooperate with the Iranians against the genocide 'el sadhana however despite training a large commando force for an amphibious assault Iran's first attack through the marshes in late February 1984 was a disaster Iraqi forces responded with mustard gas and submerged electrical cables turning whole section of marshland into inescapable death traps over 40,000 Iranian troops and 49 helicopters were lost in the assault making this one of the bloodiest battles of the war so far Iraq's economy was also starting to falter around this time Syria a supporter of Iran closed a crucial pipeline which prevented Iraqi oil from reaching tankers in the Mediterranean and consequently decreased the iraqi budget by 5 billion a month in response Saudi Arabia Kuwait and other Arab countries intervened on Iraq's behalf fearing the growing influence of Iran in the region in true Gulf state fashion their aid came in the form of 60 billion in subsidies per year Western European countries and the u.s. were sympathetic to Iraq as well and the u.s. increased support in 1982 by providing diplomatic monetary and military support including billions of dollars in loans political influence and intelligence on Iranian deployments gathered by American spy satellites meanwhile at sea Iraq began targeting Iranian shipping in order to provoke Iran into closing the vital Strait of Hormuz which would almost certainly trigger an American intervention Iran in turn retaliated by attacking Iraqi shipping and the two sides waged a tanker war for the next five years that resulted in damage to 546 commercial vessels and the deaths of 450 sailors unable to conduct offensive ground operations Saddam Hussein ordered the Iraqi Air Force to begin bombing civilian targets between 1984 to 1985 large-scale air raids racked up a civilian body count in the tens of thousands to counter these atrocities Iran developed a highly sophisticated defense network combining interceptors and surface-to-air missiles successfully the aircraft Iraq then started employing soviet-made Scud missiles and domestically manufactured under all Hussein's while notoriously inaccurate the al-hussein possessed a 1,100 two-pound high-explosive warhead and a 400 mile or 643 kilometer range making it a potent terror weapon during a seven week period in 1988 alpha Sainz killed 2,000 Iranian civilians and injured 6,000 more Russian go unanswered Iran purchased scuds from Libya and launched them against Baghdad back on the front line iran finally won a major victory in the first battle of alpha in early 1986 severing iraq's access to the Persian Gulf Saddam's forces countered by seizing the city of Moran in mid-may but the enemy recaptured it in June desperate to avoid further incursions Iraq adopted a dynamic defense strategy that enlisted the support of the entire civilian population male university students were drafted into the military in droves and civilians were ordered to clear marshlands and help construct static defenses vast quantities of foreign equipment poured into Iraq as well and Saddam was able to expand his military to 600,000 men making it the fourth largest in the world heedless of the odds being stacked against them Iran now staged a three-pronged offensive aimed at capturing the city of Basra on December 25th 1986 Iranian forces attempted to capture the island of ill Malory haces no successful a sustained sixteen thousand casualties in the process but all this was just a drop compared to the ocean of blood spilled during the main Iranian attack operation Karbala v aka the great harvest it was the largest battle of the war hitting three hundred thousand two determined Iraqi defenders against 150 to 200 thousand Iranian invaders but after weeks of assaults and an artillery bombardment that reduced most of Basra to smoking ruins the great harvest had reaped nothing more than 65,000 Iranian casualties this was the beginning of the end throughout the rest of 1987 Iran mounted no more major offensives and the rhetoric of a holy jihad began to falter in the face of war exhaustion already strained by years of warfare and economic sanctions the Iranian economy virtually collapsed under the additional weight of Iraqi missile attacks and bombing campaigns in July 1987 the UN Security Council passed resolution 598 verging a ceasefire and a return to pre-war boundaries but Saddam was far too busy preparing for future offensives to heed this call for peace and his Iranian counterpart were Hollow Kamini still believed in a divine justification for war ultimately for Kamini no amount of zeal for Allah could save the Iranian forces from defeat at the Second Battle of in mid-april of 1988 heard by their victory the Iraqis initiated operation trust in God on May 25th over the next two months Iraqi forces won a series of victories inflicting 32,000 casualties on the Iranians of sustaining only 5,000 for themselves and captured vast quantities of equipment under pressure from his advisers to end the war Khomeini grudgingly accepted the UN's proposed ceasefire on July 20th although pockets of fighting lasted until mid-august the iran-iraq war resulted in tremendous death and destruction on both sides with casualty figures ranging in the hundreds of thousands and total economic loss somewhere around 1.2 trillion dollars above all Iraqi merged from the conflict as the dominant power in the Middle East thereby embolden young Saddam to continue his expansion policy which would lead

popular and if you stay until the end of the video we'll discuss an exclusive deal Squarespace is offering to armchair historian fans who use my link below after the fall of Eva Jima on March 26 1945 the Americans counted down the days until the capture of Okinawa the last crucial stepping stone on the road to Japan located only 350 miles were 563 kilometers south of Kyushu the island offered air bases and a fleet Anchorage codenamed Operation iceberg the invasion of Okinawa would be a joint effort between the Army Navy and Marines Lieutenant General Simon Bulevar Buckner jr. was earmarked to lead the u.s. 10th army which had seven battle-hardened divisions three marine and four army and an additional 180 mm combat troops his counterpart Admiral Raymond Spruance would lead the fifth fleet which included 265 warships 119 amphibious assault vessels and over 200 auxiliary vessels although they greatly outnumbered the defenders and possessed total air superiority the Americans were by no means eager for the fight ahead even weeks after the Battle of Iwo Jima the terrifying scream of puns I still echoed in the nightmares of many GIS now they were about to face an even larger garrison preparing an elaborate network of underground defenses instead of trying to defend the entire 60 mile or 96 kilometers long island Japanese forces were to fortify the southern eighth where the terrain was hilly and irregular lieutenant general Mitsui Ujima stationed tokin forces in the central and northern portions of okinawa concentrating most of his 67,000 soldiers 9,000 naval infantry and 24,000 local conscripts behind a series of lines stretching across Okinawa since the Americans had the advantage in numbers and firepower the Japanese used the terrain to their advantage utilizing the reverse slopes making for quite Li formidable defense by April 1945 they had completed 60 miles or 96 kilometers of tunnels enough to accommodate the entire 32nd army and its weapons ammunition and provisions speaking of food the Japanese command ordered the slaughter of all the livestock on the island and decreed that soldiers and civilians alike subsist on sweet potatoes instead of rice on March 25th 1945 the US Navy began a week-long bombardment to soften up the island and support mine clearing operations the next day American forces landed on core amaretto a small archipelago west of Okinawa rooting out the Japanese there took five days but its capture provided a sheltered anchorage for ships damaged by kamikazes as for the actual invasion designated L day it was set to begin on April 1st contrary to expectations the Americans encountered virtually no opposition on the beaches in fact the Japanese were nowhere to be found by evening on L day they had captured the Yan tan and Kadena airfields and 60,000 men had made it ashore subsequently the Marines moved north while the army moved south fighting its way through several fortified outposts including one rocky spire dubbed the pinnacle meanwhile at sea the Japanese launched Operation tango on April 6th a one way suicide mission to Okinawa involving the battleship yamato and to nine smaller warships however American submarines and aircraft located them the next day and the Fifth Fleet launched a 386 plain air strike that sank the Yamato in five of her escorts an anticlimactic end for the largest battleship in history on April 8th US troops reached the kakuzu ouki line the first of a series of Japanese fortifications stretching across southern Okinawa this was where the real bloodshed began during the initial attacks the Americans often advanced straight into carefully prepared killing zones and were slaughtered on mass by concealed machine and pre-sighted mortars in response they began using artillery to keep the enemy underground before sending small units into the gaps between enemy pillboxes however this tactic was only partially effective and the Americans continued to sustain frightful losses to try to keep the enemy on the backfoot the Japanese launched night attacks on the 12th they failed due to unfamiliar terrain and flash lifeless afterwards both sides spent in week gearing up for the next round during which the Marines mopped up the resistance on the northern end of the island on April 19th the assault on the kakuzu ouki line began with a punishing bombardment by 650 planes 18 warships and 324 artillery pieces had no effect on the Japanese were safe inside their underground positions as a result fierce fighting and soon as the 62nd division used mutually supporting reverse slow positions with interlocking fields of fire to really destruction on the unsuspecting American forces inflicting heavy casualties by the 22nd however the 62nd division had been pushed back half a mile were over half a kilometre and was down to 50% strength thus the Japanese prepared to send reinforcements north despite fears that the enemy would stage an amphibious landing on the southeast coast to their relief general Buckner struck down the proposal in the end the Japanese dispatched the 24th division and 44th independent mixed Brigade no on the 23rd some units shored up the 62nd divisions along the shoreline while the rest reformed a secondary defensive line a mile or 1.6 kilometers to the south like the previous Japanese defenses that Shuri line was replete with reversed sloped fighting positions by now you should know that the reverse slope is one of our buzzwords as a result the American offensive stalled again in late April murderous small-arms fire artillery mortar fire from the high ground in the south of the island savaged u.s. infantry inflicting severe casualties every hill was crawling with Japanese soldiers and neither side hesitated to use excessive force to exterminate even squad level resistance amidst the carnage and confusion US medic Desmond dass distinguished himself by rendering invaluable aid to the wounded and carrying them back to safety he later received the Medal of Honor for his actions which inspired the blockbuster film hacksaw ridge despite the growing casualty list Buckner refused to change tactics perplexing his subordinates deniz alike meanwhile the 32nd Army Staff unanimously decided to launch an offensive on May 4th to give themselves some breathing room while it achieved some local successes the 32nd army lost 7,000 men and many artillery pieces that had moved out of their caves to support the attacks subsequently the 10th army resumed its offensive on the 11th gaining a half mile or two-thirds of a kilometer of ground by the 21st however the spring rains began on the 22nd and lasted an entire week stalling the American offensive in flag mire of mud and carry on throughout April and May the Japanese also mounted a series of mass kamikaze attacks against the US fleet on May 11th two kamikazes hit the Bunker Hill knocking her out of the war and killing or wounding almost 700 men three days later a kamikaze hit the carrier Enterprise forcing her to withdraw as well whereas the larger ships were more resilient to attack the unarmored destroyers were especially vulnerable as part of the big blue blanket an anti kamikaze tactic they were often assigned to the dangerous task of radar picket duty this meant that they invariably bore the brunt of the kamikazes by the end of the battle nearly nineteen hundred kamikazes had expended themselves against the US fleet sinking 26 ships damaging 164 others and killing 4900 sailors back on land the Shuri line was becoming untenable by late May so the Japanese drew up plans for a withdrawal in stages to the qiyan Peninsula on the night of the 24th the 60 second division pulled back from the left flank and then launched an attack on the Americans the next night meanwhile the 24th division and 44th brigade remained in their positions until the 29th and 31st respectively before withdrawing to the key online during the week-long retreat the 32nd army lost 20,000 men and vast quantities of arms and equipment to make matters worse the 30,000 survivors are not even combat troops afterward the 6th Marine Division landed on the Oroku Peninsula where it battled the Japanese for ten days meanwhile the rest of the 10th army waited until June 9th to attack the Kian line the Americans then began to chip away at the Japanese defense forcing them to commit to their few reserves On June 18th general Buckner was killed that by enemy artillery while observing his troops nonetheless his forces finally broke through the key online on

pursuing the forces of the Duke of Owl stop the Italian commander in the region little does gazelle force know that two hundred and fifty Eritrean horsemen led by Italian lieutenant Amedeo Guinea are about to burst onto the scene the galloping flu the morning mist and straight toward [Applause] [Music] [Music] hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian today's video times Italy was effective during the Second World War yeah it actually happened and more than once before we begin I want to thank our sponsor Nord VPN for making this video possible the performance of the Italians in world war ii has long been ridiculed and subjected to excessive spaghetti and pizza memes rather than objective scrutiny but it is true that overall Italy was unready for a prolonged conflict in 1940 the country had minimal industrial capacity a chronic fuel shortage and was exhausted from previous conflicts but those are topics for another video today we're focusing on the times that Italy displayed military effectiveness during the war despite the odds stacked against them speaking of which what ever happened to lieutenant Gilly a his horseman KVA and his men charged into the armored cars of ghazal force with pistols swords and hand grenades as the defenders are cut shrapnel Gilly a squadron regroups watches a second charge the gazelle artillery fires back killed confusion after a few seconds Gilead known as the devil commander disperses his squadron in the gorges surrounding character that was the last cavalry charge ever faced by the British Army while guiltier lost more than half of his unit his daring display allowed the Duke of auste to organize defenses in Agoura dot and Karen where Italians and their colonial troops would resist Commonwealth forces for two months the devil commander would go on to wage a guerrilla war against the British in East Africa and there are plenty more examples of the Italians fighting against distinctly unfavorable odds on a larger scale that are worth considering from the eastern front to the Battle of the Mediterranean to the last stand at El Alamein [Music] now let's take a look at Italy's contribution on the Eastern Front during Operation Barbarossa from September 1941 to August 1942 general giovanni messi led the 60,000 demand strong italian expeditionary Corps against the soviet union the corps was assigned to the ukrainian section of the Eastern Front their baptism by fire took place at the Battle of Petra khoka during the last week of September the 79th Infantry Regiment established a bridgehead over the river Dnieper pushing a Soviet contingent back in the process when the Germans lost to their bridgehead in nearby for nofe God the 80th Italian regiment recovered it with a bayonet charge once the Torino division pushed its enemy back general messae orchestrated a pincer movement with the help of their sanity assault units capturing 10,000 Soviet prisoners suffering a mere 300 casualties in the process the expeditionary force next saw combat during the assault on stalino Italian cavalry regiments used clever tactics to rout Soviet defenders charging only after their machine gunners had a chance to now and lay down suppressive fire with the path cleared Italian divisions prepared for their main assault on stalino on the 20th of October for surrounding towns were occupied as a pre-emptive measure to block any Soviet counter-attacks and with their flanks secured a regimen of bears a Yeti stormed stalino before breaking up into small motorized units which took the Soviets by surprise these mobile troops were supported by mounted artillery who were able to change positions quickly to avoid enemy fire while raining shelves on it's unfortunate opponents by July of 1942 the Italian expeditionary Court Russia had grown in size becoming the army er the Italian Army in Russia but increased numbers did not intimidate Soviet forces near the river Don the red army clashed with the seborrhea Cavalry Regiment the Sequoias had been surrounded by the men of the 812 Siberian infantry regiments but managed to hold them back with their howitzers when the eight hundred and twelfth started withdrawing the savoia second squadron ordered an attack this engagement became known as the charge of ice bush M spoon the last major cavalry charge in history or through the Soviet line hacking down men with sabers training them with machine guns and bombarding them with grenades meanwhile the 4th squadron had dismounted and engaged the enemy from the front while the 3rd squadron watched their own charge on the remnants of the Siberian regimen by the end of the battle the savoia regiment had lost 84 men and a hundred horses the Soviets suffered a staggering 1050 casualties the engagement took the pressure off of larger Italian units in the area granting them enough time to fortify against the offensive on the dawn however this would prove futile as in December 1942 operation Uranus and Saturn would drive the Axis forces back West [Music] now let's move somewhere a bit warmer for our next theater the Mediterranean which saw the Italian and British navies in a bitter struggle for control over indispensable supply routes cavalry charges aren't particularly effective in the water so we won't be seeing any more of those one of the key moments of this naval conflict was the raid on Alexandria this was the most spectacular success of the 10th mas flotilla the commandos of the Italian Royal Navy the operation was led by notorious Corvette captain Prince junio valerio borghese a Roman aristocrat this raid were lied on the most secretive weapons of the 10th mas the manned torpedoes these were self-propelled torpedoes on which two scuba divers could sit astride their tactic was to infiltrate enemy ports approach their ship and attach a magnetic mine to the hole on December 19 1941 borghese submarine she-ra approached the port of Alexandria and launched three manned torpedoes the raid made contact with their targets a tanker a destroyer and the British Royal Navy battleships HMS valiant and HMS Queen Elizabeth however just as they placed the explosives two of borghese's men were captured and held on the valium despite this the commandos did not reveal the nature of their mission until the last possible moment leaving the crew with no time to do anything besides abandon ship when the charges went off valiant Queen Elizabeth and the other two ships sank in the shallow waters of Alexandria overnight the Axis navies had gained strategic superiority over the central and eastern Mediterranean thanks to some Italian human torpedoes [Music] superiority in the Mediterranean was a key factor in securing supplies to the Italian and German armies in North Africa but as we know the Axis powers logistical train eventually could not keep up the theme light of the Allies who gained the upper hand in late 1942 the Second Battle of El Alamein was an access to feed the end of the beginning as Churchill described it but even in defeat the tenacity of the outnumbered outgunned Italian units allowed her win Ramos forces to invade total destruction at the start of the battle the ah dat division with the help from a badass a navy battalion and units from the padishah and forged a divisions held back Montgomery's 13th por long enough to prevent it from reaching

knocking out there exposed anti-tank guns killing 60 men and capturing 300 on the 2nd of November the 9th British armored Brigade launched another attack but lost 70 of its 94 tanks to box aad artillery fire the following day general Rommel praised the sacrifice of Italian divisions covering his withdrawal the enormous dust clouds could be seen south and southeast of headquarters where the desperate struggle of the small and inefficient Italian tanks of 20th Corps was being played out against a hundred or so British heavy tanks I was later told by major fungal that the Italians who at the time represented our strongest motorized force fought with exemplary courage the last Italian unit to fight at El Alamein was the fall gun a division of elite paratroopers this is when the Lyons truly or holding back three British divisions and one free french Brigade with little ammunition and almost no anti-tank guns befall g'day Lord the attackers into a cul-de-sac then attacked from all sides using Molotov cocktails and grenades the assault cost the Allies a hundred and twenty tanks the italians retreated slowly protecting the rear of the Africa Corps always refusing to surrender after El Alamein the folgen a continued fighting in Libya and Tunisia by the end of the North African campaign their 5,000 man strong division was reduced to a little more than 300 men in the end

       " \" hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian today's video why the Soviets got to Berlin first today's video is brought to you by the great courses plus more on that later it is spring 1945 the flowers are in bloom the sun is shining and the deadliest war in human history has entered its sixth and final year at Allied forward headquarters the supreme Allied commander of the Allied forces General Eisenhower resists the appeals of his subordinates once again after a heated argument the two storm out of the room leaving Eisenhower's mind unchanged many foresee imminent victory but he's not so sure it hadn't even been a year since the ill-fated operation Market Garden which had been stymied by a surprisingly resilient German army no he cannot justify the commitment of more manpower and equipment to the cause these men are championing [Music] by the end of the Second World War eagle-eyed spectators of world politics could sense that a new threat to global security was emerging the Soviet Union although they had fought on the same side tensions between the USSR and the u.s. quickly escalated into a rivalry that would define the rest of the century the post-war political landscape may have looked very differently if the Allies reached Berlin first so why didn't they the truth is they didn't want to they didn't even try and with that said thanks for watching [Music] okay fine there's slightly more to it than that but before we go any further let's mention a few things that do not explain why the Soviets got to Berlin first most of these misconceptions stem from the belief that underhanded political motivations were in some way shape or form the deciding factor one theory asserts that Roosevelt had secretly promised Stalin both Berlin and Prague during the conference at Yalta Eisenhower who was supposedly aware of this didn't want to commit the resources to capture a prize that would ultimately go to America's next geopolitical adversary this theory is wrong it's true that the Yalta Conference did produce a plan to divide Germany in two different occupation zones and that Berlin would be located in the Soviet zone however the Yalta Conference had also determined that the capital would in turn be divided into four occupation zones of its own you might recognize that this is exactly what happened following the war although these state of affairs didn't last very long it has also been suggested that the Westerners held back their troops in the hope that the Germans would have time to suppress leftists living in Czechoslovakia before Germany collapsed this is also wrong as a matter of fact the main source for this idea seems to be Soviet propaganda spread after the fact so if not for political reasons why did the Western Allies fail to get to Berlin first in truth it seems to have been a strategic military decision and not a universally popular one it's worth noting here that the opinions among the top Allied commanders varied drastically at this stage British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery was convinced that the European theater had been secured and that allied hegemony was inevitable he and the British command strongly favored a concentrated attack on Berlin a death blow to the Nazi government this somewhat less hubristic but equally bold George Patton believed that another large confrontation while possible could be avoided by stray quickly but Eisenhower the man who is ultimately in charge of making the decision was by far the most skeptical of all of them about such a military maneuver like we mentioned before operation Market Garden well not quite being the complete failure it's represented as in popular imagination had proven that the Vermont could still put up a staunch resistance indeed if you've seen our video about the Battle of Berlin you're probably aware that the troops garrisoning the capital were still more than capable of badly bloodying an invading force and finally the Battle of the Bulge had further stymied to the Western Allies and crushed any dreams of easily rolling through the countryside all the Vermont still had material support Eisenhower reasons that the fanatical soldiers still loyal to the Nazi regime would fight on even if the capital fell casualty projections for an assault approached 100,000 men lost in the pursuit of a dubiously valuable goal instead of investing in such a decisive and potentially very costly single thrust Eisenhower chose to keep a wide front and focus on dividing up German forces still west of Berlin most notably the roar Valley Germany's industrial heartland was still heavily defended as the Allies pushed East though German forces in this region were eventually surrounded they represented a threat that had to be neutralized if the thought of taking Berlin was to be seriously entertained by Eisenhower additionally there had been persistent rumors of a mysterious Alpine fortress in southern Germany the supposed nation already of German High Command Allied commanders were so concerned about this that they dispatched an entire army to investigate the eagle's nest or couch Steinhaus one of Hitler's many headquarters was actually located in the area of the supposed fortress but it hardly fit the bill considering the fears distaste for these small installation here it didn't even begin to approach the scale or significance that Allied intelligence have ascribed to it all of these delays meant that the Soviets had a massive head start when they crossed the Rhine in March Montgomery's beachhead was 200 to 250 miles away while Georgy Zhukov Red Army had crossed the Oder River with a million men some less than 40 miles from where Adolf Hitler was hiding the subsequent invasion of Berlin turned out to be both long and brutal but Eisenhower had no reason to think that he was better positioned none of this necessarily means that anglo-american forces couldn't have made it to Berlin in fact there were moments in mid-april when it seemed to be within reach on the 11th a US Army was just 60 miles outside the city since the German forces were so heavily concentrated towards the east his approach from the West might have actually been largely unopposed still Eisenhower denied requests to continue to Berlin his reasoning being that Hitler would simply divide his forces between the two fronts allowing the Soviets with this point were hell-bent on revenge to capture the city even sooner at the end of the day asking why the West lost the race to Berlin against the East presupposes that there was a race to begin with which is extremely debatable there was however something of a competition between Soviet generals to see who could reach the capital first for his part Eisenhower decided that a slow strategic approach was preferable whether that choice was ultimately correct is up to the armchair generals out there if you want to learn more about the race for Berlin that I highly recommend

on November 7th 1941 a great military parade was held in Moscow overseen by Stalin himself hundreds of Soviet soldiers marched through Red Square celebrating the 24th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution this year it held a special significance it was a show of defiance Stalin's desperate attempt to bolster the sinking morale of his people that defiance was cast in the face of nearly 2 million German soldiers a mere 40 kilometers away who were preparing for an all-out offensive to take Moscow and [\\xa0__\\xa0] the Soviet Union the ensuing battle was fought on a scale that was unprecedented this was total war a war of annihilation you often hear that the Soviets only won due to their numerical advantage however in this battle over a million Soviet defenders faced off against nearly two million battle-hardened German soldiers trapped in the middle of this conflict were tens of thousands of Soviet civilians some fought bravely as partisans but most were simply engaged in a desperate struggle to survive while they're relentless forces of to military juggernauts clashed around them before we discuss the events of the battle let's establish some context the German invasion of the Soviet Union codenamed Operation Barbarossa began in late June 1941 Hitler and his generals hoped to overwhelm the unprepared Soviets with the same concentrated coordinated attacks that had brought them so much success elsewhere in this way they hope to secure a speedy victory before winter arrived a phrase you've heard uttered before every failed military campaign initially though Operation Barbarossa went according to plan the invasion caught the Soviets off guard and within a month the Army Group center had driven deep into Soviet territory capturing the city of Smolensk among many others on the road to Moscow three Soviet armies were encircled and destroyed at Smolensk alone and the Russians sustained over 700,000 casualties not since the days of Napoleon had Moscow been so vulnerable to a foreign foe and if you're wondering at this point why the Soviets lost so much ground so quickly we have a video covering why Soviet performance was so poor at the beginning of the war rather than seizing the initiative and striking Moscow Hitler redirected his centre forces elsewhere toward the Ukraine in the south and Leningrad in the north while many of his generals including the commander-in-chief of the army falter Fon brauch advised carrying the invasions momentum forward to the Soviet capital emphasizing its strategic and symbolic importance Hitler was more concerned with securing his flanks and supporting the goals of army groups north and south crippling the Soviet economy by capturing Leningrad and perhaps most importantly seizing the oil fields of the Caucasus in what surely must have given the Fuehrer some sense of validation his decision did lead to short-term success as support from Army Group center our move north to advance and cut off most of the supply routes to Leningrad and armored units from Center allowed group South to fully encircle and crushed the Soviet defenders of Kiev again inflicting over 700,000 casualties following this strategic victory much of the mineral-rich Ukraine was seized and the path to the Caucasus oil fields lay open as the summer drew to a close Army Group centers flanks were secured and Hitler returned his attention to Moscow on October 2nd the ver moshed initiated their attack codenamed Operation typhoon the plan was for German forces to push eastward while separating into two pincers that would clamp down on Moscow from the north and south with the massive force the Germans were bringing to bear on the city Hitler clung to his hopes for a swift victory but those hopes were quickly dashed as the German advance was bogged down by logistical issues the continued resistance of Soviet forces and an unpredictable change in the weather the first snow came early that year on October 6 when it melted it transformed the Russian terrain into a muddy swamp like morass a phenomenon known as rasberry itza past invaders like Napoleon were stymied by wrasse butit's a-- but the German war machine was especially devastated tank treads were clogged vehicles were stuck in infantry and horses were bogged down while the mug did not [\\xa0__\\xa0] the Germans single-handedly it did certainly add to their already mounting troubles in spite of the difficult conditions the Germans pressed on battling the Soviets at the cities of Bryon's and V ESMA although the Ukrainian detour had given the Soviets time to prepare the Germans won these engagements and shrugged off Soviet counter-attacks although not without losses in particular they were harried by the arrival of newly constructed Soviet t-34 tanks which were so heavily armored that German tank guns and anti-tank guns could barely damage no German forces were victorious in every engagement along this advance they continued to take losses that they could not afford October 6 Stalin recalled his top General Georgy Zhukov from Leningrad to assume command of Moscow's defense Zhukov was one of the Soviets most skilled military leaders while he was removed from his position as chief of the General Staff in July 1941 for suggesting that Soviet forces abandoned Kiev to avoid being encircled by the Germans which as we mentioned is exactly what happened Stalin called him back to lend his expertise to Moscow's defense upon arrival on October 10th shukoff immediately said about fortifying the city conscripted a quarter million women elders and teenagers to dig trenches and build fortifications moving three million tons of Earth in the process he then set up a defensive line outside the capital stretching from Kalinin in the north to Kaluga in the south which was manned by newly raised reserve armies from the east the center of his line was the city of mosses the mosaic line slowed the invaders down rather than attack it directly the German forces split into two pincers began advancing on the north Souths this approach while slower than a frontal assault was successful and by October 27th the defensive line had fallen with the Germans advancing shukoff was forced to fall back further east in order to avoid being outflanked at this point the German advance had been severely stalled the muddy terrain continued to pose an issue fuel reserves were low and logistical issues with German supply lines prevented the effective delivery of warm clothing and other winter gear to the front on October 31st the offensive was officially halted until the supply lines could be fixed and the muddy ground was frozen even stalled the massive German army still presented a very real and terrifying threat to Moscow Metro tunnels quickly became crowded with civilians desperate to escape the impending carnage and large-scale looting plagued the city stalin had ordered the evacuation of most of the soviet government and military officials to qui be shoved on october 13th but chose to remain himself in hopes of keeping the faltering morale of his people from failing entirely in a further effort to bolster morale he chose to hold the traditional revolution day military parade on november 7th in defiance of the german army lurking outside his city this piece of morale-boosting theater was well timed as just one week later the ground finally froze we're moving to problem so the German attack resumed with only 40 kilometers where 25 miles left between them and Moscow unfortunately for the Germans with the passing of the muddy fall the brutal winter had come this year would be the coldest of the 20th century according to some weather reports although these reports vary wildly with German sources tending to report colder temperatures and the Soviets however cold it really was the Germans were certainly unprepared for it as they previously mentioned to logistical failures had left them severely lacking in winter gear frostbite gangrene and cold induced mechanical failures devastated the German army despite these horrendous conditions the army continued its attack with the northern pincer making it within 35 kilometers or 20 miles of Moscow before being repelled by a Soviet counter-attack the southern attack force fared worse failing to take or circumvent the well defended city of Tula and halting their advance there with the German attack stalled and the winter taking a brutal toll the offensive was called off and German troops pulled back on December 5th as the Germans withdrew the Soviets began a concerted counter-attack the Germans thought that these Soviets were too battered and depleted to put up a fight but the Russian reserves were more than many Germans realized by the time the German advance was called off Stalin had accumulated a reserve of over 1 million men and on the same day the Germans stopped their assault December 5th the Soviets launched their counter-offensive although they only barely outnumber to the Germans the Soviets were now far more organized and prepared than they had been at the start of the invasion and fought back with an effectiveness that surprise to the Germany's already suffering from supply shortages and the effects of the weather the Germans quickly lost ground Hitler wanted his forces to form a defensive line across the entire front however his generals in the field determined that such a defense was impossible and German forces continued to withdrawal three separate times during this retreat pockets of German forces were nearly encircled and wiped out air support provided by the Luftwaffe was instrumental in preventing a total collapse of Army Group center during this retreat by early January the Soviets had managed to push the Germans back 100 kilometers for 60 miles before stopping due to over extension and supply shortages even still the German invasion of the USSR would continue but the battle for Moscow was over [Music] while the Germans were well-armed and numerically superior the Soviets had several advantages in the Battle of Moscow that secured their victory the most prominent of these can be summed up as home-field advantage shorter supply and communication lines more plentiful manpower reserves to draw from for the purposes of fighting and setting up defenses as well as the added morale benefits associated with fighting for your homeland the Soviets took much heavier losses throughout the invasion especially in the beginning but they could replace those losses far more easily than the Germans could the long and ineffective supply lines of German forces just couldn't support the logistical demands of their massive armies and their effectiveness offered greatly as a result additionally although its role has been over exaggerated in modern times the weather was undoubtedly on the Soviet side with the rasp boot itzá bogging down the Germans until the brutal winter set in which the Soviets were far better prepared for it's certainly an exaggeration to claim that winning the Battle of Moscow would have meant a German victory on the Eastern Front it may have increased their chances but even if they had seized the capital they would have still needed to solve their logistical problems that had been plaguing them since the start of the campaign the only way that Operation Barbarossa could have ever truly succeeded was if the USSR and its inhabitants had chosen to submit but any student of history will know that submission was never

crew look up unsure of what they're hearing as the sirens echos turned to whales it drowns out the panicked shouts of the crewmen scrambling to man their stations moments later the first bombs of the Nazi invasion planned around them violently shaking the ground and coating their tank with shrapnel and dirt overcome by the smell of sulfur and burning grass they scarcely have time to recover when they hear the sound of rumbling vehicles [Music] operation barbarossa assembled the largest invasion force in history up until that point and within a month the Germans had succeeded in swallowing up a huge chunk of Soviet territory twice as big as France Hitler expected the invasion to last no more than three months but just like Stalin he would be proven wrong the slugfest that would ensue on

last time using Harry's make sure to go to harrys.com slash the armchair historian to get your trial set for three dollars will post the link in the description below now onto the video for decades after the Second World War the story of Soviet ineffectiveness in response to Nazi aggression remained largely untold as Soviet censors deliberately obfuscated documentation and suppressed first-hand accounts from the high command much of what we know now begins with the Soviet Union's lack of a truly fortified boundary between itself and Nazi Germany when eastern Poland was annexed as part of the Molotov Ribbentrop pact a Treaty of non-aggression between the Soviet Union Germany the Soviet Union dismantled its fortifications on the original border however its new border fortifications were nowhere near finished and yes while a fortified border proved to be only a slight inconvenience for the Nazi blitzkrieg in the West just ask the Allies about the Maginot Line many historians agree that the Red Army would have been much better off at the start of the war had the original borders fortifications not been dismantled and Stalin been content to sacrifice some newly gained Soviet territory to the Germans from the get-go which he ended up having to do sooner rather than later anyways part of the reason this strategy was not employed was that Stalin was under the belief that if there was going to be a war the Soviets were going to be on the offensive but one thing was for certain Stalin was not ready for an offensive or defensive war on paper the Red Army could field nearly 24,000 tanks however less than 30% were combat ready most were also obsolete light tanks such as the t26 and Beattie with only about 500 kV and 1,000 t-34 models available additionally Soviet forces having few radios relied on signal flags in contrast to the Germans who had radios installed in just about every vehicle this disparity in communications technology severely compromised Soviet command ability their maintenance programs were also haphazard and shoddy the best tanks frequently lacking the replacement parts necessary to last more than a single engagement it didn't help that the Russian road network which was almost entirely unpaved proved inadequate for the movement of men tanks and supplies to the front consequently Soviet armoured formations were often restricted by shortages mission support vehicles spare parts and fuel the Germans meanwhile could only filled about 3600 tanks the most common being the Panzer 3 on paper it was inferior to the Soviet t-34 and kv-1 in the realms of firepower and armor but the Panzer 3 had superior ergonomics optics vision devices and a dedicated gunner as a result the tank had three times the rate of fire of the t-34 whose commander had the extra responsibility of handling the gun however one can't exclusively rely upon statistics regarding armored gun size and speed to determine the ability of a tank that is unless you're playing war thunder to properly see the disadvantages the Soviets faced one must look at the way the tanks were employed and to talk about just that my friend and fellow youtuber potential history will be joining us hi Griffin the key difference in their approach to armored warfare was the implementation of a successful combined-arms doctrine the Soviets while believing in this military concept which they referred to as deep battle dr. and liked the experience to properly implement it as a direct result of the Great Purge see the Red Army campaign in Poland or the beginning of the winter war before the Red Army advance got bogged down for an example of this they had this down in concept but lacked the coordination that they needed to achieve it successfully and a proper combined arms maneuver the Germans on the other hand were very familiar with this and had first-hand experience implementing it correctly so much so that contemporary historians now refer to their interpretation as blitzkrieg although they never used the word the proper term that they used is bhave goose creek German military planners eventually discovered the advantages the t-34 and kv-1 three indirect engagements as rare as they were and sought to minimize any such encounters instead German armor is used to exploit weaknesses in enemy lines and cause shock and most importantly they worked hand in hand with Luftwaffe in the infantry the speed at which the German tanks were able to travel was advantageous at first but eventually became problematic there are many instances during Operation Barbarossa of German infantry their equipment loaded onto horse-drawn carts being left behind while Panzer formations moved up to 18 miles per day this was logistical II unstable and soon the Germans would be in the same situation the Soviets were by the end of the year thanks for stopping by and if you want to learn more about the situation on the Eastern Front by the end of 1941 head over to potential history's channel for a video on just that the Soviet air force wasn't in much better shape eighty percent of the Soviet aircraft were near obsolete on the eve of Operation Barbarossa and only the yak-1 and lagg-3 could be considered modern although they were still inferior to the German me-109 F Soviet pilots were under trained and inexperienced as well between January and March of 1941 the average pilot had roughly 12 hours of flight experience while only 15% had been trained for nighttime fighting an even smaller percentage had experienced flying at higher altitudes which German bombers were regularly operating in initially German bombers were highly effective due to Stalin's standby orders which meant Soviet aircraft were parked in tightly packed formations which left them or to airstrikes the Germans destroyed at least 1200 Soviet aircraft at 60 air bases within hours of operation Barbarossa's commencement leaving the Luftwaffe free to assault Soviet Armour almost unopposed in the early phases of the war a hallmark of any authoritarian regime is the systematic eradication of those deemed a threat to the regime survival Joseph Stalin's purges subjected tens of thousands to the horrors of the gulags of siberia and the military was not immune to these efforts no one really was truth be told Stalin was a keen student of history and he often reminded his colleagues that the French Revolution was followed by a military coup d'etat orchestrated by Napoleon Bonaparte to combat this threat Stalin initiated a cleansing of the Red Army hoping to quell any leaders daring enough to challenge his power in no short order three deputies of the People's Commissar of Defense 16 military district commanders five fleet commanders 33 corps commanders 76 Divisional Commanders 40 brigade commanders and 291 regimental commanders were removed violently or otherwise in the interwar years after stalin assumed power between june 1937 and 2 november 1938 35,000 Red Army officers experienced the purges firsthand after losing so many of its most experienced and capable officers the Red Army was left demoralized and lacking effective leadership Stalin was a major factor in the Soviet Union's ineffective response at 8 a.m. on June 21st 1941 he received reports that a German deserter had crossed the border informing Soviet command that the Germans would strike early on June 22nd Soviet High Command promptly informed troop commanders at the front to be on the lookout for any unspecified provocation here's the problem in the event of a German incursion Stalin issued orders to Soviet commanders to not yield to any instigation in an effort to prevent big [\\xa0__\\xa0] this order in essence immobilized Soviet armed forces at the start of Operation Barbarossa contributing to a haphazard retreat and a poorly coordinated counter-offensive the German deserters warning proved hauntingly accurate at 3:45 a.m. on June 22nd Stalin received an urgent call from one of his top generals Georgy Zhukov he nervously reported that the Luftwaffe had started bombing several major Western Soviet cities all shook off could hear on the other line was Stalin's breathing did you understand what I said asked the general still no response from Stalin when shukoff asked for permission to open fire Stalin said permission not granted this is a German provocation as late as the Soviet abandonment of Brest a week later Stalin still insisted that his troops not retaliate hoping to avoid war [Music] now let's examine the Red Army's tactical and strategic failures in the early phases of the war these failures were a natural consequence of the after mentioned Army purges and lack of directive from the top of the Soviet hierarchy and can therefore at least partly be laid at the feet of Stalin despite the bravery and ferocity of Red Army soldiers they were systematically decimated or encircled and captured in many engagements in the weeks and months after Operation Barbarossa Slon CH within a single week German forces advanced 200 miles into Soviet territory and killed captured or wounded some 600,000 Red Army troops there encircling tactics created vast pockets of Soviet forces cut off from the rest of the Red Army contributing to the high number of Soviet POWs for example the encirclement of Soviet forces near Kiev in September 1941 led to roughly four hundred and fifty three thousand Soviet troops surrendering while another pocket near Moscow a month later resulted in five hundred and fourteen thousand captured Red Army soldiers in all almost 2.4 million Soviet troops were taken prisoner by the end of 1941 and most of these men would not live to see their homes again as for tactics Soviet military leaders generally clung to wrong ideas about mechanized and infantry based warfare Stalin for example wanted tanks and armored vehicles evenly dispersed throughout units on the front as this would theoretically strengthen each unit although to be fair many contemporary military theorists subscribe to this belief the Germans on the other hand simply masked their Panzers together creating an armored spearhead that broke through Soviet defenses with relative ease after Stalin's Pyrrhic victory against the Finns in 1940 the Soviets did take steps to reorganize their tanks in such a manner but they were not able to follow through with these plans before the commencement of Operation Barbarossa as for infantry tactics Soviet officers had a tendency to resort to assaults while this contributed to the Red Army's reputation as being fiercely dedicated and relentless in combat the emphasis on frontal assaults racked up the body count ultimately combined arms warfare effective German and circling tactics and questionable strategies employed by Soviet officers and high command post Stalin's Great Purge contributed to the scores of Red Army troops being killed or captured in the beginning of the German invasion by the winter of 1941 the situation had turned dire for the Soviet Union Nazi forces were at the gates of Moscow and simultaneously besieging Leningrad and Sevastopol in his moment of triumph however Hitler overplayed his hand the combination of poorly maintained supply lines and the infamous Russian winter ground German progress to a screeching halt ultimately giving Stalin valuable time to rebuild and retrain his armed forces the Red Army's unexpected turnaround certainly deserves further elucidation so if you would like us to make a video on the Soviet Union's effectiveness in the later stages of the war let us know in the comments below [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] not so fast mr. Hitler [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter]\",\n",

French against the Viet Minh independence fighters with the Viet Minh closing in on final victory in late 1953 the French established a base at Dien Bien Phu in a last-ditch attempt to lure the Viet Minh into a climactic battle yet their strategy backfired and the Vietnamese general vu and zap known as the red Napoleon inflicted a crushing defeat on the French the Battle of Dien Bien Phu shifted the balance of power in Indochina and laid the groundwork for America's full-scale entry into the Vietnam War ten years later here to give you some speedy context to French colonialism in Southeast Asia is friend of the channel blue from overly sarcastic productions hi Griffin French colonialism in Indochina dates back to 1858 during the reign of Emperor Napoleon the third and colonial Indochina grew to encompass modern Vietnam and Cambodia by 1887 French colonists used Indochina as an export base for tea rice and even rubber and forced much of the local population into poverty and crushing work to meet that demand clamor for self-rule really started to gain momentum in 1930 with the foundation of the Indo Chinese Communist Party by Ho Chi Minh a decade later forces under Imperial Japan invaded all of Indochina and occupied it throughout the Second World War in response to these foreign occupiers Ho Chi Minh founded the Viet Minh an independence movement whose forces successfully harassed the Japanese with guerrilla actions after Japan's surrender and withdrawal hochiminh declared independence from France and formed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on September 2nd 1945 thanks so much for letting me stop by thanks blue be sure to check out his video on the history of the French Empire after this video despite Ho Chi Minh's proclamation of independence French troops returned to Cochin China the next month to decide the future of Indochina French and Vietnamese delegations convened in Fontainebleau a year later but negotiations reached a stalemate November 23rd 1946 the situation escalated when a Haiphong incident took place in which a French Cruiser bombarded the city of Haiphong killing approximately 6,000 civilians this clash paved the way for the Battle of Hanoi which marked the beginning of the eight-year long first Indochina war by late 1953 the situation for the French was becoming increasingly dire the Viet Minh had seized most of the countryside as well as the northern part of Vietnam and were poised to threaten Laos next to regain the initiative General enry Navarre the supreme commander of French forces in Indochina decided to construct a fortress at DNP m Phu a remote village in northwest Vietnam with a strategic airfield from which the French could lure the Viet Minh into a decisive battle and annihilate them using superior airpower and artillery however the more aggressive General Kony head of the northern theater was skeptical of the idea since he wanted to use the NBN Phu as a launching pad for raids into enemy territory in the end Navarre overruled him and proceeded with Operation Cast or an airborne landing champion fool on the morning of November 20th 1953 French paratroopers hit the ground despite encountering some resistance they secured the Valley Center by mid-afternoon and engineers soon arrived to repair the airstrip a week later two high-ranking French officers planted the commander of the entire operation Colonel Christie old Lucas tree and the commander of the paratroopers Colonel Pierre log lay over the next three months the garrison launched a number of reconnaissance missions into the jungle at the express order of Kony which accomplished little and sapped its strength preoccupied with forays the garrison was too exhausted to properly fortify DnB and foo meanwhile the Viet Minh had occupied the hills surrounding Gambian Phu by early February and started shelling the valley with artillery that they had disassembled and laborious Lee moved up 500 miles through the jungle the guns were reassembled in the hills and camouflaged to protect them from French patrols air power and counterbattery fire some of the Viet Minh batteries were even placed in underground positions so that only the barrel of the gun was visible in contrast the French artillery was set up in the open making them easy targets despite repeated attempts the French eventually lost the battle for the homes any hope of victory by mid March 1954 the makeshift French defenses were completed interestingly these strong points were supposedly named after du Castries former mistresses and three of them Gabrielle Beatrice and Isabelle were outside the main perimeter do you know how they say not to bring up your ex-girlfriends on the first date I think the same rule applies in warfare Beatrice was at the heart of the defense as its function was to counter vietminh bombardment it would not be long before its effectiveness was put to the test the French garrison numbered 13,500 men in total these included paratroopers Foreign Legion Ares and colonial troops from the Maghreb and members of the Vietnamese Thai minority Zapf marshaled an army 49,500 strong with 15,000 to 30,000 support personnel additionally he had greater than a three to one advantage in artillery both combatants benefited from the support of powerful allies the Chinese provided Zapp with artillery pieces and military advisors while the US at one point paid up to 80% of the French war offer the Eisenhower administration had also been secretly supplying the garrison with military aircraft disguised as civilian planes indeed American pilots flew many of the DND and fuel supply lines on the afternoon of March 13th the viet minh began bombarding beatrice scoring a direct hit on the command bunker and killing several key officers this was followed by an infantry attack which the defenders resisted fiercely oh it was in vain however after midnight the stronghold had fallen and hundreds of French soldiers lay dead along with even more dead Viet Minh colonel de Castries decided not to mount a counter-attack to retake the vital beatriz preferring instead to reinforce catriel which he believed was the next most likely target this prediction was correct and the next evening gabrielle was hit by heavy fire followed by yet another massed infantry attack the French resisted tenaciously for the whole night but the next morning the survivors were forced to withdraw to Ann Marie and who get it was during the defense of Gabrielle that Lieutenant Colonel Shara Pierrot committed suicide a colleague who saw him shortly before recalled him saying I am completely dishonored I have guaranteed to cast wreaths at the enemy artillery couldn't touch us but now we're going to lose the battle I'm leaving during the last week of March de Castries became increasingly withdrawn in his quarters and was effectively replaced as commander by long delay the situation deteriorated even further when Viet Minh anti-aircraft guns shot down two c-47 transport planes on the 26 nonetheless the French refused to withdraw from the five main strongholds as they continued to receive some reinforcements and supplies via parachute drops Zapp's attacks continued until April 10th concentrated on who get these frontal attacks were costly both for the defenders and the attackers the Viet Minh had lost over 10,000 men consequently Zapp changed his strategy instead of committing men to frontal attacks the Viet Minh would begin digging trenches and tunnels around the perimeter of Dien Bien Phu to grind down their enemies from afar and slowly constrict them on April 14th Zapp's men finally captured the airstrip since it had already been out of commission the French simply continued to be resupplied through air drops but these two were made increasingly difficult by amount of the amenity aircraft weapons and as a result supplies in the enforcement's often landed behind enemy lines during April the US had been contemplating a direct intervention in support of the French it was called Operation vulture it would have involved sending 98 b-29 bombers and 450 jet fighters to attack the vmn although different versions of the plan existed Secretary of State John doles even proposed using tactical nukes however President Eisenhower vetoed the operation on May 1st Zapp unleashed his final attack under heavy rainfall and captured for minor strongholds in four days nonetheless the situation for the French began to look less desperate about five days later when the rain ceased friendly planes flew more sorties than ever before and transports dropped almost 200 tons worth of supplies on May 6 this good fortune would halt the same day when the attackers deployed their new weapon Soviet made Katyusha rocket launchers supplied to them by the Chinese the rockets tore through the French trenches and bunkers severely damaging their morale before the French had a chance to recover zop ordered an infantry assault on a Leone which had already withstood repeated attacks since April initially the French repelled the Viet Minh but ultimately the hill was lost after about ten hours of intense combat at this point stronghold Isabelle had been completely cut off and had lost almost all of its howitzers to a heavy bombardment the siege finally ended on May 7th due to the loss of Ellie on Lucas tree decided to negotiate a ceasefire however Kanye who had been listening to the Garrison's death throes broadcasted his final orders over the radio from Hanoi he will fight to the end there is no question about raising the white flag over D an bein Phu after your heroic resistance at the end of 6:30 p.m. the Viet Minh entered the bunker and captured two kastri ten minutes later the red flag replaced the tricolor outside around this time DM BM Foose and its last radio message were blowing up everything odd you the ambien through represented the end of France's ambitions in Indochina zaps victory proved inspirational to independence movements elsewhere most notably in French Algeria the French suffered 9000 losses of whom 7,000 were captured while the Viet Minh lost 8,000 killed and 15,000 wounded a day after the battle ended the French Vietnamese lashings and Cambodians began discussing the future of Indochina at what would become known as the Geneva Conference under public pressure the new government of Prime Minister mon des france pulled out of the region laos and cambodia gained their independence and Vietnam was divided along the 17th parallel into a northern communist state and a southern Democratic state at the endian Phu the French made the mistake of under estimating the Vietnamese one that the Americans would be doomed to repeat a decade later [Music] [Music] meanwhile in an alternate timeline it's almost over after years of fighting and so many lives lost vietnamese liberation is near the French are on their last legs finish them off attack we are almost out of ammunition and we are terribly outnumbered we better surrender before we are all slaughtered well if there isn't any aid coming wait do you hear that is that Oh No\",\n",
       " \" I'm very pleased to announce that today's video is sponsored by the great courses plus more on that later hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian today's video the Seven Years War a war that actually spanned for nine years and was the first large-scale globe spanning conflict in history preceding the first world war by over a century and a half [Music] in our first video on the Seven Years War we're going to be covering the period from 1754 to 17 the conflict buckle in as our journey will take us from the wilderness of North America to the Mediterranean Sea and down to the tip of India in the evening of July 3rd 1754 a 22 year old leftenant colonel in the British militia sat inside a hastily constructed palisade ill-advisedly located at the bottom of a valley about 50 miles outside of modern-day Pittsburgh the Lieutenant Colonel had been handed a demand of surrender written in a language that he did not speak he signed it without realizing that he had just confessed his guilt in the assassination of Joseph du zum vinden an enemy officer killed five weeks earlier in a small skirmish in the contested Ohio Valley that spring in the early morning of July 4th he and his troops marched shamefully back from whence they came Juma views death and the humiliating defeat at Fort Necessity would ultimately steal both French and British resolve for a war that would engulf five continents for his part the young Virginian officer seemed to develop a taste for conflict despite the embarrassment of his first and only surrender his name was George Washington and he remarked in a letter to his brother I have heard bullets whistle and believe me there was something charming in the sound war had still technically not been declared yet following Washington's failed venture into the Ohio Valley General Edward Braddock was dispatched early the following year to show the future American president how a British gentlemen conducted himself in battle not well as it turns out Braddock led a force of more than 2,000 into the valley that spring he never made it to the French position of Fort Duquesne despite outnumbering the French and Native American garrison two-to-one meanwhile at sea Britain began fully exercising her naval power boarding and capturing hundreds of French merchant ships on July 9th 1755 just over a year after Washington's defeat Braddock's forces wandered into an ambush in which enemy soldiers fired down on them from the tree lines above losing nearly 1,000 men Braddock himself was mortally wounded in the excursion before we continue it is worth noting that American Indian troops played a major role in most of the battles in North America they more often supported the French but different tribes fought on each side in particular the Ojibwe tribe Wabanaki Confederacy Ottawa Shawnee Lenape and Huron tribes sided with the French the Iroquois Confederacy Catawba Indian nation and Mohican tribe sided with the British lastly the Cherokee Nation would fight against both countries at one point or another one of the few times that the British did manage to get the upper hand in America was when militia troops from Nova Scotia crossed the Mesa GWACs River into French Canada on June 16th Massachusetts militia led by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Moncton took control of Fort beauséjour a French position meant to project power throughout Acadia once he secured control of the area the British began what historian Fred Anderson has called possibly the first time in modern history that a civilian population was forcibly removed as a security risk this mass deportation called LeGrande de hajima ultimately resulted in the displacement of 11,500 people many of whom eventually died of disease or due to shipwrecks [Music] 17:56 saw great britain and france finally declare war on each other two years after the shooting started why reason number one is because it was the convention colonial powers typically let their subjects wage colonial wars without going to war themselves however to get the full answer will need to travel back to europe in 1748 this year saw the conclusion of the war of the austrian succession through the signing of the Treaty of ex la Chapelle which saw Maria Teresa retained the Habsburg throne and most of Europe's borders remaining stagnant with the exception of Prussia's acquisition of the resource-rich Silesia the somewhat inconclusive outcome to the war meant that an Austrian attempt to retake the territory was almost guaranteed in preparation for the war that he knew was coming Frederick the Great of Prussia began laying the groundwork to avoid being outnumbered by Austria's potential allies namely Russia he once wrote of all of our neighbors Russia is the most dangerous those who come after me will be well advised to cultivate those barbarians for they could ruin Prussia without fear of reprisal Frederick's fears were realized as in 1746 Austria and Russia signed a defensive alliance to try to circumvent that issue he made an alliance with Great Britain in January of 1756 in the convention of Westminster despite the country's treaty obligations to the Russian Empire Frederick also didn't bother resigning his pre-existing alliance with France because he assumed that the French would remain opposed to Austria regardless the Madame du Pompidou the court mistress of Louie the 15th who despised Frederick had the Kings ear Frederick assumed that she would urge Louie to stay out of war she did not France reluctantly signed the first Treaty of Versailles just four months later aligning themselves with the Austrians and Russians thanks to the cunning Austrian diplomat Wenzel Anton in a turn of events that should be familiar to those who have studied the first world war a tangle of alliances called the diplomatic revolution intended to preserve peace would eminently lead to the vicious outbreak of war the colonial struggle between Britain and France finally made its way to Europe when the French captured the British fort Saint Philippe on the island of Menorca in June this escalation mostly brought on by Britain's naval raids on French commerce was the primary reason for the declaration of war King George ii found of his holdings in Hanover knew the French would come after it soon she attempted to bring the Dutch into the war but they were indifferent to the cause realizing that a larger war was inevitable Frederick seized on what he saw as his only hope a preemptive strike on Saxony a sizeable Holy Roman Imperial state beginning in August in order to protect his flank he left some of his forces in East Prussia and Silesia to defend against attacks via Russia and Austria respectively Frederick had hoped to sweep through Saxony forcibly conscripted their army and appropriating their treasury before moving through bohemia and moravia to march on vienna but the Saxons put up a bitter fight at Dresden and Poorna and when the Saxon King finally did surrender in October it came at the expense of much more time and many more Prussian lives than Frederick had anticipated by the time he had made his winter headquarters the Austrians had successfully invaded and occupied the southern portion of Silesia things were going somewhat poorly for Frederick and to be British we're having difficulties in North America to losing fort bull and for William Henry before we go any further I'd like to call attention to William Pitt the British prime minister as of July 1756 his strategy to defeating the superior French army was to engage it on his terms he avoided mainland France to focus instead on its lesser defended colonies however the German state of Hanover under the same crown as Great Britain had to be protected so Pitts plan was twofold instead of pouring money into an out matched land army Pitt invested resources into supporting his Prussian allies whose ground forces had the capability to stand up to Frances primary force with Britain's European possessions protected pick could initiate the second part of his plan by opening up additional fronts across the globe in order to overextend the French in a war of attrition as he was confident that France could not contend with Britain's Navy with this plan in mind the following year saw the opening of a third theater of war as conflict broke out between the British and French East India Company's both European states were vying to fill the power vacuum left by the ailing Mughal Empire this theater called the third Carnatic war began with some smaller skirmishes in the south an inciting incident had taken place in the previous summer in Bengal where several British soldiers were imprisoned in the infamous black hole prison by the local ruler for three days with only a few surviving this was a factor leading to the first major battle which occurred when the British forces commanded by the renowned Colonel Robert Clive rested control of the French aligned Ben Gaul in the Battle of see in late June during this battle the British were outnumbered roughly 16 to 1 with no cavalry but we're still able to achieve victory this is partially due to a sudden rainfall that ruined the powder of the Indian Army believing the British also lost their powder which they had evidently kept safe the Indians too launched a cavalry charge only to be blown away by the British artillery in Europe Frederick had spent the spring cutting a bloody swath through Bohemia and eventually besieging Prague Austria's count Leopold fog down led a relief force that dislodges the embattled Prussian King at the Battle of Killeen in June that defeat as well as reports of a Russian invasion in East Prussia forced Frederick to turn back Russians arena Elizabeth's men had taken mammal but had been unable to go further due to the element that stops any force in Eastern Europe logistics meanwhile the French had launched an assault on Hanover against a British led army the French achieved victory in the Battle of Hostin Bek outnumbering their foes by 25,000 this resulted in a peace treaty between the French and Hanover in September called the convention of costed Savin needless to say this wasn't something Frederick was all too happy about at this point the last thing Frederick needed was yet another enemy and you know what he got another enemy Sweden smelled blood and invaded Pomerania that summer the British and Prussians were now severely outnumbered despite the odds stacked against him Frederick won two decisive battles in November and December first he defeated the French at the Battle of Rostov on November 5th and then a month later he routed the Austrians at the Battle of Lloyd despite being heavily outnumbered Frederick always considered lightin to be his greatest achievement but it did not change the fact that he was still fighting an uphill battle Maria Theresa's husband Francis the first successfully rallied many of these smaller German principalities against Prussia as Austria and France began their full-scale invasions meanwhile george ii disavowed the convention of clustered saven and Hanna re-entered the war command was given to Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick who was able to lead the forces of Hanover to victory against the French in the spring he drove them across the Rhine and kept Prussia's western borders secure for the rest of the conflict in North America the French continued to rack up wins against the British including the infamous defeat at Fort William Henry in August in which almost the entire British garrison 2,500 troops was captured this state of affairs changed in 1758 with the British finally seeing some success in this theater though the French held on to Fort carrion and with it most of the Hutt's Valley the British were able to capture Louie boar in Canada and fort duquesne that troublesome French position in Pennsylvania that started all of this Duquesne was renamed Fort Pitt roughly located in today's downtown Pittsburgh in India most of the British forces were tied up in Bengal that left an opening for the remaining French and their allies to attack fort Saint David and the city of Madras they successfully captured the fort however heavy monsoon rains and poor preparation costs them precious time during their advance on the city by the time they began their siege it was December and the British were preparing for a counter-attack after a month of fighting and siege work six British ships loaded with men supplies and gums breached the blockade forcing the French to withdraw back in Europe Frederick spent the early months of 1758 attempting and then aborting another incursion into Moravia meanwhile the Russians re-entered East Prussia which they would hold on to for the next four years the Russians did not advance much farther due to supply line limitations that led to shortages in ammunition and food in August Frederick made an attempt to expel Elizabeth's troops at the Battle of torn dwarf with 42,000 men the Russians outnumbered Frederick by nearly 6,000 with both sides taking heavy casualties the bloody battle ended in conclusively the final major event of the European theater this year came in October after Frederick misread his adversaries in tension this time in the saxon village of hawker count found out whom frederick had fought with the year before had a reputation as an overly cautious commander who never attacked unless he had perfect positioning and visibility since colleen frederick had repeatedly failed to goad fawn down into battle and began to believe that the austrian commander would never make his move but as the church bell struck five o'clock in the morning on October 14th 80,000 Austrian soldiers began their attack while the Prussians were still sleeping in their tents fighting in the streets of the town was brutal but the battle only lasted five hours despite putting up a good fight Frederick's 35,000 men could not hope to fend off the vastly superior Austrian force for long at 10:15 the Prussians were in full retreat leaving behind almost all of their artillery and around 90 400 men dead were captured nearly a third of their army the battle could have been a death blow if found down had chosen to press his advantage instead the count reaffirmed his supremely cautious reputation choosing not to pursue this gave Frederick's forces all the time they needed to lick their wounds and come back with a vengeance a 1758 came to a close the 18th century's world war was in full swing even though the Anglo prussian alliance was being beaten back on all fronts the two powers were far from defeating the expenditure of blood and treasure would last for another five years and caused upheaval the world over more on this unprecedented conflict next time in the Seven Years War part two in our last video you saw how colonial skirmishes and diplomatic twists started to the 18th century's very own world war in this video we'll be discussing one more diplomatic reversal that managed to completely change the course of history before we get to that let's start off today's video with a completely unnecessary excuse for me to play with the reverb settings on my microphone it's 1758 and in one corner we have France Russia and Austria who have been stopping the competition in Central Europe and in the other we have the anglo-russian alliance in serious need of a cut Minh but considering the fact that today the United States official language is not French you may have guessed that things turned around for the British and Prussians you'd be right but it didn't happen immediately [Music] Frederick had just suffered the greatest military disaster of his career after a string of defeats at ke and Maxim on the fields of Kerner's Dorf a name that would haunt Frederick's memory forever Prussian forces attempted an ambitious double and development hoping to overwhelm the Austrian and Russian armies massed near the oder river but Frederick had used this tactic a variation of the oblique order before and his enemies were ready for it the Russians had heavily weighed their forces in the center and were able to dispatch reinforcements with east wherever the Prussians attacked the battle marks the only time forces under Frederick himself broke order and retreated in total disarray Frederick's allies meanwhile enjoyed a reversal of fortune after successfully defeating the French in Madras India British forces won a series of victories all over the globe in a turn of events that should be thoroughly unsurprising to anyone who's ever read up on British history they began to utterly dominate the war at sea the Royal Navy was victorious at Guadeloupe Lagos and kiba on bay decisively extinguishing any threat of French invasion on the British mainland the ground forces in North America complemented these maritime triumphs after capturing the newly christened Fort Pitt the previous year British regular and colonial forces spent that spring securing their hold of the western frontier with victories at Fort Niagara and Fort carrion which gave them control of the Hudson Valley with that front secured it was time to move north all summer British forces under General James Wolfe lay siege to Quebec leading to the Battle of the plains of Abraham on September 13th yet another British success however wolf would not live to see his officers march through the streets as both he and the French commander Louise Joseph de Montcalm were killed in the fighting as 1759 drew to a close British supremacy abroad had been confirmed and they were well on their way to supplanting France as the premier global power the following year 1760 proved equally auspicious for the British on the battlefield but also saw the death of their king george ii died on October 25th possibly on the toilet that fact is not particularly important but the writer threatened to quit if we cut that from the script anyways he was succeeded by his grandson George the third who would oversee further victories around the globe in India where the British had actually been fighting the French and Indians Britain scored a decisive victory at the Battle of Wandy wash in January despite being outnumbered by 2,000 they then launched a renewed offensive and by September the French army and their remaining allies were trapped in their colonial capital at Pondicherry during the grueling three-month siege that followed civilians died in droves by early next year the French garrison surrendered and the British were victorious in India in North America the Redcoats and their colonial allies seized on the momentum that they had gained through the capture of Quebec to win several more easy victories that summer throughout the course of the war French support among Native American tribes operating in Ohio and Canada had steadily eroded the Shawnee and Lenape had made a separate peace with Britain in 1758 while many of these so-called Mission Indians those who had converted to Catholicism continued to fight up through 1760 at which point they too abandoned the war effort though some sporadic fighting did continue that year essentially meant the end of French Canada and the last major conflict in the theatre unsurprisingly Native Americans both who had aided French and British allies ultimately got the short end of the stick but more on that later so how were things going for Frederick in Central Europe this year I think solidly mediocre would be a reasonable way to describe this situation the Swedes took control of a significant swathe of Pomerania in January while the French took Marburg and the Austrians captured the Silesian city of Klotz that last defeat was especially damaging to Frederick's pride because the Austrian commander Aaron Stephane Loudon had once sought employment in his army but was rebuffed Frederick quickly struck back at him though defeating the Austrian forces at Leibnitz in August the following month brought an utterly humiliating defeat when Russian and Austrian troops captured and held Berlin from October 9th to the 12th despite the rather short occupation it was still a terrible blow to Prussia morale in keeping with the trend of Frederick winning battles while losing the war he ended the year with a success at the Battle of torgul one that came at a heavy price a third of his troops as New Year's Day 1761 came and went the Seven Years War had seemingly contracted and appeared to be making a decisive end India and North America were no longer the sites of large-scale warfare and the British Empire had established supremacy in both theaters in Central Europe however the walls were closing in on Frederick [Music] Prussians and Hanoverians looked West to try to stymie the French but in doing so left kohlberg open to a Russian assault in December Elizabeth's forces took the city Russia's final port on the Baltic Sea creating a two-fold problem for the besieged Frederick Russia's greatest weakness it's chronic supply problems had just been resolved and Prussia's access to British naval assistance was curtailed not that the Brits were feeling especially helpful in fact the newly crowned George the 3rd was significantly less committed to supporting the Prussian cause than his predecessor had been George the 3rd immediately suspended financial aid to the beleaguered German state likely as the first step towards suing for peace after all the British had won in the corners of the world where they had fought so why should it be their problem if their Ally couldn't pull its own weight by now things were looking grim er than ever for the Prussians exact numbers are hard to find but by the years ends the maximum number of troops he had at his disposal was probably around sixty thousand who were up against hundreds of thousands of the combined French Austrian Russian and Swedish armies the hour was late and the enemies were at the door it was a foregone conclusion that Berlin would soon be under siege his only hope it seemed to him was the Ottomans it was a bit of a long shot to say the least but Frederick had been making diplomatic overtures to the Sultan for years and he thought that maybe just maybe they would start to bear fruit they ultimately didn't join but more than enough happened early in the year for things to remain interesting 1762 saw two new powers entering the war a full eight years after the conflict broke out in North America Spain's new king charles the third hope to capitalise on the weakness of Portugal still recovering from the disastrous 1755 Lisbon earthquake since Britain was most likely to challenge them in that regard and had important economic and diplomatic ties to Portugal he was quite receptive to French support to join the war the French in return hoped that the British would either have to divert troops to defend their allies or lose in a source of material and financial support perhaps alleviating some of the pressure from their most powerful adversary on January 4th war between Britain and Spain had begun the conflict was marked by three failed invasions of Portugal by Spanish and French troops throughout the year each one repulsed by the Lusitania pnes and their British allies a number of troops were mobilised in Brazil as well and the neighbouring Spanish colonies in South America but actual battlefield casualties were very rare and deaths were almost exclusively a result of disease as if this turn wasn't stunning enough Empress Elisabeth of Russia died exactly a day after the war in the peninsula broke out leaving Russia's commitment to the war effort in doubt as it turned out Elizabeth's successor Peter the 3rd was something of a frederick fanboy and almost immediately sued for peace despite Russia's highly advantageous position frederick anxious to end hostilities promptly offered East Prussia to the Russians but much to the entirety of Europe surprise Peter refused all he wanted was to be given the order of the black eagle a chivalric honor awarded by the Prussian government presumably with a bewildered shrug frederick agreed and Peter placed most of the Russian troops under Frederick's command who joined the Prussians in the field by June 1762 Sweden which had only really entered the war opportunistically simply said nope and backed out of the war meanwhile Frederick took this opportunity to reinvent Elisha but the new Russo Prussian Alliance did not last long as Peter was deposed and killed in a coup organized by his own wife and Frederick's distant cousin Catherine the second in July having successfully gameofthrones her husband the newly widowed Empress withdrew her armies from Central Europe probably because the plot twists were becoming too unbelievable before they left however they did help contribute to one more Prussian victory at Berger's Dorf where frederick allegedly bribed the russian commander to stay put for a little while the austrians underfund down assumed the Prussians had more fresh troops available and retreated handing a victory france's crushing defeats in India North America and Portugal as well as Austria's in Silesia had fatally drained both countries Treasuries seeing Austrian prospects for the reconquest of Silesia disappear and suffering under a brutal British blockade Louis soon sued for peace the Austrians were not far behind the official peace treaties would not be signed until the next year but for all intents and purposes the Seven Years War was over [Music] the first of two documents that ended the war was the Treaty of Paris no not that one nope nope nope yep that's the one signatories of this treaty included Great Britain France and Spain with Portugal being expressly included under the terms of the treaty certain possessions that had been captured during the war like the many sugar rich Caribbean islands and part of the African colony of Senegal were returned to their original owners nonetheless in terms of territory Britain was the biggest winner France renounced all claims in India made since 1749 they also gave Britain all territory in North America east of the Mississippi except New Orleans that was given to Spain as compensation for Florida which had in turn also been ceded to Great Britain speaking of North America as we already mentioned the Native Americans living in eastern Canada and the Ohio Valley now had to deal almost exclusively with the British some like the Mi'kmaq sand certain members of the Iroquois Confederacy felt compelled to ally with them with many eventually fighting on the British side during the American Revolution before eventually aligning with the British many Native American tribes made war with their new Imperial overlords reigning in Ohio in Pontiacs rebellion which started in 1763 hoping to stern the violence George the 3rd issued the royal proclamation of 1763 later that year thereby forbidding the settlement of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains the colonists who had just fought a war in part to take said land from the French promptly ignored it in Central Europe Prussia Austria and Saxony signed the treaty of Hubertus Berg five days after the Treaty of Paris bringing an official end to the Silesian theater of war the terms of peace returned clots to Prussia and reconfirmed its control over Silesia in return for the prussian evacuation of saxony the war in this theater had proven that frederick was an exceptional battlefield commander and pressure was a force to be reckoned with but it also demonstrated it would need strong allies in any future conflict Austria and Russia meanwhile had proven themselves competent military powers that could keep up with Western Europe's finest a truly global conflict arguably the first of its kind the Seven Years War had a profound impact on the world Britain's supremacy in both North America and India was solidified while France began a precipitous decline we didn't talk much about the conflict in West Africa since it was mostly confined to small British expeditions against wealthy French colonies but it does emphasize how far-reaching the war was battles fought on four continents placed an enormous logistical and financial strain on all of the powers involved the economic woes that ensued are widely seen as a major cause for both the American and French Revolutions the year 1763 may have been the end of the Seven Years War but its outcome would reverberate down these centuries and shape the world as we live in today if you want to learn more about the Seven Years War then I highly

Helena was remote unpleasantly humid and perpetually damp here a man who had once conquered a continent and terrified the world was stuck in the deteriorating Longwood house a far cry from the palaces he once resided in he spent days reading writing about the great heroes he admired and sharing tales of his fascinating life with the throngs of visitors that made the journey to see him many afternoons were spent brooding about the 18th of June 1815 day that he the first emperor of the French was beaten one final time [Applause] [Music] [Music] on a handful of ridges near Brussels the hundred days period came to a close and to the seventh coalition was victorious Napoleon's fleeting restoration ended just four days later and with it his dream of ruling France but could this disastrous failure have been avoided or was his fate sealed before the first shots were even fired and today's historical analysis we're looking at whether or not Napoleon could have won at Waterloo impossible is reward to be found only in the dictionary of fools [Music] after doing the impossible and bloodlessly reassuming power napoleon was already back on the offensive having just won a strategic victory at cuatro bra against the british and what would be his final victory at Ligny against the Prussians he was on the move toward the site that would reverberate in his mind forever Waterloo the reinvigorated Grand Army that Napoleon mustered consisted of about 72,000 men 14,000 of whom were cavalry unsurprisingly given his fondness of artillery Napoleon fielded an impressive 250 cannon a full 60% more than the British the coalition army under Arthur Wellesley the first Duke of Wellington consisted of 68,000 men about 11,000 of which were cavalry and 150 cannon finally the Prussians under GERD von blücher arrived later in the battle and had a total of 48 thousand men about 7,000 of whom were cavalry and approximately 130 for cannon on paper Napoleon held a clear advantage he had more men who were generally better trained and who more experienced than their opponents and more firepower furthermore as Wellington himself said while eating breakfast during the morning of the battle Napoleon's presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 men but while Napoleon's troops were of higher quality his officer corps left much to be desired a serious brain drain among the higher ranks affected the French forces at Waterloo and many officers were assigned command of unfamiliar units upon arrival to the battle even the best soldiers are ineffective when they lack direction so how did things shake out well you guys know had it not been for the desertion of a traitor I should have unhit lated the enemy at the opening of the campaign I should have destroyed him Malini if my left had done its duty I should have destroyed him again our Waterloo if my right had not failed me before the battle began the Duke of Wellington went to work fortifying the position where he would meet the French using the reverse slopes just outside the town of Waterloo he was able to conceal many of his troops while fortifying three major defensible positions these included the Chateau Hyuga mall to the west and the Papillon farm to the east which he intended to garrison as an anchor on either flank in the center lay LaHaye sankt farmhouse and an adjacent sandpit if all went as planned Napoleon's flanks would be vulnerable no matter which position they attacked despite this Geographic disadvantage the Emperor of the French believed that victory was assured however the most dangerous threat to Napoleon was the proximity of the Prussian troops who helped to bolster Wellington's eastern flank in order to delay their arrival napoleon dispatched marshal emmanuel duke russia with approximately 34,000 men nearly 1/3 of his total strength to harass them thereby buying himself enough time to face one enemy at a time the decision was not a bad one but a torrential rainstorm on the 17th delayed the French response Napoleon consequently postponed the attack until midday on the 18th as to give the ground the time to dry perhaps miss calculating how long it would take the Prussians to arrive when the battle properly began around noon the French infantry began their feint attack on huge amol an important communications hub what should have been nearly the opening stroke before an assault on the enemy center became a brutal as Napoleon sent leave after wave of men against the chateau the British garrison held fast without drawing a significant number of reinforcements from the centre furthermore hiding behind the reverse slopes made Wellington troops all but involve all two artillery fire though he had more men and perhaps could have overwhelmed the British eventually time was not on Napoleon side around 1:00 p.m. a massive troops appeared in the distance finally grew she was arriving oh wait that's the Prussians Napoleon's worst fear had now materialized he would have to move fast or risk being overwhelmed a dispatch was quickly sent to Russia ordering him to return to the main army but he never did for disputed reasons his initial orders had been to pursue the Prussians and keep them at bay battling the third Corps in the afternoon the loyal general was following his Emperor's orders to the letter well not quite to the letter he failed miserably to pin the Prussians down it was his only job he was too busy fighting a small contingent while the rest of blue-cheese horses bore down on the increasingly beleaguered french army their arrival to the battlefield was slow however and Napoleon with his unwavering sense of optimism still believed today his optimism wasn't entirely ill-founded after two brigades of British heavy cavalry among them the infamously Cavalier Scots greys attacked the French they were then caught in a counter-attack by the French Kuras ears and Lancers the Scots greys were essentially destroyed as a results along with many of the other regiments to me to Perdition forgets to hinder the prussian advance Napoleon set up a cavalry screen supported by a corps of infantry he then shifted his attention from Hyuga mall to the Allied centre at LaHaye st. - brigades of infantry under the audacious marshal Michel ney attacked the farmhouse but were repeatedly repulsed when he mistakenly believed that he saw a break in the British line ney ordered a massive cavalry charge three divisions of French cavalry smashed into the eye in front as a result of mais carelessness straight into anti cavalry square [Applause] by 6:00 p.m. these mounted units have been completely depleted but a 6,000 yen infantry advanced managed to secure the position after heavy fighting from their hard-fought position French artillery chewed through the Allied center devastating Wellington's command post and for a moment it seems that victory was within Napoleon's grasp so long as nay could get some reinforcements from the Imperial Guard held in reserve but Napoleon refused to give up the forces he was using to secure his flank against the Russians who had been advancing while ney launched one more wasteful cavalry attack after the next with more Prussians arriving and the French flank finally collapsing utterly demoralized after the young guard had been beaten back the Emperor was forced to deploy his old guard a card that should have been played much earlier by then even the old guard consisting of France's finest troops seasoned veterans of numerous campaigns could not turn the tide they would rather die than surrender by 9:00 p.m. it was all over four days later Napoleon abdicated the imperial throne the hundred days were at an end [Music] in 1815 i relinquished the anticipation of ultimate success i lost my first confidence perhaps I found that I was wearing beyond the time of life I which fortune usually proves favourable or perhaps dispelled that I hung over my miracle Asturia was broken now that we've summarized the course of this historic battle it's time to return to our original question was its outcome avoidable first let me step out of my armchair historian roll and get ready for some armchair general ship much better there's a handful of moments in the battle that are easy to point to as potentially fatal mistakes nay and Grucci are often targets for blame and have gotten their share of it over the years Russia was undeniably outplayed by the Prussians and if he had more effectively delayed them or had been able to respond more rapidly to the order recalling him to the battlefield of Waterloo events may have transpired differently as for ney his numerous attacks on the British line were unnecessarily costly he through repeated cavalry charges against the British infantry while they were in square formation although the French displayed true heroism during these charges they may as well have been falling on their own swords an earlier combined-arms attack that employed artillery and cavalry more effectively may have gone a long way the possible permutations here especially if we take earlier battles in the campaign into account are nearly endless and there's plenty of blame to go around historian Adams Amoy ski in his biography Napoleon a life suggests at la petit Caporal might have just lost his touch he says the younger Napoleon would have tied Wellington down head-on and outflanked him pinning him in a trap of his own making then a point of old probably also would have been willing to dispatch the old guard to help secure naze position on the case ain't and he might have not devoted so much manpower to attacking Hyuga mon which although an important position was not worth the price paid Napoleon has also been criticized for needlessly waiting for the ground to dry before attacking the British but the trade-off would of course be delayed movement of mounted and artillery units these strategic blunders were compounded on a tactical level by the decision to organize many of the men into closed columns which despite demoralizing the enemy did not constitute the most effective option for maximizing firepower I'm told Bonaparte gave two reasons for his failure Grucci failing and checking the Prussians and his great charge of cavalry being made half an hour too soon to us at the armchair historian Napoleon could very well have won at Waterloo if he had prioritized breaking the British centre line rather than wasting lives on taking human the Imperial Guard should have been deployed as early as possible to reinforce an attack on the British center in addition ney should have never been given free rein to deplete the French cavalry division's in Russia we've talked enough about Russia joining me now is Cody from alternate history hub to talk a bit about how Napoleon could have achieved victory on a strategic level it seems to me that the best way Napoleon could have fended off the 7th coalition was to avoid embarking on the Waterloo campaign entirely upon Napoleon's return it was immediately clear that a new coalition would form and resist him with the same tenaciousness as before he could have fought defensively given himself time to recreate the army he had fielded in his first reign at the cost of public support although its offensive strategy more in line with the six days campaign which took place just one year prior may have been better suited to repelling the 7th coalition winning this war would likely be the greatest challenge of Napoleon's life regardless of whether he stood a chance or not defensively or otherwise the emperor opted for a much more aggressive course of action now known the history as the Waterloo campaign it is ironic that given how much of his success on and off the battlefield was the result of bold maneuvering Napoleon's final display of audaciousness in pursuing this strategy may have been the one to doom him yet on the day of the battle itself that bold decisiveness seemed to have been absent Napoleon could have won the Battle of Waterloo but probably not the Napoleon who is present the man who lost to Wellington that day bore more resemblance to the one who would die on st. Helena in 1821 and the one coronated in 1804 you\",\n",

hundreds of burning oil wells the shattered remnants of the iraqi army make their way north along highway 80 toward basra vehicles of all kinds from tanks to technicals clog the road forcing swarms of

like a bird of prey after those are iraqi vehicles proceed to engage over only now do they realize they may not have truly escaped safely firing [Music] before we continue let's turn the clock back seven months on august 2nd 1990 iraqi forces acting under the direction of president saddam hussein cross the border into kuwait you might be asking yourself why saddam invaded such a seemingly trivial country the answer lies mostly in saddam's own poor decisions namely the protracted iran-iraq war which had exhausted iraq's economy and forced the country to take out billions of dollars worth of loans from kuwait and saudi arabia unable to repay saddam asked kuwait to forgive the death they refused to exacerbate matters kuwait was exporting more oil than it was allowed to as a member of opec the organization of petroleum exporting countries by june of 1990 the price per barrel had plunged to around 17. costing iraq billions of dollars in oil revenue around this time iraq also publicly accused kuwait of illegally drilling under the border and siphoning oil from them predictably kuwait and the foreign firms working in the area dismissed the claims this alleged theft of iraqi oil was a major catalyst at least officially for the invasion that occurred one year later in addition to the aforementioned oil dispute saddam also invoked iraq's traditional territorial claim to kuwait arguing that the country was merely a product of british imperialism in 1922 british high commissioner of mesopotamia sir percy cox had unilaterally set the boundaries between iraq kuwait and saudi arabia and in the process he gave away most of iraq's coastline although iraq was unhappy with this arrangement the issue of kuwaiti sovereignty lay largely dormant until the start of the gulf war with all of these grievances it was only a matter of time before war broke out for his invasion saddam mobilized a hundred thousand of his best troops in contrast the kuwait army consisted of only 16 000 soldiers and many were on leave at the time of the attack the element of surprise ensured that effective kuwaiti resistance ended within just 12 hours after which saddam triumphantly proclaimed that kuwait was now the 19th province of iraq although his army was in good shape and could have easily continued into saudi arabia and seized its valuable oil fields saddam abruptly gave the order to halt for now conquering kuwait was enough as he had shown the rest of the world that iraq had become the preeminent power in the middle east nonetheless iraq was not the preeminent power in the world and it wouldn't be long before the major powers intervened on behalf of kuwait and saudi arabia in anticipation of this saddam employed as many as 600 000 soldiers to iraq's southern border over a period of six months within the same time frame the american-led coalition assembled nearly 1 million personnel on the other side of the saudi border as part of what was called operation desert shield during the preparation phase the iraqis decided on a strategy of protraction seeking to turn the upcoming showdown into another vietnam they would prolong the conflict to turn the american public against the war and dictate the decision-making process of president george h.w bush's administration [Music] from a military standpoint the iraqis grossly underestimated the advances in technology since the vietnam war and did not consider that many of their soviet-made tanks most notably the t-72 were obsolete against the vastly superior american m1 abrams even worse they failed to correctly predict the nature of the war according to norman cigar a research fellow at the marine corps university saddam assumed that much of the fighting would occur at close range so the coalition advantage in long-range weapons optics and electronics would not matter meanwhile there was a mass exodus from densely populated areas as ordinary iraqis raced to escape the impending hostilities yet as late as january 16th 1991 there were still people lingering in baghdad for those that remained life continued with some semblance of normalcy even if it was plagued with an uncomfortable tension pulitzer prize-winning author rick atkinson describes the situation in baghdad on the eve of war say for an occasional vendor peddling oranges and dates baghdad's soups or bazaars lay empty shops which in recent months have been overflowing with spoils of war from rolex watches to armani shoes were now shuttered and padmocked that night january 16th 1991 the coalition launched a massive air campaign marking the start of operation desert storm the bombardment was directed at both tactical targets such as radar stations and strategic targets such as infrastructure and electricity surrounded by the explosions of bombs and missiles and with the nation's air defense systems completely worthless against the coalition's overwhelming air power the residents of baghdad steeled themselves for what would be the most trying period of their lives up until that point over the next six weeks iraq's infrastructure and military were devastated paving the way for an eventual ground campaign by mid-february baghdad was in disarray according to atkinson the war had reduced the city to 19th century probation basic services like running water electricity telephone service and garbage collection were no longer functioning and gasoline was in short supply in short the air campaign profoundly affected the quality of life in the nation's capital on february 24th 1991 the coalition launched the ground phase of operation desert storm which consisted of a two-pronged assault into kuwait and southeastern iraq outgunned and outmaneuvered iraqi opposition rapidly folded during their advance the coalition took huge numbers of iraqis prisoner most of them were young men who had been drafted into the military by the 26 only two days into the ground offensive coalition forces had broken 26 of 43 iraqi divisions in kuwait knocked off balance by the speed of the coalition's advance the iraqis activated their contingency plan which involved withdrawing from kuwait and destroying as much infrastructure as they possibly could in the process as they retreated iraqi forces torched over 600 oil wells some of which continued to burn for months however before untold thousands of iraqis could completely withdraw the coalition managed to cut off a portion of their retreat it didn't help that there was a bottleneck on the main road specifically highway 80 leading out of kuwait city gained the nickname of the highway of death because of the sheer numbers of vehicles destroyed by coalition aircraft on the night of the 26th the death toll is estimated to be around one thousand with approximately two thousand captured however up to eighty thousand iraqi soldiers may have escaped the trap at this point only a handful of saddam's elite republican guard divisions stood between coalition forces and complete victory and in spite of their much-wanted fighting ability they were no match for the fast-moving american armored columns on february 27th american forces destroyed over 150 iraqi tanks and armored vehicles in the battle of 73 eastern at the cost of only one bradley infantry fighting vehicle that same day american and british units destroyed 1 000 iraqi vehicles at the battles of norfolk and medina ridge although president bush announced a ceasefire on february 28th sporadic fighting continued for another week specifically near the ramila oil field iraqi forces offered token resistance as coalition forces swiftly closed in around this time iraq decided to sue for peace on march 3rd 1991 six weeks into operation desert storm the two sides met at sofwan iraq where they formally agreed to a ceasefire all told iraq suffered 20 000 killed 75 000 wounded and 80 000 captured during the gulf war in contrast kuwait experienced 16 000 casualties and coalition losses were just over a thousand many of which were surprisingly due to friendly fire the war did not oust saddam's regime it was feared that carrying the attack to baghdad would have made america look like the aggressor and the united nations council only enforced an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait and imposed economic sanctions on saddam's government moreover the u.s wanted iraq to have enough military capacity to quash kurdish and shia uprisings which could have been detrimental to its allies in the region like turkey and the gulf states indeed when rebellions broke out in iraq after the end of hostilities the us did not intervene to thank god for the longevity of his regime saddam commissioned the creation of the blood quran supposedly it was written with 27 liters of his own blood possibly more to correct spelling mistakes whatever the case saddam was sanguine about his prospects despite the crippling economic sanctions and infrastructural damage sustained as a result of the war ultimately saddam defied the western powers and their allies for 12 years after the end of the gulf war until another american-led coalition finally toppled his regime in 2003 now i want to thank

the brilliant pyrotechnics display continues the marine wonders if anything can survive the firepower of that magnitude and fears anything that might [Music] by 1944 American forces had penetrated Japan's outer line of defense in the Pacific and were working their way towards the inner line following the capture of the Marianas in August the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided that the next target would be the island of Iwo Jima capturing it would give the American b-29 fleet bombing Japan emergency landing strips but even more importantly the island could be used as a staging area for the anticipated invasion of Japan in March of 1944 even before the loss of the Marianas the Japanese had begun fortifying yo Jima the commander of the islands garrison Lieutenant General Ted Ameche Kuribayashi was similarly aware that an American victory at Iwo Jima was inevitable nonetheless he resolved to make their victory as costly as possible defiantly proclaiming we are here to defend this island to the limit of our strength if our positions are overrun we will take bombs and grenades and throw ourselves under the tanks to destroy them long live the Emperor [Music] knowing the vulnerability of conventional Shore fortifications Cory bye ashie prepared a layered defense consisting of strong mutually supporting positions additionally he ordered the construction of a complex system of caves bunkers and tunnels these subterranean installations ranged in size from small dugouts intended to accommodate a squad of men to huge caverns capable of holding a battalion and were virtually impervious to any form of bombardment the Japanese were vastly outnumbered and outgunned and this required them to be especially resourceful in their usage of heavy weapons namely their 23 type 95 tanks and 70 anti-tank guns which they placed in well fortified positions after almost a year of preparation the Japanese garrison had grown to 21,000 men and more than 19,000 yards of tunnel had been excavated during the planning of his defense Kuribayashi had also developed an innovative battle plan which would allow the Americans to land unopposed when they had advanced about 550 yards inland the Japanese would deliver concentrated fire from automatic weapons and artillery positions across the island unlike curry by ahsha's tactics the American invasion plan was conventional and straightforward overseen by Fleet Admiral Chester W Nimitz capturing the island was the responsibility of the 80,000 strong v amphibious Corps commanded by Major General Harry Schmidt and consisting of the third fourth and fifth Marine divisions the fourth and fifth divisions would land side-by-side on the eastern beaches with the fourth on the right and the fifth on the left then they would pivot right in advance toward the northern end of U wajima simultaneously a regiment from the 5th Marines would capture Mount Suribachi meanwhile the third would stay in reserve to soften up the island general Schmidt requested a 10-day naval bombardment however he only received three if all went well for the Americans they would capture the island quickly but as the old adage goes no plan survives contact with the enemy and especially not this enemy at 859 a.m. on February 19th 1945 the first wave of Marines waded ashore in accordance with Kuribayashi plan the Japanese held their fire leading submarines to mistakenly think that the bombardment had destroyed them over the next hour more men and materiel landed on the beach until it was crowded shortly after 10:00 a.m. the island exploded into fire and chaos Derek Wright author of Iwo Jima 1945 states that everything from machine guns and mortars to heavy artillery opened up on the beach quickly transforming it into a nightmarish bloodbath pinned down by this murderous fire the Marines frantically entrench themselves in the soft volcanic ash which provided rudimentary cover the ash was slippery and difficult to traverse and so they can only inch their way forward until the Seabees also known as the naval construction battalions bulldozed makeshift roads through the sand even after reaching the Japanese defenses the task of securing them was complicated by quarry by 'she's tunnel network which allowed the garrison to reoccupy their positions even after the Marines had cleared them by 11:30 a.m. a contingent had reached airfield number one in the interior of iwo jima while another group of Marines cut across the narrowest part of the island reaching the opposite shore however the 25th Marine Regiment of the 4th Marine Division encountered heavy opposition on the right flank near a strong point dubbed the quarry right notes that of the nine hundred men that landed in the morning only a hundred and fifty were left in fighting condition by nightfall a staggering eighty-three point three percent casualty rate the land battle was not even a day old and already it was becoming an exceptionally vicious fight nonetheless some thirty thousand Marines managed to land by dark and thousands more would eventually be committed to battle over the next week they slowly advanced inland capturing one of the islands airfields and establishing a foothold on the other since firearms were not very useful at flushing out fortified enemy positions the Marines resorted to using flamethrowers and grenades to replace units that had sustained high casualties elements of the third Marine Division were pulled from the rear and thrown into the fight [Music] general Kuribayashi had expressly forbidden any Banzai charges deeming them futile instead the Japanese employed guerrilla and infiltration tactics in order to chip away at the Americans and prevent them from operating safely because of this more passive approach Japanese casualties remained relatively low and morale remained relatively high First Lieutenant Sugihara kenryu kept a meticulous diary during the early stages of the battle and on February 22nd he wrote this is a winning battle be persistent we must definitely build the foundation of victory for this Greater East Asia war by February 23rd the Marines had isolated mouths Suribachi and small groups of men began making their way toward the summit although the mountain was still largely occupied by the Japanese most chose to stay in the tunnel network where they were eventually killed as a result resistance was relatively light during the ascent after reaching the summit they planted an American flag the first to fly on Japanese soil observing from a ship offshore marine Alvin øresund recounted that the top brass told us it would be all over in 72 hours sure enough at 10:35 a.m. on the 23rd we saw Old Glory being raised on the highest point now Suribachi that's it we thought we've done it in spite of this triumphant sentiment the fighting was far from over there were still thousands of Japanese soldiers entrenched on the northern half of the island none of whom were likely to surrender between February 25th and March 10th the Marines fought their way through fierce resistance taking nearly 12,000 casualties in the process on the left flank the 5th division attacked a series of ridges and Hills concurrently the third advanced in the center and on the right flank the fourth stormed a part of the island they called the meat-grinder with the Americans closing in one japanese commander launched a final Banzai attack on the evening of March 8th 800 Japanese soldiers charged the American lines although it was deemed to futility the Japanese still managed to inflict 347 casualties at the cost of 784 dead as the battle entered mid-march the Marines closed in on the North and southeast corners of the island however before the island could be completely secured about 300 Japanese soldiers scattered around the islands many tunnels gathered near airfield number two and launched a sneak attack on the night of March 25th allegedly led by curry by Oishi himself they surprised the Americans camping in the area bayoneting some of them in their sleep hand-to-hand fighting lasted for 90 minutes before they were finally wiped out after 36 days of fighting the island was declared secure on the morning of March 26 but victory and iwo jima came at a steep price the United States sustained more than 28,000 casualties which accounted for a third of all suffered by the Marines in the Second World War the Japanese on the other hand lost essentially their entire 21,000 man garrison the battle over this small seemingly insignificant island was one of the costliest in American history and consequently has generated a large and enduring controversy over its strategic value if you're like me and spend a huge chunk of

have besieged the city since their failed coup attempt two years ago slowly starving the inhabitants into submission the grueling siege would last another five months [Music] [Music] the Spanish Civil War perhaps best to known as a proxy conflict between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union gave the world an early look at the type of war that would be waged on a global scale only a few years later in the early decades of the 20th century communist and fascist groups surged in popularity competing for nothing less than total domination on the international stage in the Spanish Civil War these two

[Music] the cow do we spoke of earlier was none other than Francisco Franco an avowed monarchist in the days of the Spanish Republic Franco went on to take over the country and pursue neutrality as the world descended into war remaining in power up until his death in 1975 but how did he go from military commander of a small colonial garrison to the totalitarian leader of all of Spain the civil war in Spain represented the culmination of a period of inept leadership in increasing polarization in the country as the financial gap widened between the wealthy often devoutly Catholic elements of the country and middle-class workers both groups were increasingly drawn to political extremist ideas and rhetoric including monarchism fascism communism and militant anarchism to name a few the Austrian miners strike in 1934 served as a grim prologue to the conflict to come the labor uprising had begun in opposition to the rise of the Catholic conservative political party the spanish confederation of autonomous rights were SATA which socialist union leaders believed held dictatorial ambitions and to be quite honest they weren't completely wrong he'll rob lace the leader of seda and admirer of the German Nazi Party had declared that democracy is not an end but a means to the conquest of the new state when the time comes either Parliament submits or we will eliminate it troops under the then Major General Franco brutally crushed the labor uprising giving him a reputation for merciless pragmatism political enemies and a growing loyalty among the rank and file sure enough he'll rub laces words were more than just rhetoric [Music] Ceyda narrowly lost the 1936 Spanish general election to a left-wing coalition called the Popular Front unsatisfied with the result a far-right military faction co-led by Franco launched a coup d'etat on July 17th of that year the Nationalists as they called themselves Pope to overwhelm the newly elected Popular Front government before the Republican loyalists had time to react however their initial efforts were only partially successful just four days after the coup began nationalists had control of Spanish Morocco the Canary Islands and most of the Balearic Islands on the mainland they controlled much of the territory north of the guadarrama Mountains in most other areas forces loyal to the Nationalists were not influential enough to mount a proper attempt at insurrection but come August the Nationalists made rapid progress by swiftly thrusting through Western Spain as part of what was essentially a peninsular blitzkrieg troops from the army of Africa led the advance ultimately paving the way for Franco's ascension to supreme commander of the nationalist forces in October attempts to take the capital repeatedly failed but further peripheral offensives in 1937 secured Malaga in the South and the industrial enriched autonomous regions in the north in contrast the main Republican assault that year on Zaragoza was a complete disaster due to poor reconnaissance and a lack of coordinate during the attempt to take the fortified town of Fuentes del a brawl Republican troops rode into battle on the holes of Soviet supply dt-5 tanks but suffered heavy casualties after the battle an American volunteer row courage and heroism are plentiful in Spain and the Spanish people have no lack of it what they need is tactics and as for tactics on 13 October regiment Beattie was bankrupt 1938 proved to be one of if not the most intense year of the conflict with the Nationalists achieving a crucial victory during their spring Aragon offensive slicing the Republican zone in two moreover the failed Republican attempt at reuniting their territories in the Battle of abro the largest of the war drained Republican military power to its breaking point 1939 saw Catalonia easily subdued by Franco and that same year the war was over [Music] the civil war in Spain was certainly not an unbroken string of Francoist victories but the Nationalists almost always have the upper hand but why was that the case well first off the uniquely high nationalist troop quality in comparison to the Republican foe is of great importance the nationalist advance in August 1938 which secured its territorial integrity for the rest of the war was only made possible by its most elite formation the army of Africa composed of both Spanish colonial troops and North African regularise it was led by a cadre of well-trained and highly professional officers called African East us the army of Africa advanced ruthlessly securing vast swathes of agriculturally rich territories for the nationalist cause opposed only by hastily armed peasants and were commissioned by early 1937 they had increased in size to around 60,000 troops from a measly 1,500 during their initial deployment the year before both the local African and Spanish soldiers of the army of Africa possessed a professionalism that was matched only by their capacity for viciousness they repeatedly committed atrocities against both soldiers and civilians in areas they conquered due to their infamous reputation nationalist commanders would place them in the most dangerous positions along the front to intimidate Republican forces but it wasn't brute force alone that allowed nationalist forces to triumph at this time much of Spain's land was devoted to traditional agriculture and controlled by a small group of aristocrats during the Civil War these land owning conservative elites almost unanimously sided with the rebellious nationalists this gave the Nationalists a decisive logistical advantage in a radio address Franco proclaimed that the Battle of wheat as he called it was as important as or even more so than those at the front food became such an alluring motif that nationalist propaganda directed at often omission Republican soldiers almost always emphasized the full stomachs of Franco truce so how exactly did nationalist administrators acquire such a well-regulated food supply during such a devastating war while the Republicans failed to do so as it turns out the Nationalists partial coup in 1936 was more successful than it initially seemed capturing the agriculturally rich regions of Andalusia and Castile meant that by 1937 the Nationalists possessed twice the wheat reserves of their adversaries furthermore the military regime employed an ethos of pragmatic productivism to ensure output was high granting incentives to effective producers of grain meat and other essential foodstuffs regardless of ideological concerns perhaps most importantly nationalist military administrators were ordered not to disrupt communities under nationalist control a proactive effort was made to ensure that the population was kept fed and potential enemies kept suppressed this efficient management led to a relative continuity of normal life for local populations in contrast to the relative order behind Franco's lines the Republic under its president Manuel azaña was almost perpetually in a state of internal division with its many factions squabbling with one another the most notable of these civil wars within a civil war is known as the may days of 1937 which broke out in Catalonia and pitted Republicans against far left anarchist and socialist factions this strike resulted in roughly a thousand dead and 1,500 wounded now I'd like to introduce my friend Hilbert from history with Hilbert to talk a bit about the foreign intervention in the war superior domestic military units were a key determinant in the nationalist victory but foreign military aid was just as vital despite the signing of a non-intervention pact in August of 1936 the fascist governments of Germany and Italy and the dick toriel regime in Portugal continue to aid Francoist Spain critically these allies also assisted in transporting the army of Africa across the Strait of Gibraltar as well as sending combat aircraft and armoured vehicle reinforcements around 350 tanks and a thousand 260 aircraft notably the condor legion a german volunteer formation compromising air and ground forces proved highly effective in maintaining air superiority in many battles and is perhaps most notorious for its participation in the leveling of the basque city of Guernica an event many at the time and to this day rightfully cease a war crime well novel for 1937 the targeted mass bombing of a civilian area became a staple German tactic during the Second World War in order to psychologically force an enemy population to submit while on a smaller scale new tank tactics were trial that would form the basis of the famous blitzkrieg in Europe if you want to find out more about how the Spanish Civil War influenced the Second World War then head over to my channel history with Hilbert and give it a watch as for the Republican government they were for the most part on their own no democracy was bold enough to risk escalating the conflict so the task fell to the Communists the Soviet Union sent up to approximately three hundred and sixty tanks and eight hundred planes unlike their nationalist counterparts however the Republicans had to pay for a lot of these goods during the war it should be noted that despite the neutrality of many democratic governments many sympathetic citizens of those nations did volunteer in what was known as the International Brigades however they did not prove particularly effective we can therefore conclude that by almost all measures the foreign support that the Nationalists received was far more robust altogether loyal and professional military units order behind the lines and a pragmatically organized authoritarian economy and food supply as well as extensive foreign backing created the conditions that led to nationalist victory in 1939 the ripple effects produced by the Spanish Civil War on the country it was fought in cannot be overstated widespread economic destruction and deaths to other countries took the nation decades to recover from and recent estimates indicate that around 500,000 people died during the war out of a population comprising only 25 million some put the number of as high as two million little wonder why Spain stayed neutral during the Second World War today the Spanish people still feel the cultural echoes of their civil war on a wider scale the Spanish Civil War served as a macabre testing ground for Germany Italy and the Soviet Union tactics and technologies that were to be employed with great effect in the coming Second World War were perfected on the fields and streets of Spain from Wescoe to Madrid [Music] [Music] you\",\n",
       " \" today's video is brought to you by squarespace the easy-to-use all-in-one platform for building your website hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian today's video the second congo war [Music] the second congo war has been called africa's great war and according to reuters news it is the deadliest conflict since the second world war although the death toll is still the subject of vigorous debate what makes this subject difficult to cover is that as of this video's release the conflict is still arguably going on depending on how we differentiate different wars despite that fact we'll do our very best to explain who's fighting who and why before we begin i'd like to let you know we've got a discord server up we'd love to have you join the link is in the description below the first thing that we need to address here is that the conflict was fought along both ethnic and national lines like we've mentioned before on this channel postcolonialism has been messy to say the least as it turns out when you draw national borders without any regard to pre-existing cultural identity you tend to create countries full of people that well don't get along too nicely the most important transnational force in our story is the tutsis a loosely defined socio-ethnic group that have historically lived throughout the african great lakes region most prominent in burundi and rwanda they've long dominated the more populous hutus in the same area why is that relevant because in 1994 the hutus perpetrated a large-scale genocide mostly in rwanda inadvertently creating a tutsi diaspora we're going to come back to the tutsis but for now just remember that a great many members of this historically powerful group were dispersed all over the region the second bit of backstory here is the first congo war which is arguably the same conflict as the second congo war in 1997 laurent kabila who led the alliance of democratic forces for the liberation of congo zaire overthrew mabutu seisei seiko the military dictator of the democratic republic of congo or later renamed the republic of zaire kabila accomplished this with military backing from nearby nations particularly uganda and rwanda the latter of which at this point was once again controlled by a tutsi dominated government rwanda's motivation for removing mobutu was to stymie cross-border raids by various guerilla groups including some hutu extremists considering how small rwanda's territory is these raids essentially brought remnants of the previous hutu government uncomfortably close to the capital uganda had similar concerns about the allied democratic forces a sudanese-backed group that engaged in cross-border violence and kidnapping and yes the allied democratic forces is a different group from the alliance of democratic forces many of kabila's soldiers were congolese tutsis so they had a vested interest in creating a secure state that could defend their kinsmen with the help of these and a few other outside factions the afdl were able to take control of the country in may 1997 marking the end of what is usually considered the first congo war unfortunately for everyone involved the piece lasted for only about a year one of kabila's first discoveries as the new leader of the democratic republic of the congo was that it's a whole lot easier to invite military allies over for dinner than to ask them to go home his government was awash with foreign military advisors and many congolese citizens began to wonder if their president was just a puppet of those who had put him in power meanwhile those who had put him in power were really wishing they had a better puppet kabila was unable to stem the tide of guerrilla fighters raiding uganda and rwanda and in fact tacitly supported them his hope was that by disassociating himself from the tutsis that had put him into power he might be able to establish a more reliable political base well he succeeded in disassociating himself from them so much so that his former allies invaded him the direct antecedent of the war occurred in july 1998 when kabila dismissed his rwandan chief of staff james kabarabe and formally requested that all rwandan military units leave the country instead on august 2nd the 10th brigade of the congolese army stationed in goma and primarily made up of tutsis announced their defection from the government these congolese rebels eventually renamed themselves the rally for congolese democracy or rcd and were backed by rwanda and uganda who soon invaded in support or perhaps more accurately the defecting rebels offered those two countries a retroactive justification for the war they already wanted this coalition struck their first devastating blow two days later in an attack they called operation katona led by the recently unemployed james cabarebe on august 4th 200 ugandan and rwandan troops flew aboard four boeing airliners stolen from goma to the katona air base located just 250 miles away from the capital city of kinshasa the lightly undefended base was quickly taken as much of the garrison force defected to the ugandan rwandan coalition the rebels and invaders then used it as a staging area for further troops and supplies to arrive over the course of the next day combined with the defectors from the democratic republic of congo's own armed forces the rebels had nearly 5 000 troops within striking distance of kinshasa by august 5th this intrepid attack seemed poised to overwhelm the nascent government before they had time to put up any meaningful resistance the situation was especially dire after they captured a number of cities in the congo central province including the provincial capital and congo's most important port matadi just three days later on august 13th the invading forces took the inga dams a critical target that provided power to kinshasa as this was occurring however it became clear that the rwandan ugandan alliance had made a critical miscalculation unlike the fighting against mabutu the government of congo had powerful foreign allies willing to come to its defense zimbabwe and angola were the first and most important of these allies providing air support and armor that kabila's forces desperately needed these new players proved too potent for the invading forces whose march to the capital was foiled by mid-august in a neatly symmetrical development the rwandan ugandan invasion ended with another daring plane hijacking this one at an airfield in angola in september though the invaders retreated from the western portion of the country on their stolen aircraft fighting continued in the country's northeastern province orientale by the end of the year even more nations were drawn into the conflict on either side in a tangled web of alliances that many observers thought reminiscent of the first world war aligning with kabila's congolese government were the already mentioned angola and zimbabwe whose leaders had vested financial interests in his regime as well as shared marxist leanings the angolans were concerned about their own rebels the national union for the total independence of angola or junita for short angolan president jose eduardo du santos suspected rwanda and uganda of backing the rebels who had been a thorn at the countryside since the 60s he was probably right before the war but once it got started their support for unita became overt up north sudan joined the angolan president's cause as a means of harassing their enemy uganda while chad joined mostly at the behest of france that's right france is involved too ready to make up for its utter failure to do anything useful during the rwandan genocide meanwhile namibia's president sam nujoma had personal ties to zimbabwe and committed his forces in part to honor this friendship and to fight unita there were a number of other independent or quasi-independent groups involved in the fighting but the last two that we're going to mention are the movement for the liberation of the congo or mlc and the lord's resistance army or lra if you thought there would be fewer abbreviations you haven't been paying attention the mlc was essentially a ugandan-backed alternative to those congolese defectors we mentioned earlier the rcd which was becoming increasingly influenced by rwanda such an alternative became necessary as relations between the two initial invaders deteriorated over the course of the war the lra meanwhile is a fundamentalist christian cult slash militia that was founded with sudanese support and remains at least nominally active to this day it's most notable for its leader joseph kony with all of these new powers involved a military stalemate eventuated and would continue for the rest of the conflict but only as far as large organized battles along the scale of operation katona went make no mistake though blood continued to be shed during the brutal proxy battles that occurred from there on out throughout 1999 numerous peace accords sponsored by the likes of muammar gaddafi and nelson mandela tried and failed to bring an end to the violence the rcd was not even invited to these accords which may seem like a major oversight but also a likely result of the fact that the group had splintered into competing factions this newly fractured group was difficult to negotiate with holistically for obvious reasons the next year ugandan and rwandan forces actually began to fight each other as well near the city of kisangani one of the earliest rebel strongholds with many of the nations involved both supporting and fighting both non-state actors in addition to each other the prospect of a peace settlement that would end the multi-polar conflict was growing increasingly complicated and unlikely over 5500 u.n peacekeeping forces did little to stop the violence as the dawn of a new millennium came and went the conflict seemed destined to remain a violent stalemate the first major change in years occurred on january 16th 2001 when laurent kabila was killed by his own child soldier bodyguard his son joseph succeeded him as the president of the democratic republic of congo and by all accounts seemed to have a better head for politicking under a u.n peace plan uganda and rwanda began their long withdrawals that would be finalized under the 2002 sun city and pretoria accords while the rcd and other rebel groups at least nominally began the process of disarming that process has not always gone smoothly and occasional fighting still occurs especially in the itori region having gone through all of that we still have a fairly important question why haven't you heard more about this war part of the issue is undoubtedly the tendency of western media and history courses to ignore the happenings of sub-saharan africa but there are other factors as well one of them is the complexity of the conflict which pitted one faction against another only to bring them together against a different faction only to tear them apart yet again moreover these myriad factions often employed guerilla tactics waging an asymmetrical style of warfare that defies easy summary other than operation katona large scale sieges and battles in this war are hard to come by this is the most recent topic we've ever covered on this channel and it is difficult to take an

Second World War [Music] when we last left off the desert fox was on the run in November 1942 her win Rommel and his forces escaped capture at the hands of Bernard Montgomery's 8th army he was outgunned and out matched but not out of the fight the last two months of the year would prove to be dramatic as would the next on November 8th 1942 more than a hundred thousand Allied troops landed at three points in Morocco and Algeria arriving to the rear of Rommels embattled Africa Corps the landing sites Casablanca Oran and Algiers were themselves a compromise between two very different visions on the part of American and British planners Winston Churchill's government had favored a more spread out large-scale deployment all over the Mediterranean coast of North Africa Americans on the other hand were still concerned about the loyalties of the Vichy French forces in the area perhaps more significantly Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Joint Chiefs feared the possibility that such a large movement in the western Mediterranean would provoke a response from nationalist Spain which had been nominally neutral so far but had a strong affinity for the Axis powers ultimately supreme Allied commander Dwight Eisenhower decided on a happy medium Operation Torch included three prongs which would reach into the Mediterranean but only as far as Algiers the Western task force was entirely made up of 30,000 American men and was led by George S Patton in their landing at Casablanca the center task force was made up of 13 9,000 American ground troops but with a British naval escort who landed in Iran Algeria lastly the eastern task force made up of 10,000 Americans and 23,000 British troops was also protected by the British Navy on its way to Algiers altogether the force involved in Operation Torch called the British first Army despite its heterogeneous makeup was more than a hundred thousand strong and led by British general Kenneth Anderson when they arrived on November 8th the disposition of Vichy forces in the area was largely still a mystery as military historian Brian Lane header explains French officers loyalty to the Vichy regime varied the Nazis were generally disliked - despised but seemingly non-stop British and American military disasters partly inspired confidence in defying the bare mocked though the Allies were uncertain of Vichy France's Allegiance US General Mark Clark met with Charles mast Resident General of France in Tunisia before the invasion as part of an extended campaign of subterfuge designed to garner French support in North Africa however the secret of Clark offered scant on details of Operation Torch many of the French troops stationed in the area had no idea what was coming when American and British troops set foot in French North Africa the Karason forces were so confused and hesitant that they did not resist the landings they did however put up stiff resistance at the cities of Casablanca and on this miscommunication was almost fatal to the operation since they had not expected meaningful resistance there had been no naval or aerial bombing in advance of the attack and it looked like the center and Western task forces were in trouble Eastern task force on the other hand had little difficulty ceasing Algiers which they did the same day they landed charles mast commanded the french in this and ordered his men to stand down with the tentative approval of his superior Admiral Francois Berlin the Admiral a notorious Nazi collaborator and deputy leader of the country was an opportunist above all and had hinted he would be willing to defect to the Allies seeing which way the winds were blowing he ordered a ceasefire first in algiers and then in north africa generally with basically no authority to do so Darla's negotiated a nominal cooperation agreement with the Allies on November 13th called the darlana agreement allowing for the use of civilian infrastructure as well as actual military support up north Hitler stopped pretending to respect French sovereignty and invaded the free zone that had remained unoccupied after the fall of France in 1940 on November 9th German reinforcements began flying in from their newly captured airfields into Tunisia by the end of the month the German soldiers in the country numbered 15,000 bolstered by another 9,000 Italians who arrived by Road from Tripoli both allied and Axis armies wanted to reach Tunis and fortify at first making the situation even more urgent was the coming Tunisian wet season heavy rains would likely mean impassable roads and perhaps more than a month of safety for whoever occupied the capital city when they began the war in northwest Africa was a race against time logistical delays meant that Kenneth Anderson could only begin the offensive on November 25th 1942 they advanced quickly along the coastal road but were checked around desert ten days later by the fifth Panzer Army among the reinforcements the 5th army had received were a handful of the cutting-edge Panzer 6 tiger tanks for when general Juergen von Arnim arrived on December 9th to take control of all Axis forces in Tunisia he had some of Nazi Germany's newest toys with him with these and his other assets von Arnim was able to expand his defensive position in Bizet and tunis into one larger defensive line from this strengthened position he was able to fend off Anderson's Christmas Eve offensive just as the infamous Tunisian downpours began operation torch had ground to a halt as 1942 came to an end the Germans and Italians would be able to defend their new perimeter in the new year but that tactical victory came at a strategic cost tanks and Men sent to Tunisia were desperately needed elsewhere especially against the Soviets in the east in early January Rommels retreating Africa Corps arrived in southeast Tunisia still on the run from Bernard Montgomery's Eighth Army knowing that he was seriously outnumbered and outmaneuvered by the two-pronged Allied advance he would take advantage of his ability to move more quickly within a constrained space to attack multiple points in quick succession leaving a partial force at the old French Mareth line he decided to attack the Western first Army while first aiming to drive them back through the narrow passes between the Atlas Mountains near Gafsa the assault saw reasonable success after a few probing attacks the true assault came on February 14th when the 21st Panzer Division attacked the u.s. 2nd corps destroying a hundred American tanks near sidi bouzid Rommel urged the division commander to continue the attack after his initial success but he waited another day for authorization from von Arnim who was technically in charge they pushed the Americans back 50 miles to Kasserine pass where they put up a stubborn resistance that lasted for five days meanwhile Rommel himself peeled off and captured an allied air field at telepathy On February 17th Rommel hoped to then push north - to besa an American logistical Nexus but Arnhem was unwilling to commit to such an aggressive instead on February 19th he was ordered to attack Northwest at tala instead just where Anderson was expecting when the axis finally punched through Kasserine on February 20th Anderson was ready with reinforcements and ground attack aircraft that beat Rommel back two days later having lost the momentum of his final assault and facing renewed allied strength Rommel was on the verge of defeat in North Africa and as it turned out attacking the Western pronged first may have been a grave miscalculation Montgomery's Eighth Army had been strung out in its pursuit and only one division faced the Mareth line On February 26 when Rommel attacked ten days later its strength had quadrupled having finally learned the utility of anti-tank guns in the field the British chewed right through Rommels forces and repelled his attack it was around this time that the desert fox allegedly dealing with serious illness was recalled to Europe it was an ignoble end to the famous generals campaign von Arnim was left in the unenviable position of picking up where Rommel had left off on March 17th George Patton's 2nd Corps tried to cut off the Africa Corps retreating along the coast to Tunis but their attack was ultimately parried in the mountain passes nonetheless the danger of such a development was established three days later the bulk of the Eighth Army began a more direct assault on the American while new New Zealand Corps made a wide flanking maneuver and assaulted from the rear near al Hama the frontal assault ultimately failed to completely punch through the line so Montgomery began shifting attention to the flank on March 23rd facing the prospect of encirclement the Germans and Italians began quickly retreating their defense at al Hama lasted long enough for most of the Africa Corps to escape before the Allies finally breached the line on March 28th on April 11th all axis elements had joined together in the northeastern portion of Tunisia you might think that the reasonable strategic decision at this point would be to pull your forces out of the theater to better defend Europe you'd be right but that's not what the axis did instead they demanded von Arnim defend a mile perimeter around Bazaar and Tunis by the end of April 1943 axes defenses in the region were being strained to the limit after steady allied advances a relative calm took hold for the next two weeks except to the northwest where Americans and a French North African Corps were able to reach within 20 miles of desert during this period anderson redeployed his forces in preparation for one final strike from the north using dummy tanks and other decoys to trick von Arnim into assuming the attack would instead come from the South overnight on Wednesday May 5th the 4th indian and 4th british infantry divisions broke through the German perimeter after an intensive aerial and artillery bombardment clearing the way for the 6th and 7th armored divisions though the British forces had only advanced about five miles closer to the city axis defenders could no longer effectively maneuver in their defence during the evening on Saturday the British entered Tunis while almost simultaneously the Americans and French broke into Bizet the formal surrender of Axis forces in the area resulting in as many as 250,000 prisoners wouldn't come until the next week finally bringing the war in that theatre to an end when all was said and done the worst fears of the German High Command had been realized in pursuit of Mussolini's new roman empire they had overextended themselves while forces were desperately needed elsewhere the North African campaign was a war of attrition and after three and a half years it was clear that the logistical apparatus of the Allies had decisively outmatched its axis counterpart Rommel strategic mind was undoubtedly gifted but so were those of his adversaries many of the Allied leaders that had cornered the desert fox would serve in the allied invasion of Sicily and the Normandy landings within the next two years Stephen W Sears writes this for some North Africa was the first step on the road to military fame Eisenhower became supreme commander of Allied forces in Europe with Montgomery the head of ground forces but for others the desert war was the climax of their military careers Wavell and Auchinleck later served in relative obscurity in the Far East General Ricci ended up as a poor commander in Europe under Montgomery for Irwin Rommel the future brought only disillusionment and doom in July 1944 a group of generals tried to kill the Fuhrer by planting a bomb in his headquarters Rommel took no part in it however he did not know that the conspirators plan to name him head of state if they succeeded but Hitler survived and in the purge that followed Rommel was implicated they

       " \" I'm very pleased to announce that today's video is sponsored by the great courses plus more on that later hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian today's video the Seven Years War part two in our last video you saw how colonial skirmishes and diplomatic twists started the 18th century's very own world war in this video we'll be discussing one more diplomatic reversal that managed to completely change the course of history before we get to that let's start off today's video with a completely unnecessary excuse for me to play with the reverb settings on my microphone it's 1758 and in one corner we have France Russia and Austria who have been stopping the competition in Central Europe and in the other we have the Anglo Russian alliance in serious need of a cutland but considering the fact that today the United States official language is English and not French you may have guessed that things turned around for the British and Prussians you'd be right but it didn't happen immediately Frederick had just suffered the greatest military disaster of his career after a string of defeats at ke and Maxim on the fields of Kerner's Dorf a name that would haunt Frederick's memory forever Prussian forces attempted an ambitious double in development hoping to overwhelm the Austrian and Russian armies massed near the Oder River but Frederick had used this tactic a variation of the oblique order before and his enemies were ready for it the Russians had heavily weighed their forces in the center and were able to dispatch reinforcements with ease wherever the Prussians attacked the battle marks the only time forces under Frederick himself broke order and retreated in total disarray Frederick's allies meanwhile enjoyed a reversal of fortune after successfully defeating the French in Madras India British forces won a series of victories all over the globe in a turn of events that should be thoroughly unsurprising to anyone who's ever read up on British history they began to utterly dominate the war at sea the Royal Navy was victorious at Guadeloupe Lagos and kiba on bay decisively extinguishing any threat of French invasion on the British mainland the ground forces in North America complemented these maritime triumphs after capturing the newly christened Fort Pitt the previous year British regular and colonial forces spent that spring securing their hold of the western frontier with victories at Fort Niagara and Fort carrion which gave them control of the Hudson Valley with that front secured it was time to move north all summer British forces under General James Wolfe lay siege to Quebec leading to the Battle of the plains of Abraham on September 13th yet another British success however Wolfe would not live to see his officers march through the streets as both he and the French commander Louise Joseph de Montcalm were killed in the fighting as 1759 drew to a close British supremacy abroad had been confirmed and they were well on their way to supplanting France as the premier global power the following year 1760 proved equally auspicious for the British on the battlefield but also saw the death of their King George ii died on October 25th possibly on the toilet that fact is not particularly important but the writer threatened to quit if we cut that from the script anyways he was succeeded by his grandson George the third who would oversee further victories around the globe in India where the British had actually been fighting the French and Indians Britain scored a decisive victory at the Battle of Wandy wash in January despite being outnumbered by 2,000 they then launched a renewed offensive and by September the French army and their remaining allies were trapped in their colonial capital at Pondicherry during the grueling three-month siege that followed civilians died in droves by early next year the French garrison surrendered and the British were victorious in India in North America the Redcoats and their colonial allies seized on the momentum that they had gained through the capture of Quebec to win several more easy victories that summer throughout the course of the war French support among Native American tribes operating in Ohio and Canada had steadily eroded the Shawnee and Lenape had made a separate peace with Britain in 1758 while many of these so-called Mission Indians those who had converted to Catholicism continued to fight up through 1760 at which point they too abandoned the war effort though some sporadic fighting did continue that year essentially meant the end of French Canada and the last major conflict in the theatre unsurprisingly Native Americans both who had aided the French and British allies ultimately got the short end of the stick but more on that later so how were things going for Frederick in Central Europe this year I think solidly mediocre would be a reasonable way to describe this situation the Swedes took control of a significant swathe of Pomerania in January while the French took Marburg and the Austrians captured the Silesian city of glutes that last defeat was especially damaging to Frederick's pride because the Austrian commander Aaron Stephane Loudon had once sought employment in his army but was rebuffed Frederick quickly struck back at him though defeating the Austrian forces at Leibnitz in August the following month brought an utterly humiliating defeat when Russian and Austrian troops captured and held Berlin from October 9th to the 12th despite the rather short occupation it was still a terrible blow to Prussia morale in keeping with the trend of Frederick winning battles while losing the war he ended the year with a success at the bat of torgul one that came at a heavy price a third of his troops as New Year's Day 1761 came and went the Seven Years War had seemingly contracted and appeared to be making a decisive end India and North America were no longer the sights of large-scale warfare and the British Empire had established supremacy in both theaters in Central Europe however the walls were closing in on Frederick Prussians and Hanoverians looked West to try to stymie the French but in doing so left kohlberg open to a Russian assault in December Elizabeth's forces took the city Russia's final port on the Baltic Sea creating a two-fold problem for the besieged Frederick Russia's greatest weakness it's chronic supply problems had just been resolved and Prussia's access to British naval assistance was curtailed not that the Brits were feeling especially helpful in fact the newly crowned George the 3rd was significantly less committed to supporting the Prussian cause than his predecessor had been George the 3rd immediately suspended financial aid to the beleaguered German state likely as the first step towards suing for peace after all the British had won in the corners of the world where they had fought so why should it be their problem if their Ally couldn't pull its own weight by now things were looking grim er than ever for the Prussians exact numbers are hard to find but by the year's end the maximum number of troops he had at his disposal was probably around sixty thousand who were up against hundreds of thousands of the combined French Austrian Russian and Swedish armies the hour was late and the enemies were at the door it was a foregone conclusion that Berlin would soon be under siege his only hope it seemed to him was the Ottomans it was a bit of a long shot to say the least but Frederick had been making diplomatic overtures to the Sultan for years and he thought that maybe just maybe they would start to bear fruit they ultimately didn't join but more than enough happened early in the year for things to remain interesting 1762 saw two new powers entering the war a full eight years after the conflict broke out in North America Spain's new king charles the third hope to capitalise on the weakness of Portugal still recovering from the disastrous 1755 Lisbon earthquake since Britain was most likely to challenge them in that regard and had important economic and diplomatic ties to Portugal he was quite receptive to French support to join the war the French in return hoped that the British would either have to divert troops to defend their allies or lose source of material and financial support perhaps alleviating some of the pressure from their most powerful adversary on January 4th war between Britain and Spain had begun the conflict was marked by three failed invasions of Portugal by Spanish and French troops throughout the year each one repulsed by the Lusitania pnes and their British allies a number of troops were mobilised in Brazil as well and the neighbouring Spanish colonies in South America but actual battlefield casualties were very rare and deaths were almost exclusively a result of disease as if this turn wasn't stunning enough Empress Elisabeth of Russia died exactly a day after the war in the peninsula broke out leaving Russia's commitment to the war effort in doubt as it turned out Elizabeth's successor Peter the 3rd was something of a frederick fanboy and almost immediately sued for peace despite Russia's highly advantageous position frederick anxious to end hostilities promptly offered East Prussia to the Russians but much to the entirety of Europe surprise Peter refused all he wanted was to be given the order of the black eagle a chivalric honor awarded by the Prussian government presumably with a bewildered shrug frederick agreed and Peter placed most of the Russian troops under Frederick's command who joined the Prussians in the field by June 1762 Sweden which had only really entered the war opportunistically simply said nope and backed out of the war meanwhile Frederick took this opportunity to reinvent Alesia but the new Rousseau Prussian alliance did not last long as Peter was deposed and killed in a coup organized by his own wife and Frederick's distant cousin Catherine the second in July having successfully Game of Thrones her husband the newly widowed Empress withdrew her armies from Central Europe probably because the plot twists were becoming too unbelievable before they left however they did help contribute to one more Prussian victory at Berger's Dorf where frederick allegedly bribed the russian commander to stay put for a little while the Austrians under font down assumed the Prussians had more fresh troops available and handing them a victory France's crushing defeats in India North America and Portugal as well as Austria's in Silesia had fatally drained both country's Treasuries seeing Austrian prospects for the reconquest of Silesia disappear and suffering under a brutal British blockade Louis soon sued for peace the Austrians were not far behind the official peace treaties would not be signed until the next year but for all intents and purposes the Seven Years War was over [Music] the first of two documents that ended the war was the Treaty of Paris no not that one nope nope nope yep that's the one signatories of this treaty included Great Britain France and Spain with Portugal being expressly included under the terms of the treaty certain possessions that had been captured during the war like the many sugar rich Caribbean islands and part of the African colony of Senegal were returned to their original owners nonetheless in terms of territory Britain was the biggest winner France renounced all claims in India made since 1749 they also gave Britain all territory in North America east of the Mississippi except Norland that was given to Spain as compensation for Florida which had in turn also been ceded to Great Britain speaking of North America as we already mentioned the Native Americans living in eastern Canada and the Ohio Valley now had to deal almost exclusively with the British some like the Micmacs and certain members of the Iroquois Confederacy felt compelled to ally with them with many eventually fighting on the British side during the American Revolution before eventually aligning with the British many Native American tribes made war with their new Imperial overlords reigning in Ohio in Pontiacs rebellion which started in 1763 hoping to stern the violence towards the third issue the royal proclamation of 1763 later that year thereby forbidding the settlement of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains the colonists who had just fought a war in part to take said land from the French promptly ignored it in Central Europe Prussia Austria and Saxony signed the Treaty of Hubert osburgh five days after the Treaty of Paris bringing an official end to the asylum theatres of war the terms of peace returned clots to Prussia and reconfirmed its control over Silesia in return for the prussian evacuation of saxony the war in this theater had proven that frederick was an exceptional battlefield commander and prussia was a force to be reckoned with but it also demonstrated it would need strong allies in any future conflict Austria and Russia meanwhile had proven themselves competent military powers that could keep up with Western Europe's finest a truly global conflict arguably the first of its kind the Seven Years War had a profound impact on the world Britain's supremacy in both North America and India was solidified while France began a precipitous decline we didn't talk much about the conflict in West Africa since it was mostly confined to small British expeditions against wealthy French colonies but it does emphasize how far-reaching the war was battles fought on four continents placed an enormous logistical and financial strain on all of the powers involved the economic woes that ensued are widely seen as a major cause for both the American and French Revolutions the year 1763 may have been the end of the Seven Years War but its outcome would reverberate down these centuries and shape the world as we live in today if you want to learn more

battle of berlin [Music] it is april 30th 1945. the third reich has fallen and the red army has occupied most of berlin adolf hitler's plans of enzig were ultimate victory completely unravel as the din of artillery fire and tank shells begins to rupture the fuhrer bunker to him the german people were at fault if only they had fought harder feiglinga cowards he exclaims on the other side of the room is lieutenant general hans bower an accomplished pilot and trusted member of hitler's staff in resignation he tells him power smith foreign the voice that was once renowned for its bombastic fury reduced to a soft murmur the pilot tries to convince the fuhrer to escape volunteering to transport him to japan argentina or the middle east where he could live out the rest of his days in obscurity however hitler has made his decision the creek vietnamese the battle for the city was among the final major offensives of the second world war and it marked the climactic end of the nazi empire which had contracted just as fast as it expanded in 1945 berlin had a population of about 3 million down from 4.3 million before the outbreak of war just six years ago as early as the christmas of 1944 morale among berliners had reached a critical low point with only the most staunch and fanatic of the nazi regime clinging to any hope british and american air raids only continued to intensify prompting many residents to spend more time in shelters than not but it was not the british nor the americans that they truly feared it was that lingering threat from the east the successor state to the nation that had nearly humbled frederick the great the state whose people had suffered so much the ussr the symbols etched into the walls of the air raid shelters were said to mean leath learn russian quickly every berliner knew the soviets were coming thanks to the reich minister of propaganda joseph goebbels and his efforts morale in berlin did improve after the initial stages of the ardennes counter-offensive also known as the battle of the bulge which delayed the allied advance by five to six weeks however the more perceptive members of the german high command were still fretful knowing that the reich was not in a state to protect its eastern border properly most notably general heinz guderian chief of the general staff and general reinhardt galen head of the military intelligence department for the eastern front were fully aware of the impending red army advance which severely outnumbered and outgunned its german counterpart intelligence even knew about the general time frame of the invasion three weeks and where it would happen the line along the river vestula and thus it was argued that since the arden offensive wasn't bearing fruit despite what propaganda said much of their strength should be diverted to the east however hitler remained unconvinced believing that the odds could not be so stacked against the superior germans and he was validated by his right-hand man heinrich himmler who claimed the notion of a soviet offensive little more than a bluff with his delusions reinforced by his advisors hitler diverted troops from the vestula specifically panzer troops not to set up a defensive line against the soviets but to launch an ill-advised counter-attack on hungary's oil fields predicting that german forces would be able to break through to budapest despite the fact that the city had been surrounded by the red army since christmas this relief attempt promptly failed and the soviets took the city on february 13th then the germans launched operation northwind in the west which prolonged the allied advance but defanged the already battered luftwaffe the germans lacked any capability to launch a thrust into allied or soviet territory its enemy in the east had 6.7 million men spread on a front ranging from the baltic to the adriatic coast well over twice the size of the german army during their invasion of the soviet union in 1941 which up until then had been the largest invading force in history of those 2.5 million men 41 600 guns and mortars and 6 250 tanks and assault guns constituted the invading force against berlin which faced approximately 1 million germans with 10 400 guns and mortars and 1 500 tanks and assault guns in the air germany didn't fare any better the soviet military deployed 7 500 aircraft against 3 300 german aircraft but these numbers didn't faze hitler or his top advisors hermann goring the supreme commander of the luftwaffe in a stunning display of cognitive dissonance dismissed soviet air superiority claiming they were not real planes the germans did get some things right though joining me today is my friend potential history to talk about just that and give you a general overview of the state of the red army at this point the germans understood that soviet troops in some cases exhibited a lack of discipline and this was especially evident among young officers eager to prove themselves to their troops despite that though the reigning belief that the soviets were effective mainly due to their overwhelming numerical advantage while looking like the obvious conclusion on the surface doesn't tell the full story the soviets outmaneuvered and outplanned the germans as early on as 1942 and capitalized on their successes by taking huge slaves of land and their offensives in 1943 44 and 45 on top of all of these factors with the end of the war feeling so close at hand the red army's morale was at an all-time high knowing the soviets were coming for retribution yosef goebbels readied a force of 60 000 untrained individuals comprising the lame elderly and women many of these soldiers though i hesitate to even call them soldiers had up to just five rounds of ammunition on them at any time fighting alongside these troops were members of the hitler youth some of which were as young as 15 as well as the fanatic remnants of the veteran ss at this point the fuhrer remained determined proclaiming with his usual gusto the enemy will be greeted by massive artillery fire gaps in our infantry will have been made good by countless new units the bolshevik must and shall bleed to death before the capital of the german reich [Music] the eve of the offensive had come and the red army sappers began clearing minefields laying the preparation for tanks to cross the bridgehead on the vestula and to further worsen germany's situation hitler ordered the panzer reserves located in the region to move forward putting them right in the range of soviet artillery the soviet assault began at 5am moscow time on january 12th under a snowy sky it was a sweeping offensive with the russians easily dispatching the panzer division sent against them and heading straight into silesia as well as east prussia over the next few days the red army conquered everything in its path it was not long before the vestula line collapsed completely but instead of resting on their laurels the soviets continued to move at breakneck speed over the course of a two-week period the red army captured essentially all of poland and were only 69 kilometers or 43 miles from berlin despite this auspicious and speedy start soviet general gyorgy zhukov renowned commander of the first bello russian front decided to wait until april to march on berlin itself as a counter-attack from the germans in pomerania had to be repelled hitler may have survived the ides of march but the ides of april would spell his doom the three soviet fronts from the offensives that had taken place up to that point the first bella russian front the second bella russian front and the first ukrainian front had an estimated 2.5 million men the soviets were preparing to completely encircle berlin not for a strategic purpose per se but in order to keep the western allies out on april 16th the battle of zelo heights began as part of the larger battle of order naisa nearly 1 million soviet soldiers and over 20 000 tanks and guns were sent to the gates of berlin against a hundred thousand germans and twelve hundred guns and tanks the battle only lasted four days before zhukov's men breached through taking thirty thousand losses compared to only twelve thousand german losses zhukov was eager to be the first one in berlin in order to beat out the commanders of the other two fronts at any cost necessary stalin wanted the three commanders to race to the german capital and stalin as we all know was not a man you wanted to displease the next day april 20th was hitler's birthday and the soviet's gift to him was a complete encirclement of his capital along with heavy shelling two days later the shelling continued uninterrupted and hitler ordered his 9th and 12th armies to link up who had been occupied on the western front and engaged the soviets this culminated in a number of different engagements one of which the battle of bouncin was actually a german victory but it was too little too late the red army would not be dislodged [Music] by april 25th the soviets were in berlin itself but the germans weren't done yet just as in stalingrad urban warfare commenced the germans fought street history mounting machine guns snipers and anti-tank weaponry on apartment rooftops where soviet tanks couldn't reach them in response soviet tanks stuck to the shoulder of the roads and machine guns were mounted to their sides anti-aircraft guns were used to target germans on rooftops and flamethrowers and grenades were used to flush out the city's most defiant defenders unlike in stalingrad there were fewer instances of house to house fighting and a greater number of buildings being leveled by self-propelled artillery having encircled berlin before entering it from all sides fighting raged on all over the city coursing through the suburbs as well the germans were pushed back heavily near the reichstag that proud historic sea of parliament that the nazis had gutted in their ascent to power while the first and second bell russian armies remained in the city konev commander of the first ukrainian front ordered a portion of his force to disengage in order to stop the german 9th army from rendezvouing with the german 12th army and relieving berlin thereafter on april 30th the soviets were advancing toward the reichstag itself a network of trenches tunnels moats and guns surrounded the area and many red army troops were gunned down as they tried to close in but gradually the perimeter became tighter and tighter and the defender's numbers began to dwindle when the soviets finally breached the reichstag fierce room-to-room fighting commenced on the following day may 2nd the red army finally neutralized the reichstag and iconically raised the soviet flag over it veiling surrendered thereafter and the war in europe was at an end on the same day as berlin caved in around him hitler committed suicide some ten thousand germans remained of the three hundred thousand that had been drummed up general hamilt weidling who took over as the last commander of the berlin defense area realized the hopelessness of the situation and made it clear that he favored surrender only yosef goebbels opposed him but his resistance was short-lived as the next day goebbels took his own life alongside his family [Music] [Music]

       " \" today's video is brought to you by world of warships more on that later hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian today's video the seven years war a war that actually spanned for nine years and was the first large-scale globe-spanning conflict in history preceding the first world war by over a century and a half [Music] in our first video on the seven years war we're going to be covering the period from 1754 to 1758 which constitutes roughly half of the conflict buckle in as our journey will take us from the wilderness of north america to the mediterranean sea and down to the tip of india in the evening of july 3 1754 a 22 year old lieutenant colonel in the british militia sat inside a hastily constructed palisade ill-advisedly located at the bottom of a valley about 50 miles outside of modern day pittsburgh the lieutenant colonel had been handed a demand of surrender written in a language that he did not speak he signed it without realizing that he had just confessed his guilt in the assassination of joseph de joumanville an enemy officer killed five weeks earlier in a small skirmish in the contested ohio valley that spring in the early morning of july 4th he and his troops marched shamefully back from whence they came jummaville's death and the humiliating defeat at fort necessity would ultimately steal both french and british resolve for a war that would engulf five continents for his part the young virginian officer seemed to develop a taste for conflict despite the embarrassment of his first and only surrender his name was george washington and he remarked in a letter to his brother i have heard bullets whistle and believe me there was something charming in the sound war had still technically not been declared yet following washington's failed venture into the ohio valley general edward braddock was dispatched early the following year to show the future american president how a british gentleman conducted himself in battle not well as it turns out braddock led a force of more than two thousand into the valley that spring he never made it to the french position of fort duquesne despite outnumbering the french and native american garrison two to one meanwhile at sea britain began fully exercising her naval power boarding and capturing hundreds of french merchant ships if there's three advantages the british navy had over that of the french navy its more robust ships more experienced sailors and the modern battleship the hms hood except britain didn't launch the hms hood until 1918 which means we won't

braddock's forces wandered into an ambush in which enemy soldiers fired down on them from the tree lines above losing nearly 1 000 men braddock himself was mortally wounded in the excursion before we continue it is worth noting that american indian troops played a major role in most of the battles in north america they more often supported the french but different tribes fought on each side in particular the ojibwe tribe wabanaki confederacy ottawa shawnee lenape and huron tribes sided with the french the iroquois confederacy catawba indian nation and mohican tribe sided with the british lastly the cherokee nation would fight against both countries at one point or another one of the few times that the british did manage to get the upper hand in america was when militia troops from nova scotia crossed the misaguash river into french canada on june 16th massachusetts militia led by lieutenant colonel robert muncten took control of fort beauceu a french position meant to project power throughout acadia once he secured control of the area the british began what historian fred anderson has called possibly the first time in modern history that a civilian population was forcibly removed as a security risk this mass deportation called legrand de langema ultimately resulted in the displacement of 11 500 people many of whom eventually died of disease or due to shipwrecks [Music] 1756 saw great britain and france finally declare war on each other two years after the shooting started why reason number one is because it was the convention colonial powers typically let their subjects wage colonial wars without going to war themselves however to get the full answer we'll need to travel back to europe in 1748 this year saw the conclusion of the war of the austrian succession through the signing of the treaty of ex-la chapelle which saw maria theresa retain the habsburg throne and most of europe's borders remaining stagnant with the exception of prussia's acquisition of the resource-rich silesia the somewhat inconclusive outcome to the war meant that an austrian attempt to retake the territory was almost guaranteed in preparation for the war that he knew was coming frederick the great of prussia began laying the groundwork to avoid being outnumbered by austria's potential allies namely russia he once wrote of all of our neighbors russia is the most dangerous those who come after me will be well advised to cultivate those barbarians for they could ruin prussia without fear of reprisal frederick's fears were realized as in 1746 austria and russia signed a defensive alliance to try to circumvent that issue he made an alliance with great britain in january of 1756 in the convention of westminster despite the country's treaty obligations to the russian empire frederick also didn't bother re-signing his pre-existing alliance with france because he assumed that the french would remain opposed to austria regardless the madem to pompadou the court mistress of louis xv who despised frederick had the king's ear frederick assumed that she would urge louis to stay out of war she did not france reluctantly signed the first treaty of versailles just four months later aligning themselves with the austrians and russians thanks to the cunning austrian diplomat wenzel anton in a turn of events that should be familiar to those who have studied the first world war a tangle of alliances called the diplomatic revolution intended to preserve peace would eminently lead to the vicious outbreak of war the colonial struggle between britain and france finally made its way to europe when the french captured the british fort saint philippe on the island of menorca in june this escalation mostly brought on by britain's naval raids on french commerce was the primary reason for the declaration of war king george ii fond of his holdings in hanover knew the french would come after it soon he attempted to bring the dutch into the war but they were indifferent to the cause realizing that a larger war was inevitable frederick seized on what he saw as his only hope a preemptive strike on saxony a sizable holy roman imperial state beginning in august in order to protect his flank he left some of his forces in east prussia and silesia to defend against attacks via russia and austria respectively frederick had hoped to sweep through saxony forcibly conscripting their army and appropriating their treasury before moving through bohemia and moravia to march on vienna but the saxons put up a bitter fight at dresden and perna and when the saxon king finally did surrender in october it came at the expense of much more time and many more prussian lives than frederick had anticipated by the time he had made his winter headquarters the austrians had successfully invaded and occupied the southern portion of silesia things were going somewhat poorly for frederick and the british were having difficulties in north america too losing fort bull and for william henry [Music] before we go any further i'd like to call attention to william pitt the british prime minister as of july 1756 his strategy to defeating the superior french army was to engage it on his terms he avoided mainland france to focus instead on its lesser defended colonies however the german state of hanover under the same crown as great britain had to be protected so pitt's plan was twofold instead of pouring money into an outmatched land army pitt invested resources into supporting his prussian allies whose ground forces had the capability to stand up to france's primary force with britain's european possessions protected pitt could initiate the second part of his plan by opening up additional fronts across the globe in order to overextend the french in a war of attrition as he was confident that france could not contend with britain's navy with this plan in mind the following year saw the opening of a third theater of war as conflict broke out between the british and french east india companies both european states were vying to fill the power vacuum left by the ailing mughal empire this theater called the third carnatic war began with some smaller skirmishes in the south an inciting incident had taken place in the previous summer in bengal where several british soldiers were imprisoned in the infamous black hole prison by the local ruler for three days with only a few surviving this was a factor leading to the first major battle which occurred when the british forces commanded by the renowned colonel robert clive rested control of the french-aligned bengal in the battle of plassey in late june during this battle the british were outnumbered roughly 16 to 1 with no cavalry but were still able to achieve victory this is partially due to a sudden rainfall that ruined the powder of the indian army believing the british also lost their powder which they had evidently kept safe the indians launched a cavalry charge only to be blown away by the british artillery in europe frederick had spent the spring cutting a bloody swath through bohemia and eventually besieging prague austria's count leopold fondan led a relief force that dislodged the embattled prussian king at the battle of kalin in june that defeat as well as reports of a russian invasion in east prussia forced frederick to turn back russian zarina elizabeth's men had taken mamel but had been unable to go further due to the element that stops any force in eastern europe logistics meanwhile the french had launched an assault on hanover against a british-led army the french achieved victory in the battle of hastenbeck outnumbering their foes by twenty-five thousand this resulted in a peace treaty between the french and hanover in september called the convention of closted savin needless to say this wasn't something frederick was all too happy about at this point the last thing frederick needed was yet another enemy and you know what he got another enemy sweden smelled blood and invaded pomerania that summer the british and prussians were now severely outnumbered despite the odds stacked against him frederick won two decisive battles in november and december first he defeated the french at the battle of rosbach on november 5th and then a month later he routed the austrians at the battle of lloyd despite being heavily outnumbered frederick always considered loyten to be his greatest achievement but it did not change the fact that he was still fighting an uphill battle maria therese's husband francis the first successfully rallied many of these smaller german principalities against prussia as austria and france began their full-scale invasions meanwhile george ii disavowed the convention of claustraven and hanover re-entered the war command was given to duke ferdinand of brunswick who was able to lead the forces of hanover to victory against the french in the spring he drove them across the rhine and kept prussia's western border secure for the rest of the conflict in north america the french continued to rack up wins against the british including the infamous defeat at fort william henry in august in which almost the entire british garrison of 2500 troops was captured this state of affairs changed in 1758 with the british finally seeing some success in this theater though the french held on to fort carry on and with it most of the hudson valley the british were able to capture louis boar in canada and fort duquesne that troublesome french position in pennsylvania that started all of this duquesne was renamed fort pitt roughly located in today's downtown pittsburgh in india most of the british forces were tied up in bengal that left an opening for the remaining french and their allies to attack fort saint david and the city of madras they successfully captured the fort however heavy monsoon rains and poor preparation cost them precious time during their advance on the city by the time they began their siege it was december and the british were preparing for a counter-attack after a month of fighting and siege work six british ships loaded with men supplies and guns breached the blockade forcing the french to withdraw back in europe frederick spent the early months of 1758 attempting and then aborting another incursion into moravia meanwhile the russians re-entered east prussia which they would hold onto for the next four years the russians did not advance much farther due to supply line limitations that led to shortages in ammunition and food in august frederick made an attempt to expel elizabeth's troops at the battle of tsorndorf with 42 000 men the russians outnumbered frederick by nearly 6 000. with both sides taking heavy casualties the bloody battle ended inconclusively the final major event of the european theater this year came in october after frederick misread his adversary's intentions this time in the saxon village of hakker count fond down whom frederick had fought with the year before had a reputation as an overly cautious commander who never attacked unless he had perfect positioning and visibility since colleen frederick had repeatedly failed to goad fawn down into battle and began to believe that the austrian commander would never make his move but as the church bell struck five o'clock in the morning on october 14th 80 000 austrian soldiers began their attack while the prussians were still sleeping in their tents fighting in the streets of the town was brutal but the battle only lasted five hours despite putting up a good fight frederick's 35 000 men could not hope to fend off the vastly superior austrian force for long at 10 15 the prussians were in full retreat leaving behind almost all of their artillery and around 9 400 men dead were captured nearly a third of their army the battle could have been a death blow if fond down had chosen to press his advantage instead the count reaffirmed his supremely cautious reputation choosing not to pursue this gave frederick's forces all the time they needed to lick their wounds and come back with a vengeance as 1758 came to a close the 18th century's world war was in full swing even though the anglo-prussian alliance was being beaten back on all fronts the two powers were far from defeated the expenditure of blood and treasure would last for another

       " ' - We\\'re very excited to\\nannounce that today\\'s video is sponsored by Audible,\\nmore on that later. Hi, I\\'m Griffin Johnson,\\nthe armchair historian. Today\\'s video, Operation Market Garden, a World War II tutorial on\\nhow not to use paratroopers. (dramatic music) On September 17th, 1944 several\\nthousand allied airborne dropped from the skies into\\nthe Nazi occupied Netherlands. More landed the next\\nday and the day after, comprising British, American,\\nand even Polish troops. This force constituted the single, largest airborne operation in history. It\\'s objective was to open up a route to the German Industrial\\nHeartland, The Ruhr Valley, in an attempt to end the war early. Instead Market Garden ended up being on of the greatest allied\\nsetbacks of the 2nd World War, in this video we\\'re going to\\nbe going through the operation day by day and location by location to explore why Market\\nGarden was a bridge too far. Market Garden was the brain\\nchild of Bernard Montgomery. Famous for commanding British forces during the late north African campaign. It was designed to test\\nBernard\\'s favored strategy for the final phase of the war in Europe by concentrating allied forces for a small yet powerful thrust into Germany. Supreme Allied commander Dwight\\nEisenhower whom Montgomery often clashed with had been championing a so called broad strategy of keeping Allied forces distributed\\nalong a wide front keeping pressure on German positions along the entire border. When offensive progress\\nbegan to slow following the liberation of Brussels\\nin early September, Eisenhower gave the go ahead to implement a smaller scale version\\nof Montgomery\\'s plans for a narrow front. His approval was designed to test both the strategic viability of such a thrust and the effectiveness of\\nthe Allied Airborne Army. Still relatively new\\nto the field of battle. So what was Montgomery\\'s proposal? The plan called for a\\nmassive flanking maneuver around the heavily fortified\\nGerman Siegfried line through the low countries. If that sounds familiar,\\nit\\'s because that\\'s exactly what the Germans did to the\\nFrench in both World Wars with varying degrees of success. Hey, if it\\'s not broken,\\ndon\\'t fix it right? Market Garden was actually the combination of two component operations\\nnamed, you guessed it, Market and Garden. Operation Market was\\nthe airborne component in which paratroopers would\\nland at several points between the Dutch cities\\nof Arnhem and Eindhoven, so secure the bridges over the Meuse, Waal and lower Rhine Rivers as\\nwell as a number of canals. If you\\'ve ever been to the\\nNetherlands you\\'ll know it\\'s about 70% river, so\\nthese points had to be taken before operation Garden, the\\nlarge scale deployment of armor over the Dutch-German\\nborder could commence. This joint force, which\\nconsisted of 50,000 troops, of the 30th core under\\nLieutenant General Brian Horrocks was to begin in the\\nsouthwest and end at Arnhem. Allied commanders hoped\\nthat if Market Garden was successful, they could end the war by Christmas of 1944. Before we delve into the details about what exactly transpired\\nthere\\'s a few things we should go over. First off, those who don\\'t know already, paratroopers are light infantry units, who can\\'t carry very heavy weapons, so historically they\\'ve\\nhad to rely on surprise and speed to gain the advantage. Throughout this video you\\'ll\\nnotice how the Allies failed to play at those strengths. Moreover, operation Market\\nGarden was predicated on an overly optimistic timetable that assumed that the\\nparatroopers could hold out long enough for the\\n30th core to reach them. On top of that, the soft\\nDutch soil was judged to be impassable for\\nmechanized and heavy armor, so the 30th core had to\\nfollow a single paved highway that narrow channel of movement\\nleft them badly exposed to German anti-tank fire from\\nall sides while traveling. Furthermore Allied planners\\ndid not heed a report from the Dutch resistance\\nthat a veteran panzer core was stationed nearby\\nundergoing maintenance but still capable of defensive deployment. Now I don\\'t know about you but\\nthat sounds like a great way to lose rock, paper, scissors. Or you know, infantry tank, anti-tank. Now let\\'s get onto the operation. (dramatic music) Tomorrow we go into action,\\nif by sacrificing all this, I leave a world slightly\\nbetter than I found it, I am perfectly willing\\nto make that sacrifice. Private Ivor Rowbery, South\\nStaffordshire Regiment, killed in action, September 17th, 1944. An air armada of nearly\\n1500 allied aircraft and more than 400 gliders\\ntake to the skies, the paratroopers aboard these planes will be dropped far into enemy territory completely surrounded\\nand nearly 60 miles away from friendly territory. In the early afternoon,\\nthe first paratroopers hit the ground, the initial insertions are actually quite successful with soldiers at all major sites accurately hitting their landing zones. However Lloyd Clark a military historian at the University of\\nBuckingham, notes that, the Allied operation\\nbegan with airborne troops accurately hitting their drop zones yet their very success actually\\nassisted the German response from the start. Because the troops weren\\'t scattered, the Germans could easily pinpoint\\nwhere they hit the ground and make a quick deduction\\nof the likely objectives of the allied operation. Furthest to the North is Arnhem, where the first British airborne division under Major General Roy Urquhart, are to take a road\\nbridge and a rail bridge that both cross the lower Rhine. Urquhart\\'s force lands a\\ndozen miles to the west of their targets due to a concentration of German anti-aircraft batteries near the town of Oosterbeek. They are forced to fight through\\nscattered German opposition to push through objectives. This resistance does not\\ninitially stop Urquhart\\'s men but it does seriously delay them. What\\'s more the allies lack enough planes to transport all of the men\\nrequired for this attack. Thus a large contingent\\nof the first airborne must stay behind to\\nprotect the landing sites and supply drops. In yet another stroke of bad luck, the radio sets the British are using experience technical failure\\nthat actively eliminates General Urquhart\\'s ability\\nto communicate with his men or with artillery and air support. While the German\\'s are\\ngetting more organized, the Allies are getting\\nprogressively less organized. Only 750 men second battalion\\ncommanded by John Frost reaches either of the\\ndivisions objectives. Their secondary objective, a rail bridge, is destroyed just as they arrive, so they hastily move on\\ntowards their primary target, the Arnhem Bridge and hold up in 18 houses just north of the bridge. Reinforcements are stopped by the German Kampfgruppe\\nSpindler, assembled primarily from elements of the\\nninth SS Panzer division, leaving Frost on his\\nown for the time being. To the south the US 82nd\\nairborne infantry division under Brigadier General\\nJim Gavin, or \"Jumpin\\' Jim\", as his men like to call\\nhim, lands with 7500 troops near Nijmegen, they take the southernmost of their two objectives, the\\nbridge over the Maas River as well as the undefended\\nGroesbeek heights to the southeast where supplies and\\nreinforcements will be dropped in the coming days. From here they begin\\nshelling the nearby forest of Reichswald, from which they expect a German counter attack. Though they aren\\'t certain. Later that same day a\\nsmall detachment of 400 men is sent to capture the second\\nbridge over the Waal River just north of Nijmegen. Unfortunately for the Americans\\nthe 10th SS panzer division made up of approximately 3000 men rushes in to stop them from\\nreaching their objective. In Eindhoven the 101st\\nairborne under Maxwell D Taylor lands and captures three of\\nthe five intended targets. Crucially however, the\\nmen of the 101st fail to take the crossings at Best and Son which Nazi forces blow up behind them. Both of these bridges cross the same canal so at least one has to be reconstructed if troops are going to cross. The process greatly\\nslows down the advance. Worse still, an Allied glider\\nattached to the 101st crashes and plans for\\nthe entire operation fall into German hands. Despite some success,\\nOperation Market Garden is not exactly off to an auspicious start. The landing was due at 10\\no\\'clock but it came and went and no aircraft, gliders,\\nor anything appeared, Gordon \"Jock\" Walker,\\nSergeant British Army Film and Photographic unit. The next morning poor weather in England, prevents the launch of\\na second airborne wave that was initially\\nscheduled for 0600 hours. That deployment and many of\\nthe subsequent supply drops, scheduled for today\\nfailed to arrive on time if they arrive at all. As dawn breaks, John Frost is all alone, he and the Second battalion are in Arnhem, repelling contingents of\\nthe Kampfgruppe Spindler that scrambled up from\\nNijmegen from the South the night before. The second battalion is\\ndoing an admirable job but is surrounded and\\nrunning low on supplies. The first and third slowly make their way into western Arnhem but are\\nstopped by German forces in the city and do not\\nsuccessfully link up with the second. Meanwhile the fourth\\nbattalion finally makes their landing but does not\\njoin the rest of the division on this day. Urquhart himself is pinned\\ndown during the advance of the first battalion and actually hides inside of a Dutch house for the day. Without a functioning radio to\\nkeep in contact with his men, he is considered missing in action, thereby putting Brigadier\\nGeneral Phillip Hicks in temporary command. In Nijmegen the Americans of\\nthe 82nd have beaten back a small German attack and are reinforced with a second wave of paratroopers. However they have yet to take\\nthe all important Waal Bridge and the Germans have begun\\ncrossing the river by boat setting up defensive positions around the American subjectives. German commanders now I\\'m\\npossession of the Allied war plans conclude that victory\\nat Nijmengen is crucial to the overall defeat of Market Garden. Victory at Arnhem and\\nEindhoven would be meaningless without a route between them. Speaking of which, the British 30th core arrives in Eindhoven late in the day and begins construction\\nof a makeshift bridge, while the 101st airborne holds off attacks from a handful of hastily\\nassembled German forces from the west. I think we\\'re going a bridge too far, Lieutenant General Frederick Browning, apocryphally, during the planning of operation Market Garden. In Arnhem John Frost is\\noutnumbered, outgunned, and becoming increasingly desperate. His forces now occupy only 10 houses on the northern side of Rhine bridge. The second battalion is\\nunable to stop German tanks from crossing and comes\\nunder heavy artillery fire. The remaining battalions\\nmake one more push to move through western\\nArnhem and are beaten back so severely that they\\nactually have to retreat past their original landing zones. Meaning that the German\\nwould get their hands on all of the new supplies. In the confusion Urquhart does manage to rejoin the first airborne\\nat least what was left of it. Meanwhile the first Polish\\nindependent paratrooper brigade meant to reinforce the British\\ndivision is still unable to deploy because of\\npoor weather in England and the Netherlands. Meanwhile the 30th core\\nfinishes construction and proceeds to Nijmegen where it links up with the 82nd airborne. The newly combined force\\nattempts to take the Waal Bridge but advances only slowly. Lastly the 101st airborne is still holding it\\'s position in the south\\nand repels a counterattack against a makeshift crossing by the 107th panzer division. Hand grenades flew in every direction. Each house had to be taken this way. Some of the British offered\\nresistance to their last breath, a German soldier at Arnhem. The rest of the first\\nairborne gives up hope of reaching these second battalion as it is pushed into an\\nincreasingly compact area around eastern Oosterbeek. Frost himself is captured. The Polish reinforcements\\nare nowhere to be found however hope comes from\\nthe south as Allied forces in Nijmegen finally make\\nsome progress by sending a contingent of troops\\nacross the river by boat and attacking the Germans from the rear. The 30th core and 82nd\\nairborne finally take control of the bridge at Nijmegen\\nby the end of the day. The retreating Germans attempt and fail to destroy the crossing on their way out, surprisingly the 30th corp\\ndoes not immediately move out as several of their elements\\nare still pinned down in the city. A rare bright spot for the\\nAllies in this operation. The capture of Nijmegen\\nmeans that the center of their corridor is secure for now. Out of ammunition. God save the King, final transmission from the second battalion,\\nFirst British Airborne division on September 24th, 1944. The second battalion at Arnhem Bridge is completely wiped out by\\noverwhelming German forces today ending their impressive hold out. Approximately 1984 men are\\nkilled and 6,854 captured. Urquhart does not have time to grieve. The remaining members\\nof the first Airborne now only 3500 out of 10,000 try\\nto hold onto a strip of land north of the river where\\npotential new bridge could be constructed. Throughout the day, 750 Polish fighters, roughly at half strength\\nunder Stanislaw Sosabowski finally touch down in Driel,\\nto the southeast under a reign of gunfire, the onslaught decimates them, as the 30th core relentlessly harassed by German artillery fire\\nfinally gets in range of Oosterbeek and starts\\nto provide supporting fire. The soldier on the stretcher\\nat my feet lay upwards, his eyes heavily bandaged. I had no further use\\nnow for my steel helmet so I took it off and covered his face, Godfrey Freedman, British\\nglider pilot captured at Arnhem. Today the tides really start\\nto turn against the Allies. In Arnhem 60 Poles\\nmanage to cross the Rhine and join with the first airborne which itself is now\\nrunning out of supplies. Bad weather has deprived\\nthem of crucial air support as well as the ability to resupply. When German Colonel Kurt Student launches a massive counterattack against both sides of the Eindhoven-Nijmegen corridor, the 30th core and 82nd airborne\\nhave to take valuable time to reestablish a link to the south. Urquhart is still alone and\\nthe walls are closing in. German snipers are beginning\\nto infiltrate his lines and he has fewer than 2000\\nutterly exhausted men left. Saturday morning a brief truce is declared and 1200 wounded British\\nand Polish soldiers are taken prisoner. We did not get our final bridgehead and that must be admitted,\\nGeneral Bernard Montgomery. A small number of men from\\nthe 30th core, manages to reach Driel and\\nestablishes a connection with what\\'s left of the first airborne while 300 more Poles\\nmake it across the river and attack boats. All of this is too little, too late. Allied commanders are no longer\\ndiscussing the possibility of reinforcement, their\\nonly hope is evacuation. Under the cover of darkness, and artillery fire, the\\nfirst airborne division and their polish allies make their way across the Rhine and back to safety. All told, 1741 of the 10,000 men dropped as part of the first airborne division make it back to Allied territory. So, what went wrong? Basically everything, even the weather. As we\\'ve already mentioned,\\nthe airborne troops were ill equipped to\\nface armored divisions stationed in the area and\\nthe Germans seemed to know exactly where to place their defenders. That problem was compounded by the fact that the British army lacked the aircraft to drop the first airborne all at once, you tend to lose the element\\nof surprise when you have to drop your men into the\\nsame spot over multiple days. Members of the Dutch\\nunderground provided warnings about the 99th panzers but\\nmay have also compromised the operation from the start. The Germans as a whole\\nwere also being commanded by a renowned defensive strategist Field Marshal Walter Model, who was able to oversea his forces from\\nhis HQ in Arnheim itself. As for Allied command,\\nhistorians tend to focus on Lieutenant General Frederick Browning, who was in charge of the\\nfirst Allied airborne army but their focus was not\\none born out of admiration but rather of sharp criticism. In fact many historians as\\nwell as General John Frost point to him as bearing\\nat least some of the blame for why the operation went downhill. Rather than any one issue in particular, a number of factors had\\nto go wrong all at once for Market Garden to fail\\nas spectacularly as it did. Among these problems were the placement of the first airbornes drop\\nzone too far from Arnhem Bridge. It\\'s communication black\\nout, the 24 hour delay of the 30th corp, the decision at Nijmegen to delay the capture of the Waal Bridge by several hours after\\nlanding, ultimately delaying the 30th corp even further and relentlessly unfavorable weather. None the less, Market Garden\\nwas not a complete failure at least according to the\\nmemoirs of Bernard Montgomery published 14 years later. - I knew myself you see and that was a. - Did you ever lose a\\nbattle Field Marshal? - No, (laughs) - [Interviewer] That\\'s the\\nimportant thing isn\\'t it?

       " \" hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian today's video north africa 1942 this video is brought to you by war thunder more on that later by the end of 1941 the allies had rapidly pushed ax's forces west along the north african coast hoping to finally capture the elusive irwin rammel at betta falm instead he once again escaped and dug in at el a gala where the brits presumed he would assume a defensive posture general claude auchenlack believed that rommel's forces were too depleted by the events of the previous year to launch a meaningful counter-attack he and his staff had badly miscalculated on january 21 1942 the germans launched a punishing counter-attack that pushed the british 8th army out of almost all of the territory that they had recaptured as part of operation crusader during the first weeks of february axis forces swept east through cerenaica while the british retreated again and again on february 6 the front lines finally stabilized some 60 kilometers west of to brook as rommel was once again hamstrung by his need for reinforcements the eighth army under the command of lieutenant general neil richie who my artist just still hasn't had enough time to draw formed a defensive line from the gezawa inlet in the north to ber hakim the awk under strong pressure from prime minister winston churchill ordered richie to attack however our favorite stick figure was worried that the axis forces would again sweep south of any new incursion as a compromise the plan for the upcoming operation buckshot called for reserve units to be positioned to the center and south behind a leading force before it could even begin however richie was proven right on the evening of may 26th the africa corps 21st panzer 15th panzer and 90th light infantry divisions swung south while four italian divisions remained to oppose the gaza line the attacking force annihilated richie's reserve units but in a turn of events that should surprise absolutely nobody who's been watching this series insufficient fuel and ammunition once again stifled formal's attack unable to finish their march to the sea the now isolated axis divisions took a defensive position at a location they called the cauldron on may 29th during the first week of june the allies launched air and groud assaults against the cauldron for a moment it seemed like rommel might be encircled but on june 1st his panzers managed to break through to their west and reunite with the remaining italians watching the gazala line crumble richie ordered the 13th and 30th court to retreat to egypt leaving only the thousand man second south african division at to brooke once again the allies fled east and once again the port city was in the crosshairs of the desert fox in order to capture that vital port which had so long eluded him rommel knew he would need a formidable supply of both fuel and ammunition his hungry gaze fell upon the allied airfield at camphurt where the raf had been dropping supplies for british ground forces that proverbial henhouse stored all of the eggs he could ever won bolstered by what he had taken at the raf supply drop ramo attacked the city once again on the evening of the 20th this time rather than nine months the siege lasted barely a day it was the worst british military defeat since the fall of singapore and was seen as especially humiliating due to the speed with which it was obtained in recognition of his foresight before the battle of gezalla we at the armchair historian team have finally commissioned a portrait of neil richie and in recognition of his defeat the awk fired him maybe we shouldn't have invested in his portrait after all the awk took direct control of the 8th army on the 25th but couldn't stop the africa corps from sweeping aside the defenders at mrsa matra with the resupply depot at to brooke finally in hand it seemed that axis forces were on the cusp of victory and for his victory at to brooke rommel was promoted to field marshal cairo the center of power in the region since the day of the romans was barely 200 miles away the suez canal the all-important jugular vein of the british empire was within striking distance all that remained in the way was a little railroad station by the sea called el alamein and the battered british army defending it the new field marshal saw no reason to let this impediment stand possibly riding the high of his incredible successes rommel either overestimated the resilience of his own forces or underestimated that of the defenders his exhausted men were moving towards the end of their newly extended supply lines moreover finally learning from the german's use of the 88 millimeter anti-aircraft cannon to punch through tanks at long range the british defenders mustered a massive artillery barrage from every gun available rommel's tanks were especially vulnerable to this bombardment because they had been channeled into a narrow corridor between the sea and the katara depression an area of desert with especially difficult terrain that made it impassable for mechanized forces fighting was intense but ultimately the allied position held at the cost of more than thirteen thousand lives the ninth australian division counter-attacked following the artillery bombardment and pushed the germans back securing the awk his last victory in the desert campaign but the prime minister had become impatient with the ox suggested timetable for offensive operations which were set to begin in early september this was likely due in part to churchill's knowledge that a new front was about to open up in west africa without a swift victory in egypt and libya the planned invasion might face disaster during a handful of meetings in london that july plans for operation torch a massive anglo-american landing in northwest africa had been finalized fearing that any hesitation might jeopardize the plan the prime minister sacked the dawdling awk as commander-in-chief for the middle east and acting commander of the 8th army taking his place as second in command in the middle east was general harold alexander who had commanded the first corps at dunkirk for command of the eighth army bernard al montgomery was chosen there will be no more bellyaching and no more retreats he intended to go on the attack but ironically the meticulous general spent even more time preparing than the awk had requested that left the ball in rommel's court but when he again tried to break through on the night of august 30th this time at alum el halfa ridge the africa corps was met with heavy minefields and air attacks on september 2nd with fuel yet again being the limited factor axis forces retreated once more the field marshal's seemingly unstoppable advance had well and truly stumbled for the next seven weeks montgomery gathered strength and reinforcements when he launched a massive attack on october 23rd he had 1230 medium tanks ready to be deployed rommel was down to just 210. of the allied tanks 500 were new american sherman and grant tanks as good or better than anything the axis had except the panzer iv of which rommel had only 23. the offensive was costly and the artillery fire tore tanks apart on both sides but montgomery was able to slowly wedge the 8th army into the german italian position landmines that rommel had planted to his rear and the anti-tank guns that now surrounded the british on three sides meant that the desert fox was killing four tanks for every one that he lost nonetheless his enemies numerical and logistical advantage was overwhelming by the evening of november 2nd the africa corps had just 30 tanks in operating condition when the field marshal signaled a retreat adolf hitler was furious he told rommel to hold his position at all costs but the battle was lost and the fuhrer's anger wouldn't change that the hurried withdrawal left the allies in a favorable position the italian divisions

during the whole American Revolution fighting in the Orthodox formations every part of what I just read is flat-out wrong and the funny thing is that outside of the context of the American Revolution we rarely see historians make the same claim that got us on the armchair historian team wondering was Britain's 18th century Army really the best Great Britain's position as a military power isn't really up to debate but as an island nation its greatest military asset was the awe-inspiring Royal Navy to assess how the army measured up we'll be looking at a handful of specific categories leadership and logistics training size and finally its actual record in warfare we're also going to be comparing the British with some of the other European great powers at the time especially France and Prussia which some military historians refer to as the gold standard of 18th century armies with all of that said let's begin with our first category leadership leadership within the British Army was like in other nations at the time largely dominated by wealth commissions had to be purchased and the going rate was not cheap usually only wealthy landowners could afford to buy commissions so it was not an especially meritocratic system while offering leadership positions on the basis of wealth wasn't unusual it certainly wasn't beneficial for British leadership for much of the 18th century no formal training institution existed for British army officers nor was military experience required to purchase a commission just a recommendation from a major or higher however some of the officers on the ground did receive an education the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich was opened in 1741 but it only trained officers in the engineering and artillery Corps compare this to the contemporary Prussian Army which opened its first major officer cadet school the cadet in house in 1716 now let's take a look at the army structure the organisation of the British Army was kind of a mess there were a number of Divisional Commanders with one commander-in-chief to preside over the entirety of the army a position that was often vacant when someone actually did hold the job they were often preoccupied by conflicts all over the world for instance Jeffery Amherst a man I doubt you've ever heard of was in charge during the American Revolution and had to juggle another half dozen simultaneous or near simultaneous conflicts in which Britain was embroiled in the absence of any overall organizational direction individual generals high-ranking civilian diplomats and even corporate interests like the British East India Company had enormous control over troop deployment and strategy with so many different people exercising or trying to exercise power there was very little cohesion what's more artillery Gunners and engineers technically weren't even part of the army instead they took orders from the board of ordnance with their own ranks organization supplies and medical services the Army's bureaucratic tangle was a nightmare of incoherence insufficiently undone by mediocre leaders as a result it proved difficult to coordinate on a large scale and logistics frequently had to be handled on a local level more often than not commanders had to finance their own units while abroad and would only be reimbursed later nonetheless Britain made up for this shortcoming in the training of its common soldiers which was rather impressive before they ever saw battle new recruits were thoroughly drilled in accordance with impressive command managers such as those written by John Churchill Duke of Marlborough the quality and standardization of this training helped establish the British Army's reputation for being able to turn any man into an effective soldier troops were highly disciplined and lapses were often punished harshly with penalties including flogging branding and even execution for repeated deserters that strictness did wonders for discipline but often did the opposite for morale which proved to be a long-running problem for the army that was predictably an even bigger problem among those who were forced to join military service was also often used as a punishment for certain crimes though is convicted of public drunkenness vagrancy and unpaid debt were frequently conscripted press gangs were not uncommon and their proliferation was actually one of the causes for the war of 1812 with the United States still the level of discipline of British soldiers was undeniably impressive even if many of the people that served in it did so begrudgingly Redcoats could hold a line and maintain an impressive rate of fire on par with the best armies in the world and just about anyone could be trained to be one of them before we move on it is important to note that the 18th century featured a prolific amount of global conflicts because of this British military discipline and leadership quality had many troughs and Peaks depending on when or where the war was fought the last factor we'll talk about today is the Army's overall size during the 18th century the British Army had around 120,000 to 150,000 soldiers at its peak and 45,000 at its lowest that's compared to the peak of 200,000 that the Prussians had at its disposal or the 130,000 that the French had toward the turn of the century while that many redcoats sounds impressive let's consider the fact that neither of those countries had an empire that compared to the size of Great Britain especially after the Seven Years War thus mercenary groups usually German ones were often relied upon to supplement troop numbers in the American Revolutionary War alone 37% of the 78,000 British troops that fought in the Americas were German mercenaries but everything we've discussed here today hardly means a thing if we don't look at the actual record of British successes and failures on the battlefield the British fought 6 major Wars during the 18th century and won just three of them maybe four depending on who you ask before we get to our final conclusion a word from our sponsor Nord VPN many people neglect online privacy but since we're living

fact considering the excellent New Model Army of the 17th century the performance of Britain's ground forces was comparatively lackluster the Navy on the other hand was quite reasonably always seen as absolutely vital to British national security and thus better maintained so our conclusion is that Britain's army was not the finest in the world during the 18th century but it didn't need to be the thriving global Empire Britain was building relied heavily on its Navy and more often than not its ground forces faced non-european foes with poorly organised and technologically backward militaries and if Britain couldn't conquer the foe in question using its army it could utilize its superior Navy to isolate and starve her enemy atactic that continued to be used for much of britain's history

       " \" This video is sponsored by the armchair historian website more on that later Today we're going to talk about the unsuccessful American invasion of Canada. The first one let's start with some context in 1763 the British Empire emerged victorious against France in the Seven Years War Suddenly the British found themselves with a large number of ethnically French citizens in their new Canadian colony Because of the French Canadians dubious loyalties the American Continental Congress sent a letter as early as May 29th 1775 writing the following to the oppressed inhabitants of Canada Join with us in the defense of our common Liberty They were flatly ignored just when Congress had all but given up Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold the two commanders who had captured Fort Ticonderoga in northern, New York Pleaded to the Congress to launch an invasion further north So it was decided on June 27th that a force would be sent to capture Montreal in the West and Quebec in the East the British perception of their Canadian subjects was also misguided General Guy Carleton was so certain that he could recruit a new regiment of French Canadians that he sent two battalions of his standing Garrison to reinforce general gage in Boston during the summer of 1775 in the coming months he eventually realized that he had overestimated the French Canadians loyalty to the crown and was unable to Successfully raise a new regiment to protect Quebec the Continental Congress saw this moment as the perfect opportunity to strike They dispatched Brigadier General Richard Montgomery to seize Montreal and make his way east How they expected to do this with just seventeen hundred men is beyond me WJ would author of battles of the American Revolutionary War 1775 to 1783 other problems with the impending invasion Unexpectedly rough terrain the forces of nature and the abilities of general Guy Carleton governor of Canada and commander of the British forces Montgomery began his expedition by making his way north to Lake Champlain But was stopped on September 16th at fort st. Joan's which was garrisoned by 725 British red on November 2nd The fort was captured and nothing stood in the way of Montgomery's path to Montreal once he had made it there He used a similar strategy surrounding it by landing a forest north of the city. It was the infilling that Washington could only dream of Carleton who commanded the garrison abandoned the city and was almost captured in his escape on November 13th the city fell just a month prior in September George Washington gave Colonel Benedict Arnold one of the earliest advocates of the Canadian invasion orders to march to Quebec with 1,100 men and rendezvous with Montgomery who did not have enough men on his own to successfully besieged, Quebec City Arnold and his men had to put up with grueling conditions on their Trek up north and with highly inaccurate maps - By the time they arrived on November 9th only 600 men remained with no cannon and inadequate equipment The well-equipped British defenders. Meanwhile numbered some 1,800 men luckily Montgomery arrived just in time to take command on December 2nd with over 300 fresh troops Munitions food and captured British uniforms 8 days later the cannon that Montgomery had brought with him were set up But they couldn't even put a dent in Quebec Stick walls Furthermore the ice-covered ground made digging trenches and defensive structures nearly impossible And only 20 days remained before his men's enlistments expired Montgomery had to act fast on the night of December 27th under the cover of snow fall colonial troops Prepared to launch their assault but just as the attack was to commence the clouds cleared and moonlight revealed all of the Americans positions Forcing Montgomery to call the attack off by then only four days remained before the bulk of his army would head home To make matters worse one of Montgomery's sergeants who had deserted revealed to general Carleton all of his plans Thus a new scheme was concocted to launch a pincer movement into these supposedly weaker sides of the city while two diversionary Forces attacked the city center on the night of December 30th Just a day before the men's enlistments expired a blizzard rolled in it was Montgomery's last chance to launch the attack At 2:00 a.m. He ordered his men to assume their positions Montgomery first made his way south to the plains of Abraham and began moving his men among the snow-covered Bank of the st. Lawrence River Montgomery assumed that he had the element of surprise and being the inspiring leader He was took 17 of his men and rushed to capture a British redoubt that he thought was undefended unbeknownst to Montgomery this was one of the most heavily fortified positions of Carlton's line of defense as Montgomery and his men broke into a sprint Cannon and men appeared seemingly out of nowhere And delivered a volley straight into the incoming room Montgomery was killed instantly by grapeshot and those that accompanied him ran the other way as Montgomery's men retreated back to their camp Arnold had no idea what fate befell them He and his men had set off at 4:00 a.m And successfully snuck past an artillery outpost beyond the palace gate But some time after his men were discovered - and promptly fired upon under a barrage of bullets Arnold and his men made their way into the streets and scrambled for cover in Preparation for a charge against the first barricade Arnold stood up and you guessed it led the charge himself He was luckier than Montgomery though and bullet struck him in the leg Incapacitating him for the rest of the battle But he was taken to safety by those around him instead of retrieving his men elected a new leader captain, Daniel Morgan Morgan did exactly what you'd expect leading another charge against the British He was the luckiest of these three commanders Successfully capturing a British captain and his men with only a graze on his cheek and a bullet hole in his hat The Lowertown was now open and undefended but Morgan stopped to consult with his officers before assaulting it They had captured a hundred and fifty prisoners and could not proceed without risking overextension Thus Morgan's officers convinced him to stop there and wait for Montgomery to rendezvous with them after which time they could continue the attack as we know Montgomery had been killed by then so after an hour of waiting Morgan decided to continue the attack, however Carlton had used this lapse in the fighting to direct his men to strategic positions on the walls Surrounding colonial forces seeing that he had been outplayed Morgan ordered a retreat but the British had already covered his rear He was now trapped and being fired on by all sides his men dropping all around him at 9:00 a.m He turned over his sword surrendering himself and about four hundred and thirty of his troops at the end of the day sixty Americans had been killed and 34 wounded compared to five British soldiers killed and 13 wounded in the aftermath of this disastrous incursion the defeated Arnold found his way back to the remnants of Montgomery's Men and together they held out for winter with drooping spirits any Hope of spreading the revolution to Canada had died with Montgomery but even if Quebec had Successfully been taken it remains doubtful whether the Patriots had the resources and men to maintain it in May 1776 the Patriots finally gave it up when British General John Burgoyne landed with 4000 reinforcements Arnold was the last American to leave Canada On June 18th still hungry for a victory Thanks for watching If you want to gain full access to this series which will cover nearly every battle of the American Revolution you can go to the armchair historian dot-com go to join and sign up for as little as $4 for your first month If you're one of the first 30 people to use my promo code Revolution those who pay for the premium membership will also be able to request their own lecture videos every few months Which all members will be able to view and the best part is is that no videos on the website will have ads or sponsorships We shall take your castle by force Meudon Franken ass You\",\n",
       " \" hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian today's video the north african campaign part two [Music] on february 12 1941 a 50 year old renowned tank commander and veteran of the first world war stepped off of a german transport plane into the arid desert air this man was none other than irwin rommel relatively short with a solemn look he was the son and grandson of schoolteachers and he looked the part or perhaps more like the principal however this man who would come to be called the desert fox was not just a scholar of infantry tactics he was one of germany's most well-respected battlefield tacticians his image has been somewhat sanitized by both wartime and post-war propaganda and so it is worth remembering that rommel was one of adolf hitler's personal favorites he was here on behalf of the fuhrer to clean up mussolini's mess during our research for this episode we found the full english translation of erwin rommel's 1937 military classic infantry

onwards to africa operation compass the code name for the first allied military operation of the western desert campaign had been an enormous success for the british thanks to general sir archibald weivel and his subordinate richard o'connor however the allies winning streak was about to come to an end on february 9 winston churchill ordered the sixth australian division to cross the mediterranean and join the allied defense of greece at nearly the same moment that germany's newly created africa corps began deploying in libya since the british did not expect a counter-attack in libya most of the 7th armored division returned to egypt to defend her majesty's holdings there as a result when erwin ramo arrived with 65 000 german troops in addition to the 55 000 italians already present he was able to bring a 120 000 man hammer down on the dangerously strung out allies in the entirety of the middle east theater wavel had around 118 000 men under his command as part of the newly reformed 8th army they were supported by a large quantity of aircraft and the superior british navy however the british forces over extension meant that they were unprepared for the concentrated axis assault despite ramos orders to take a defensive stance until more reinforcements arrived in may of 1941 the ambitious commander took action after remarkably easy early offensive victories at al aguilar and merced brega before long he put the german plans for operation zone bloomer or sunflower into action early our historian friend from the last episode stephen w sears notes that the army that faced rommel was not the fast-moving quick thinking force that had chased marshall graziani out of egypt the desert rats of the seventh armored division had been replaced by the newly arrived second armored division and the sixth australian division was relieved by another australian division untrained and poorly equipped like o'connor did before him rommel split his forces in an attempt to cut the enemy off ordering some troops to take the coastal route and ordering others to go through cerenaica as for o'connor himself in an almost inconceivable blunder the british officer's unescorted staff car took a wrong turn and drove right into axis forces he and his intended replacement philip neem along with john coombe the man who ambushed the retreating italian army in 1940 were captured and wevel was down three of his most experienced senior officers by mid-april benghazi had fallen and nearly all of the british forces in libya had been successfully pushed back to egypt with one notable exception those at brook this fortified position was held by the remnants of the australian 9th and 7th divisions along with several divisions of english and commonwealth artillery who had fled there during rommel's initial advance one of the recurring themes in this series is the difficulty of keeping troops supplied in a huge desert battlefield like north africa to quote steven sears once more as marshall graziani had ruefully noted desert war imposed its own special rules rule number one was that armies brought with them everything they needed there was no such thing as living off the country rama would need to brook as a resupply port to have any chance of pushing into egypt thus began a seemingly endless siege of the isolated allied position surrounded on three sides the 23 000 manned garrison was assisted and supplied by the royal navy but lacked air support becoming the frequent target of luftwaffe raids the germans and italians sent wave after wave of troops against the australians but the defenses of dubrook had been bolstered into a fortress royal engineers created a 30-mile semi-circle of trenches and hardened defensive structures peppered in were lengths of barbed wire tank traps and land mines without the reinforcements it seemed that rommel would not be able to root out the troublesome aussies on his flank and would have to be content with containing them spring saw numerous advances on either side that were quickly repelled first among them was the aptly named operation brevity which only lasted from may 15th to the 16th british forces made slight gains that were nearly immediately undone by axis counter-attacks those incursions culminated with axis forces seizing the choke point at hellfire pass on may 26th and the 27th but were unable to move any further as summer was nearing wavel received reinforcements as part of another operation codenamed tiger a daring mission that saw 238 tanks ferried across the mediterranean in relatively slow vulnerable merchant ships protected by a royal navy escort to be fair to wavel as supreme commander of all british forces in the middle east his troops had to contend not just with ramos africa corps but also with the remaining italians in east africa local rebellions in their oil-rich colonial holdings in iraq and the threat of axis troops landing in vichy french syria and lebanon what's more he was also responsible for overseeing the key allied defensive positions in the mediterranean such as crete and malta if the desert campaign really was the game of chess contemporary military strategists thought it was huevel was playing three games at once against three different opponents on june 15th huevo launched operation battle axe a british and indian offensive intended to push the german forces out of halfaya pass with the ultimate goal of relieving to brook and it proved no more successful than past attempts and was called off after just two days the frustrated churchill relieved wavel three weeks later and replaced him with the commander-in-chief of india clawed the awk akanlak on july 5th sears notes from the failure of battle axe the british concluded that their tanks were outgunned by those of the enemy when in most cases the actual killers were the anti-tank guns particularly the 88 flag the failure to appreciate the full value of the anti-tank gun was to haunt the british in months to come the awk spent the next few months resupplying and regrouping while rommel tried in vain to overwhelm the australian garrison into brook the aussies had no problem standing their ground presumably because everything back home in australia tries to kill you anyways the royal navy continued to resupply them under the cover of darkness and in september they were successfully rotated out of the city taking their place was the british 70th division the polish carpathian brigade and the czechoslovak 11th infantry battalion this mixed allied force would hold the city for the rest of the siege in november british reinforcements joined with those from india sudan south africa and new zealand swelling the aux forces and prompting him to initiate operation crusader by this point the awk had about 700 tanks comprising crusaders matildas and the american lent least tank the steward rommel had just 390 tanks mainly comprising panzer 3s and panzer 4s despite what battlefield 5 might tell you there were no tigers present in 1941. the operation which the awk had placed under the command of lieutenant general alan cunningham commenced on november 18th with a push into solemn and bardia while the british south africans and indians besieged the axis forces there the new zealanders moved north to relief to brooke on the 21st a detachment of british and south african troops were dispatched to attack sidi raziq but were cut off and nearly destroyed when rommel cut between those units in the north and the ones still fighting at salem and bartia the new zealanders did manage to reach cd rezieg by november 25th and make contact with the garrison at brook on the 30th however the units that were supposed to support them were so badly beaten that cunningham urged the awk to let them retreat in response cunningham was fired and replaced with general neil ritchie truth be told the british went through commanders so quickly that my artist couldn't keep up with drawing them so here's a stick figure one of my writers drew the new zealanders now experiencing heavy fighting on all sides were ultimately unable to liberate to brook and withdrew back to egypt on december 1st however as rommel was never able to take to brooke he could only be resupplied from tripoli and even then only one third of his intended materials survived the royal navy's interdictions once more british forces had been consistently reinforced throughout the year while the german campaign in russia and the balkans diverted any available access manpower away from north africa after a failed attempt to relieve the dangerously isolated italian garrisons at solemn and bardia the axis forces were forced to retreat as they were out of supplies

unfortunately the desert fox slipped out of their grasp under the cover of darkness on christmas eve ramo officially began adapting to the harsh desert battlefield and the next year would bring some of his greatest victories yet the seeds of his destruction had already been sown on december 11th one day after the liberation of to brook and four days after the japanese attack on pearl harbor

global conflict that would become known as the war to end all wars had just begun and Germany found itself fighting on two fronts but they were well-prepared they had the Schlieffen Plan their

while Russia sat around and watched while Russia's vast and rugged terrain insufficient industrial capacity and lack of infrastructure would severely hamper its ability to mobilize Russia's sorry excuse for a railway system made its railway cars completely incompatible with Germany's which would further inhibit the speed of Russian forces when they reached German territory on the way there the Russians would also have to heavily rely on horses because of poor roads preventing the usage of trucks not that they had many of those in the first place in addition Russian communication lines were extremely vulnerable to interception the Germans cracked the Russians coded radio messages shortly after the outbreak of the conflict and even though the Russians caught on and developed a new code it proved difficult to provide each Russian commander with a new code book thus the Russians resorted to desperately broadcasting their messages on the radio without implementing the new code hoping that the Germans would somehow miss them what the Germans did miss was the czars covert order to begin partial mobilization three days before the outbreak of the war many of these troops had been assembled from the western reaches of the Russian Empire and were therefore already at Germany's doorstep as the Russian 1st army under general paul von brennan kampf and the second army under general alexander samsonov marched towards Konigsberg a stepping stone to Berlin the Germans realized that they would have to contend with the Russian Menace far sooner than they had expected - after the German defeat at Gumba ninh in mid-august it was even suggested that east prussia be completely abandoned the russian armies in the region totaled some 500,000 men whereas the German Eighth Army now under the command of the once retired general paul von hindenburg and his chief of staff general erich ludendorff numbered some 200,000 men things looked grim for the germans until a cunning strategy was devised to prevent the russians from taking Konigsberg Samsonov's ii army and renting comps first army had become separated by the vast Missourian lakes after the former army stopped to resupply this meant that the Germans could divide and conquer taking on one army at a time without being encircled Hindenburg decided to focus most of his attention on the advancing Second Army a more pressing threat due to its proximity to Konigsberg he sent a sizable detachment southward under command of Herman von Francois to face them a smaller force was sent in the direction of the 1st army to deter the possibility of Renan Kampf ending the resupply process early and interrupting the attack on Samsonov's troops in late August the 8th army detachment Hindenburg had sent south caught up with the Second Army which luckily for the Germans had been slowed down due to a combination of rough terrain and supply shortages the battle was about to begin but before we delve into the details of what exactly took place we should first compare the opposing forces to gauge their strengths and weaknesses first let's talk RAM troops the Russian army was composed of mostly new and inexperienced troops whereas the German rank-and-file were professionalized according to a strict Prussian military doctrine meaning that they had underwent yearly drills and rigorous training exercises during peacetime in preparation for this moment now let's talk weapons while the Russian soldiers in the 1st and 2nd Army's didn't laugh guns they did lack ammunition because of stretched supply lines as for weapon types both German and Russian forces were equipped with variants of the Maxim machine gun the primary rifle used by the Russians was the most Nagant whereas for the German it was the Gewehr 98 German riflemen were better off than Russian riflemen if only because of the fact that they were equipped with more ammunition with regards to artillery even though the Russians had nearly doubled the amount of artillery pieces than its German counterpart the Russians were hindered by the fact that their artillery wasn't always distributed evenly allowing the Germans to outgun them with better organized and more mobile batteries furthermore every German division had a true battalion of cutting-edge 105 millimeter field howitzers which were superior to anything the Russians could field as for leadership the German military clung to an aristocratic tradition that bred disciplined world-class commanders who often had combat experience Russian officers by contrast we're the subject of ridicule aimed at a perceived lack of logistical and organizational ability based on the terrible communication and lack of reconnaissance at Tannenberg this ridicule was rightfully deserved the Russian military also had an aristocratic tradition but it did not produce the same effects when the Tsar's first cousin once removed the Grand Duke Nicholas was named commander-in-chief of the army he had no clue what to do with such a massive force on such short notice allegedly he wept when he learned of his appointment to make matters worse samsonov and fond Renan Kampf who were actually decent commanders were unable to effectively work together because the two absolutely despised one another their feud goes back to the 1905 Battle of Mactan during the russo-japanese war when samsonov publicly shamed Renan Kampf for the Russian defeat this feud was well known and did not escape the ears of max Hoffman staff officer of the 8th German army Hoffman had served in the russo-japanese war as an observer and knew full well of the extent of the Russian generals hatred for one another indeed he knew how to exploit it across the board Germany had distinct advantages over the Russians with the only exception being sheared and power and a seemingly infinite supply of vodka in addition to all of the affer mentioned advantages the Germans seemed to have luck on their side too the detachment under the command of von Francois against orders held back instead of attacking immediately his commanders weren't pleased Ludendorff was utterly fuming Hoffmann however convinced his commanders to trust Francois another detachment of the 8th army which had been in retreat against the Second Army was now engaged by Samsonov who thought he had the upper hand but on August 27th Hoffman's trust was rewarded as von Francois and his men struck Samsonov's left flank in a surprise attack the assault sent the Russians into a retreat after this engagement von Francois once again disobeyed his orders this time venturing further east than he was supposed to in an effort to encircle the Second Army on his own on August 29th von Francois and his men joined by two other detachments caught Samsonov off guard yet again seeing this Hindenburg promptly ordered an encirclement of the Russian troops to which the Russian Grand Duke responded by ordering von grunen Kampf to come to Samsonov's aid and of course they didn't make it in time whether this was intentional or not is up to debate as samsonov was being attacked on all sides his command post only offered a view of his army center column which was attacking a seemingly weak German position samsonov had little to no visibility of his flanks which as a fer mentioned were being brutally hit by the Germans had he known this he could have dispatched men from the center column to relieve his flanks were withdrawn from the battlefield with most of his men left standing only a day later the second army surrendered to the Germans after being completely enveloped and Samsonov rather than face the Czar's wrath straight deep into the forest and took his own life since the first army was never more than about 70 miles away from the Second Army during this time the Germans eventually caught up to von Renan Kampf and defeated him - at the Battle of the missourian Lakes the Grand Duke had no choice but to recall his remaining forces for his role in repelling the Russians Hindenburg became a national hero and was promoted to Field Marshal he and Ludendorff basically called the shots for the rest of the war and after it concluded Hindenburg went on to become president of the vemma republic von Francois was deservedly given the nickname of the Fox and Hoffman sadly got little recognition by comparison the Russian army never really recovered from this defeat and the situation only worsened for the Tsar from then on [Music] you\",\n",

recognized as president and bringing an end to the bloodshed in mexico forever except that wasn't the end of it see during the civil war both sides borrowed a lot of money from spain france and great britain when the liberals won these powers expected them to pay compensation not only for the money that they borrowed but for the money the conservatives also borrowed the liberals weren't enthusiastic about the idea to say the least so the european powers decided that they would seize their recompense instead the plan was simple strong-arm mexico into paying for the wall that's not right strong-armed mexico into paying for the war but napoleon iii had other plans after all he had a lot to live up to his intention was not to simply collect debts but to take over all of mexico and to do that he would need a monarch who would serve as his puppet that's precisely where archduke maximilian comes in a habsburg who had been approached by mexican monarchists before and could claim to be the rightful ruler of the now defunct territory in new spain in december 1861 the european coalition comprising france great britain and spain captured veracruz with little to no resistance exact numbers are hard to come by but we believe that the invading force numbered some 6 000 men whereas the mexican army could only field some 3 000 men at the time with such a hefty numerical advantage the europeans crept ever closer to mexico city capturing three cities along the way then seemingly out of nowhere another french fleet arrived capturing campeche in february 1862 that cleared the way for an entirely new french army to land in april under the command of general charles de lorenze this army came not to collect debt but to begin the conquest of the country napoleon iii had thereby revealed his hand and the british and spanish decided that they would have none of it i mean did you really expect that the french and british would be able to work together by the end of the month only french troops remained on mexican soil france had to secure its precarious position while reinforcements were shipped across the atlantic so it concluded a ceasefire with mexico but lorenzo had other plans he initiated a series of skirmishes after which he laid siege to the city of puebla the mexican general zaragoza had about four and a half thousand men at his disposal stationed in a well-fortified position on two hills just northeast of the city general de la renze had six thousand men he immediately ordered a headlong attack against puebla from the north which was repelled de lorenze then attacked again bolstering his numbers by committing his reserves and orchestrating a diversionary attack on the eastern part of the city both attacks were initially more successful than the first but they were repelled all the same nevertheless de la renze ordered a third attack an ill-fated one as his artillery was out of ammunition it was a complete disaster now it was zeragosa's turn it's the climactic counter-attack you've been waiting for with the french being attacked on both flanks simultaneously by the mexican cavalry and charged head-on by the infantry the festival of cinco de mayo is actually meant to celebrate this victory not mexican independence but the war was not won yet on the eastern coast of mexico the french expanded their foothold until the end of 1862. when zaragoza died the french returned to puebla under a different general ellie frederick foray he was in less of a hurry to take it and in march 1863 he besieged the city with 26 000 men after a grueling two-month siege the defenders despite several relief efforts and sortie attempts were forced to surrender in may 1863 the road to mexico city now lay open to the french in may juarez and the mexican government took flight from the capital and made for chihuahua one week later on june 7 1863 french troops stormed mexico city the second phase of the french conquest of mexico had now begun installing maximilian and keeping him in power to convince him to take the crown napoleon provided him with results from a rigged election he accepted the crown in october of that same year and began working on a series of progressive reforms making the country more open to democracy abolishing a mexican form of serfdom ending child labor and even limiting work hours mexican conservatives lent him tepid support french and imperial mexican forces remained victorious on the battlefield until the end of 1865 taking a number of cities and asserting control over sinaloa and jualisco their advance stalled thereafter and in 1866 juarez's republican forces made a startlingly fast comeback armed with american dollars and weapons up to that point americans had been busy fighting the bloodiest war in their history but now that the united states were united once more they were more than willing to enforce the monroe doctrine and thereby defend their southern border from european imperialists napoleon iii was prudent enough to begin withdrawing troops deciding that mexico was not worth the damage to franco-american relations by the end of 1866 maximilian had been abandoned after fleeing mexico city and being besieged in k retaro for a few months the habsburg prince who had traveled the atlantic expecting to be welcomed with open arms as the bridge between the old world and new was captured by mexican forces his execution took place a month later resulting in the restoration of a republican juarez government in the end of french intervention in mexico if you want to learn more

       " \" we're very excited to announce that today's video is sponsored by audible more on that later [Music] you're probably already familiar with the iconic normandy landings but chances are you're more familiar with the experiences of those who landed on the beaches as opposed to that of the defenders and this is fairly understandable as military historian robert m citino puts it the d-day landings have become one of the allies great historical epics whereas for the opposite side the romance vanishes leaving the uninspiring spectacle of a once proud military force no longer up to the challenge as one can expect this leaves any military history enthusiast short on information about the axis perspective in this battle to be absolutely clear our intent is not to sympathize with the nazi regime its supporters or its ideology we are simply interested in uncovering the human element of the less talked about side in this near mythological clash first we'll need to provide context before discussing the landings at normandy the confrontation on the atlantic shoreline was long in the coming as early as autumn of 1943 hitler had gathered his chiefs of staff and told them that all signs point to an offensive against the western front no later than spring 1944 but spring passed and the allies had yet to strike making the atmosphere for the germans almost unbearably tense it didn't help that field marshals von runestet and rommel the two men charged with protecting the atlantic coast fundamentally disagreed over the issue of tank placement rommel knew that because the luftwaffe was occupied on the eastern front keeping panzer divisions stationed inland as van roonstedt ordered them to do was folly the north african campaign taught him that without air superiority moving tanks across the countryside was a near impossible task the german soldiers meanwhile did the only thing they could do to mask their apprehension they made jokes one went something like if you see a black plane it's british if you see a white plane it's american when you see nothing at all it's the luftwaffe the others among them who were polish georgian and soviet prisoners impressed into nazi service called the ostigun probably weren't in the mood for making jokes having been dragged hundreds of miles away from their home countries they along with the german soldiers who had been wounded in action made up a significant portion of soldiers stationed on the atlantic coast by the time the invasion broke out some of these troops had not been fed for several days one soldier paul goats who was only 17 at the time recalls the following i hadn't had any food or water for three days so around 6am i walked to a village and begged for milk the french there knew me but this time they said go away the allies already landed with tanks it seems that at this juncture the french no longer felt the need to be as friendly to their occupiers to make matters worse for the german side they lacked not only food and supplies but directive in the immediate lead-up to d-day having been convinced that the allies wouldn't dare cross the channel in june because of poor weather conditions rommel had gone home to celebrate his wife's birthday and to subsequently meet with hitler von roonstedt opted not to disturb rommel because of his mistaken belief that the paratrooper landings which took place on june 5th a day before the naval invasion were a ploy to distract the germans from the real allied target kalei by the time rommel arrived on the evening of june 6 it was too late all five of the landing sites the allies selected were secured operation fortitude the allied deception strategy had done its work now that we understand the lead up to this momentous event let's take a look at the normandy landings through the german soldiers perspective the location we'll be evaluating in this video is codenamed utah beach it is one of the five landing sites that the allies chose for their invasion in the months preceding the landing the soldiers stationed there had been busy at work erecting gun emplacements and setting up stakes tripods barbed wire and land mines streams had been damned and the floodgates of the duve were open to flood the land behind the beach as another deterrent such obstacles would not have been present in normandy if erwin rommel hadn't learned from ax's mistakes at the allied landings at salerno italy in 1943. how many times must the german soldier have laid awake at night questioning themselves would it all be enough it was on a night like this around midnight that over 2 000 allied bombers began wreaking havoc on the coast the effectiveness of the bombing raid on the night of june 5th is disputable but unlike bombing raids of the past there was further escalation paratroopers also started landing in the vicinity skirmishes between the paratroopers and the defenders continued until the sun came up but by that point it became clear that the paratroopers had not come alone a wall of ships was slowly coming into view on the horizon and a naval bombardment commenced paul goats the same soldier we referred to earlier said this of the scene as soon as we walked over the dunes and saw thousands of ships and also slanding boats and barrage balloons i knew the wall was lost who could blame him for his hope vanishing all around him buildings crumbled and domesticated animals ran freely but whether they clung to hope or not the defenders were still prepared to put up a fight despite the chaos unleashed around them with minimal air support they knew it was up to them to try to stop the allied advance at least a few soldiers must have been glad to finally face action liberated of that feeling of not knowing when the inevitable would come joseph b a staff sergeant wrote this finally the hour has come although it had to happen and was foreseeable it impressed me a lot of course it is not a trifle for sure these hours the greatest battle is taking place that the world has ever seen hopefully fortune is with us now many of the soldiers away from their positions tried to regroup amid the maelstrom those that did make it converged in fortified bunkers equipped with mounted machine guns and anti-aircraft flat guns however they could only fire upon the invaders in vain as waves and waves of troops landed on the beaches when u.s soldiers inevitably closed in on the bunkers incendiary weapons like flamethrowers and white phosphorus were used with great effect arms experts at globalsecurity.org write these weapons are particularly nasty because white phosphorus continues to burn until it disappears if service members are hit by pieces of white phosphorus it could burn right down to the bone just on normandy five american medal of honors were given in part to the usage of white phosphorus grenades by the end of the morning on june 6 most of the resistance points in all of the beaches had fallen to the allies allowing their armored divisions to support the infantry's inland advance much like at utah beach german forces at sword beach had to contend with paratroopers who had dropped behind their lines and captured critical points helmet rumor a german soldier captured after hiding for 36 hours wrote we were exhausted we decided to hand ourselves over to the british at gold beach the defenders were severely weakened by an aerial bombardment and therefore were defeated within an hour at juno beach the canadian troops managed to not only secure their objective but they also marched further inland than any other landing party finally at omaha german resistance was the most effective because of how close the bunkers were placed to the shore but with so many troops landing the german defenders at omaha were also overrun if you'd like to learn more about the events that brought hitler's ruin with some of my favorite books on the topic we have an exciting announcement for you

or when exactly the allies would strike furthermore the extent of the allies numerical and material advantages were not known to the nazis when hitler awoke a few short hours after the invasion had begun he was pleased to hear the news the air of uncertainty had been cleared and now he thought the allies would be driven back into the sea if you guys haven't already be sure to subscribe and click

historian today's video the Battle of Jana before this video starts I'd like to give a quick shout out to history time I highly recommend watching his video on the predecessors of the Ottoman Empire the seljuq turks the link to that video can be found in the description below it is September 11th 1683 and the city of Vienna is on the verge of collapse a massive Ottoman force has surrounded the city and Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa Pasha is poised to succeed where Suleiman the Magnificent failed more than a century and a half ago the Habsburg Emperor Leopold the first has already fled the city and the relief force comprised of bickering elements of the so-called holy League arrives slowly and piecemeal inside the city members of the tiny garrison search desperately for a bomb that could easily spell doom for their defensive efforts the situation is looking desperate and Ottoman victory is a distinct possibility that is unless reinforcements arrive but before all that only about a year and a half earlier the Ottomans and the Holy Roman Empire were at peace at least nominally the internet and warfare between the two powers had come to a lull though nobody expected it to last the Ottomans had a special hatred for the Hapsburgs whom they considered according to Andrew we Croft despicable usurpers falsely using an imperial title that rightfully belonged to the Ottomans the inheritors by conquest of Rome's Imperial past moreover there was a possibility for the Turks to address old grievances and to fulfill long-standing territorial ambitions just over a century and a half earlier Suleiman the Magnificent had been defeated by the Hapsburgs at Vienna and the Ottomans would not rest until this humiliating loss was avenged this and the opportunistic Ottoman commander Kara Mustafa Pasha initiated a protracted infrastructure campaign building the roads and bridges that would allow supply lines to function as smoothly so that an invasion of Austria could be swift and decisive this is something the Ottomans neglected to do in 1529 in their first invasion but why was this time the most opportune moment to strike against the hapsburgs well we can identify three main reasons number one the Austrians economic woes in the wake of the 30 Years War a conflict which wrought not just Austria but most of Europe to the core number two the intensification of Ostrow Ottoman border conflicts in Hungary and number three a zealous Grand Vizier with fantastical aspirations as soon as it became evident that the Ottomans were planning full-scale invasion Emperor Leopold the first and most of his subjects fled Vienna to gather a relief force should the city be subjected to a siege as the Austrians were in no way prepared to face an ottoman onslaught but experience had taught the remaining defenders well and under the inspiring and stalwart Austrian commander count Ernst rüdiger von Sternberg they promptly got to work Manning Vienna's already impressive defenses the city was a massive nearly impregnable fortress shielded by walls almost 200 feet high and equipped with powerful artillery that outclassed the comparatively small field guns that the Ottomans would end up bringing to the fight however it cannot be overstated how methodical the Turkish siege plans were when Kara Mustafa arrived with a force of nearly 150,000 men in the midsummer of 1683 he ordered the raising of any structure immediately outside the city walls and the construction of an extensive network of trenches to shield his men from defensive fire the Viennese defenders were trapped in the city though again the massive Viennese walls prevented the Ottomans from making a Greek but the Grand Vizier had a plan she would direct a detachment of his forces to plant large explosive mines beneath strategic points in the walls although this process had been used successfully by the Turks in Crete it was expensive and time-consuming and the clock was now ticking Emperor Leopold was quickly rallying support from other Christian powers selling the struggle against the Ottomans as a sort of continuation of the Crusades with support from Pope Innocent xi he and his commander of choice Charles of Lorraine formed an alliance with Poland Lithuania Venice and a number of German principalities that would eventually be called the holy League assembling an alliance that large and diverse is no simple matter which is why the holy leagues force of approximately 90,000 men arrived late to the party the German and imperial forces would end up arriving before the heavy polish cavalry who despite their mobility experienced difficulty moving through the densely forested terrain delays like this were highly problematic by September 11th Kara Mustafa had already destroyed and stormed one of the two major defensive points on the wall and the situation for the Austrians was becoming more dire by the minute early the next morning the holy League forces began deploying a top of a large hill outside the city called the column berg with the Imperials on the left the Germans in the middle and a hole in the right flank where the Polish were supposed to be this didn't stop the battle from kicking off early contact was made around four o'clock in the morning and most of the Turkish army was redirected to fight off their relief force the Imperial and German forces were able to form defensive lines with dense musket ranks to repel repeated cavalry charges by the ottomans below using the high ground to their advantage the most elite well-trained portion of the besieging army the 18,000 strong Janissary force was kept in the rear to storm the city when the and defensive point fell in retrospect Karen Mustafa's failure to commit all of the Janissaries to combat the holy league on the column Berg before Polish forces had fully arrived may well have been his fatal mistake at noon the Polish cavalry finally appeared and Kara Mustafa began to realize that something had gone terribly wrong the bomb he had planted in the walls the previous day hadn't exploded like something out of an old black-and-white cartoon it turned out that a contingent of the Viennese garrison had found the device with its fuse still led and then frantically extinguished the flame however the day had not been won for the holy League just yet still possessing a numerical advantage the Ottomans assessed the situation and decided to fight the relief army head-on the members of the holy League recognized almost immediately that the enemy Force had begun to regroup for an all-out attack and so called for a general charge themselves while Ottoman forces were not yet organized Qingyuan the third sobieski had been waiting for this moment of all of Western Europe's military leaders he had the most experience fighting the Ottomans he had suffered a number of terrible defeats at their hands and one just as many great victories and among them this would be his greatest that one he would forever be remembered for at six o'clock p.m. yon rallied the three thousand polish winged hussars along with the holy leagues fifteen thousand other mounted troops minutes later eighteen thousand men came crashing down the column smashing the Ottoman line the noise was deafening dirt rolling behind these surging troops like a storm on the ground it was the single largest cavalry charge in human history and Kara Mustafa Pasha's forces crumbled before it so BS Keys charge was the most decisive moment of the battle which resulted in the siege being lifted within a few short hours the Turkish war effort did not recover and the holy League would go on to recapture much of Hungary the battle marked the end of the Ottoman incursions into Western Europe and the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's slow decline which finally culminated in its disillusion some two and a half centuries later now a word from our sponsor - Lane if Kara Mustafa Pasha had - Lane he

out to Bing coughs battlegrounds if you're a fan of modern military history we highly recommend you check out this channel we're excited to announce that this video marks the start of our new mini-series on the North African campaign this often disregarded theater of war was of huge importance encompassing the struggle for vital oil fields critical trade routes and the port cities that the Allies would eventually use to liberate Italy first a little background when benito mussolini rose to power in 1922 he began to pursue one of his primary albeit not so realistic goals the resurrection of the roman empire mussolini recognized that this would be a long and arduous process as both Italy's industrial capacity and military were in no position to compete with the European superpowers of Great Britain and France the British in particular represented a significant obstacle in that they controlled both the Suez Canal and Gibraltar the only waterways connecting the Mediterranean to the Indian and Atlantic oceans this provided Britain with the single most efficient means of transporting goods from South Asia to Europe if their British lost the Suez Canal naturally they would suffer a huge blow to trade and colonial management when Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles the Italians felt confident enough to invade Ethiopia in 1935 which put them even closer to the strategic waterway in Egypt the Italians could not openly declare war on Britain just yet but in 1940 they saw their moment after German troops entered France Mussolini promptly redirected forces in West Libya to mass on the Egyptian border before we get into the details of the ensuing military campaign we should spend a minute talking about the tactical aspects that made this campaign so fascinating before it commenced the desert war in northern Africa was sometimes referred to as a tactician stream there were a lot of lofty ideas about how the flat and mostly featureless terrain would provide a sort of real-world chessboard where military theory about mechanized warfare could be put to the test some military planners even believed that the open country would allow tanks to glide around like warships on the open ocean that is the plot of a fantasy novel not the reality of combat in world war ii food water and gasoline had to be hauled over large distances in enormous quantities to even begin to meet the combatants needs historian patty griffith sums it up well writing north africa was such an unforgiving environment in these and many other ways that every mile traveled required a mechanical effort equivalent to well over 2 miles traveled in northwest europe and of course in north africa there were many more miles to be traveled now let's get back to the front line expecting a quick German victory against the Allies Benito Mussolini wanted quote a few thousand dead to gain a seat at the negotiating table therefore his instructions to marshal Rodolfo Graziani governor-general of the colony in Libya and commander of the Italian 10th army were as brief as they were unhelpful attack the British in front of you brows eonni who had earned the nickname of the butcher of the desert [Music] hesitated to go through with Mussolini's very elaborate plans in early September of 1940 he was short on equipment and British hit-and-run tactics cost him nearly 3500 men while the Royal Navy harassed his supply ports at Benghazi and too broke by mid-september Graziani was forced by Mussolini to make his move and actually managed to penetrate 100 kilometres into British territory portions of the Italian 10th army totaling 80 thousand of his 250,000 men got as far as the city of sidi behrani in northwest egypt which they captured on September 16th unfortunately for the bumbling butcher that was when all of those logistical issues that I mentioned earlier really caught up with him Roz eonni ended up spending more than two months waiting for resupply a period that the Allies mockingly referred to as his sits Krieg and while Graziani was trying to get organized his enemies were successfully doing just that Sir Archibald Wavell who commanded the British Army in the Middle East had thus far been bluffing quite successfully Italian forces in the north consisted of around 250,000 men and in the south 350,000 Wavell had just 86,000 under his command it was only through a number of elaborate ruses including inflatable dummy tanks and false tracks that he was able to hold the Italians at bay with more material and manpower freed up by the victory at the Battle of Britain Wavell decided it was time to stop using balloon tanks and start using real tanks under the command of Major General Richard O'Connor plans were made for an offensive codenamed Operation compass just before dusk on December 7th the British 7th armored and the fourth Indian divisions set out for the Italian front line for days the advance continued undetected by Italian forces on the 9th II British Western force ambushed the Italian garrison at Nabila taking approximately 2,000 prisoners despite Graziano's overwhelming numerical Vantage O'Connor consistently brought more tanks to any given engagement by massing his forces together against Graziani 'he's spread out defensive perimeter within days Graziano's frontline was broken and he quickly ordered a retreat back to Bardia in libya just three days after the start of Operation compass Italian forces were completely withdrawn from Egypt and O'Conner pushed on despite their victory the British military suffered significant setbacks during the pursue the 7th Armored Division suffered a critical loss of vehicles and the fourth Indian Division was sent to garrison Sudan being replaced by the more inexperienced sixth Australian division nonetheless O'Connor was able to capitalize on captured Italian vehicles and fuel to move forward when he arrived at Bardia on December 27th he found it well-prepared protected by mines barbed wire machine-gun nests and anti-tank ditches constructed along a 30 kilometre defensive line with his fresh Australian troops taking point he launched his assault the attack was heavily supplemented by air attacks by the RAF and bombardment by the Royal Navy's Mediterranean fleet On January 5th the town was occupied by the British and two-thirds of the Italian 10th army had been killed or captured promptly after this victory the 7th Armored Division cut off 2 Broke and the Australians came to lay siege by late January the Italian garrison of 25,000 surrendered the remainder of Graziano's 10th army retreated as fast as it could with the British in hot pursuit running almost entirely off of captured gasoline when the Italians were close to escaping the grasp of the 7th Armored Division a detachment of mechanized vehicles was sent out to race ahead of the Italian 10th army at bethe fom Italian forces heading from Benghazi were ambushed and stalled by this which bought enough time for the rest of the British tanks to arrive in Stephen W Sears book desert war in North Africa he writes this in two months O'Conner had advanced 500 miles with a force never larger than 30,000 men he had taken 130,000 prisoners 380 tanks and almost 850 pieces of field artillery his total casualties came to just over 1900 after the defeat of the Italian Army the British government confident that there would be no counter-attack anytime soon relocated most of the British troops stationed in North Africa in an attempt to hold off an axis invasion in Greece but all this time across the sea Adolf Hitler had been keeping a wary eye on the repeated defeats of his allies with about as much faith in Mussolini's strategic mind as was probably warranted he dispatched one of

german and austro-hungarian empires collapsed all at once the russian civil war which had started in 1917 was in full swing by 1919 and the communist red army in russia had largely rounded the anti-bolshevik white army fearing the revolution would continue spilling into neighboring states poland sent forces to the russo-polish border though no one really knows how exactly the polish soviet war started most believe it was a gradual escalation eventually leading to a large-scale polish offensive after several skirmishes with communist partisans by the end of 1919 the poles had pushed as far as vilnius and minsk in the north and had taken a large suave of western ukraine all with very little resistance as the russians were simply not prepared to defend themselves against a polish incursion in the midst of civil war the polls under leadership of yusuf politsky quickly formed an alliance with what was left of ukraine and launched yet another offensive in april of 1920. they again encountered very little resistance and even took the ukrainian capital of kiev in early may but then they stopped polish forces had no capacity to move further the polish and ukrainian forces had to walk hundreds of miles with almost no vehicles and barely enough horses to carry supplies the new occupiers of kiev were exhausted barely equipped and hundreds of miles away from reinforcements the poles in the northeastern end of the border were not much better off they too had stretch supply lines with only 120 000 men and 460 artillery pieces spread along an open and indefensible frontier they were extremely vulnerable by now moscow had had enough after months of a slow buildup the red army had about 300 000 men with an ample supply of artillery that were ready for deployment red army commander and eventual ice pick repository leon trotsky ordered a two-prong attack he sent joseph stalin to the south to retake kiev and then move further west into ukrainian territory meanwhile tukuchevsky was to attack from the north and retake belarus total numbers are hard to come by but soviet forces in these two attacks numbered around three hundred thousand and were split evenly between stalin and tukachevsky tukichewski's army of 160 000 men pushed west in early july 1920. he brought along more than 700 artillery pieces and almost 3 000 machine guns far outgunning any polish defenders meanwhile in the south most of the fighting was done by the first cavalry army comprised exclusively of men crazy enough to still fight on horseback even after world war one they swung around kiev and captured the city of brody far behind the polish in the first week of august they then planned to move quickly to levive stalin's infantry was slower but they made great advances as well but how did the russians turn the tide so quickly well the initial russian attack was successful due to a combination of three major factors first was superior numbers second was the fact that the polish were at the end of their supply lines and third was the disorganized state of the polish army having received most of its equipment from other countries while the russians weren't extremely well organized either they were at least able to supply most of their troops sufficiently at least for now while the original russian plan was to just take back the ukraine and territory that poland had occupied tukichewski pushed on the energetic and opportunistic general believed that the proletariat would rise up wherever russian troops arrived he planned to destroy the polish army in the north take warsaw and then spread the communist revolution into germany the political leaders of moscow were a little more cautious fearing retaliation from non-communist european powers on the other hand they were also afraid of confronting tukachevsky lest he turn on them chugachewski was relentless and kept up a murderous speed never allowing the polish army to rest regroup or organize a defense but poor logistical consideration took a toll on tukachevsky's force large numbers of casualties were sustained and many soldiers who couldn't keep up with the advance were simply left behind the soldiers who did keep up had to defend a long and outstretched perimeter while still pushing west by the time the attack commenced on warsaw tukachevsky only had 50 000 men ready for the assault of his original 160 thousand what's worse stalin after receiving contradictory orders refused to send the first cavalry army to warsaw keeping them stationed in leve more troops were siphoned off when tukuchevsky was ordered to send reinforcements to crimea as stalin was hung up in levive and the entire fourth army was cut out of the picture as they were fully committed to the westward push in northern poland after their communication line was broken with headquarters this left the area around warsaw extremely vulnerable and huge gaps in the line appeared meanwhile yusuf polutsky had managed to gather all available troops in warsaw for a last-ditch defense fighting was fierce and the polish forces stationed across the vestula river were gradually pushed back but polutsky noticed a major gap in soviet lines just south of the city that allowed him to break through and flank the 16th army isolating the 15th army it was a resounding success after 10 days of fighting polish forces had inflicted around 60 thousand casualties and captured approximately 60 thousand more by contrast poland only suffered around 30 000 casualties by the time of tukichewski's retreat he had at most seven divisions left that could fight but no worries the first cavalry army was finally on the move to help tukochewski take warsaw yeah they were a little out of the loop by late august the cavalry was completely surrounded and realized they were invading poland all by themselves what followed was yet another russian defeat at the battle of kamarov europe's last major cavalry battle just a month later in late september politsky launched a new offensive relentlessly driving the russians back ultimately bringing the soviets to the negotiating table the piece of riga was signed on march 18th of the following year granting poland parts of lithuania belarus and ukraine poland would hold on to this territory until 1939 when they were defeated by germany and the soviet union that invasion is more well known for a number of reasons but we shouldn't let it eclipse the importance of the events we've talked about today in the early days of communist rule in the ussr it was genuinely unclear how far the new movement might spread especially in europe's chaotic interwar political climate if the polish had not stopped the soviet's western advances the course of european history in the 20th

       " \" Hi, I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian today's episode how America's mission in Vietnam failed This video is sponsored by war thunder more on that later Good morning Vietnam and everywhere else The Vietnam conflict is one of the most controversial chapters in US history and helped define an entire generation Its enduring notoriety can be traced to a number of factors these included unprecedented media coverage and widespread distrust of the American government to Help understand this watershed moment were asking the question of how a global superpower suffered such a humiliating defeat Before we talk about America's defeat in Vietnam We'll have to talk about Vietnam under French rule which started in the latter half of the 19th century Since Europeans are just so great at listening to native people and respecting their pre-existing geographic borders They decided to call this region which includes modern-day Laos Cambodia and Vietnam Indochina presumably because it's sandwiched between India and China it was all very subtle and creative France quickly and decisively established themselves in this region quelling any uprisings and forcing local rulers to cooperate with French colonial administrators but this changed during the Second World War in 1940 France was occupied by Germany leaving their colonial territory largely undefended and Japan was quick to seize this opportunity Some initially saw the Japanese as Asian liberators But were quickly disillusioned by the sheer brutality of the new regime and nationalist sentiments began to sweep the nation calling for self-governance once the Allies had secured victory in 1945 the French returned to Indochina and everyone was just so happy to see them especially the Vietnam Independence League were Viet men this group of armed insurgents was led by the once exiled Intellectual Ho Chi Minh, who is staunchly? anti-colonialist at This point the United States was in a bind as they once supported the Viet Minh against the Japanese during the Second World War but French stability was seen as an important element in stopping communism from spreading into Southeast Asia and men's Anti-colonialist stance was something decidedly Bolshevik in influence. Despite French calls for support during the 1940s and 50s the United States ultimately decided not to send troops to Vietnam by 1954 friends had completely pulled out of Indochina after seven long years of bloodshed splitting the area between Communists aligned North Vietnam and an Unpopular and generally corrupt Western aligned South Vietnam, but peace wouldn't last long in 1955 fighting continued but this time between north and south President Kennedy, like Eisenhower was hesitant to put boots on the ground in Vietnam after the humiliating defeat of France But after Kennedy's assassination in 1963 vice president, lyndon, b johnson seeing communism threatened the status quo in asia once more ramped up US involvement after the late summer of 1964 when it was claimed that two US ships that were aiding the South Vietnamese military Came under attack by communist forces in the Gulf of Tonkin Congress soon gave President Johnson the authority to send US troops and by early 1965 thousands were deployed now that we know why exactly America found itself in Vietnam, let's find out how it all went wrong The American soldiers in Vietnam were fighting two enemies whose battle tactics were well honed through years of combat against the French and Japanese the first were southern Insurgents called the Vietcong and the second were the more organized North Vietnamese Army were NVA The NVA was well supplied by the Soviet Union and China and fought with aggressive guerrilla tactics that the US was in most ways for Us general william Westmoreland led the American army in Vietnam and waged a strictly attrition based defensive war Westmoreland was known to have let politics dictate his decision-making process as policymakers in Washington Instead wanted statistics and numbers to show that they were winning Success was measured by body counts but counter-intuitively the more bombs that were dropped and the more people that were killed the more support the North Vietnamese gained The US was attempting to wage a conventional war as they did in Korea But the non-uniformed Vietcong were highly mobile and unidentifiable avoiding direct Confrontations whenever they could relying on ambushes booby traps and similar tactics to grind at US morale The result of this strategy was that there were no actual front lines while the Vietcong frustrated US troops in the south the NVA commander roll wings off also knew that a conventional war was Impossible to win and focused on winning over the people through an extensive propaganda network He is quoted saying do not fear the enemy for they can only take your life Fear the media far more for they will destroy your honor the Americans meanwhile believed that their attrition strategy Was successful and Westmoreland was predicting an imminent end of world But unbeknownst to him Vietnamese forces were effectively using the Ho Chi Minh Trail to move large amounts of supplies through neutral Laos Despite being bombed almost every hour By 1968 the US illusion of imminent victory was shattered by the Tet Offensive the Google campaign saw over 80,000 NBA and Vietcong troops attacked more than 800 cities throughout the country Including the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon much of the fighting such as in Wei became the war's bloodiest battles Despite launching such an ambitious attack the NVA made few if any tangible gains But it struck a devastating blow to American morale not only back in the United States But also in the field at home the leaking of the Pentagon Papers Also dispelled any justifications for the war and revealed atrocities such as the My Lai massacre Further increasing an anti-war sentiment across the country and a so-called credibility gap began to grow between what the public was told and what they believed as William, Westmoreland himself would later say it's the first war we've ever fought on the television screen and the first war that our country ever fought where the media had full rein the casualties suffered in the war were now seen in a new light with so many men having been lost thus far on the other side of the world and they Weren't even winning while the NVA could strike at any time faced with a crushing li- public opinion The American government was forced to withdraw the nation's forces in 1973 and two years later the NVA finally

       " \" hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian today's video why was the French military so preoccupied with eating baguettes instead of fighting the Second World War this video is sponsored by Skillshare more on that later the Swift capitulation of France in 1940 is often attributed to a surprise attack through the Benelux and left at that but fewer people take a moment to consider why the French were so vulnerable to a surprise attack in the first place today we'll be discussing three major reasons for Frances defeat in 1940 economic woes increasing civilian control over the military and a conservative military philosophy will also evaluate German and French military equipment to decide whether the factor played a significant role in deciding the outcome of the clash between the two powers let's begin by evaluating the state of the French army from 1918 up until 1936 a period characterized by a gradual decline in French military prowess immediately after the first world war France experienced a brain drain with many rich educated and experienced officers resigning this is not surprising since such things happen after every war but the French seem to believe that a lasting peace was finally reached with many genuinely trusting that the League of Nations could prevent future wars massive military budget cuts ensued and service training was gradually reduced from three years to just one year these budget cuts were largely the result of a dire economic situation after the first world war France was nearly bankrupt and as a result of the Great Depression in the 1930s it never really had the chance to recover just as the situation in France reached an all-time low Germany was beginning to experience an upswing Paul Marie de Lycoris writes that by 1936 the economic and financial situation of France had never been worse these economic woes compounded with Germany's resurgence as a major power directly translated Frances sphere of influence diminishing as well Czechoslovakia Romania and Yugoslavia once allies and trade partners now looked elsewhere to make matters worse the problems of the French military apparatus were exacerbated by the civilian sectors increasingly tight hold on the army and bureaucracy this was the result of a political chasm between the extreme left-wing Popular Front and the centre-right coalition with both sides trying to secure as many military positions as possible to forestall the possibility of one using the military against the other in short loyalty was prized over competence so it was the bureaucrats who got all the promotion's as a result of having a non-military bureaucracy run by civilians with minimal military experience and an absence of experienced generals the French military philosophy was fundamentally flawed in the 1930s the French constructed the Maginot Line on the franco-german border as part of its defensive strategy but fo miksa put it best stating that the Maginot Line was a formidable barrier not so much against the German army as against French understanding of modern war the line was hailed as impenetrable but it was impenetrable in the same way that the Titanic was unsinkable it had weak spots and in 1940 Hitler's forces were able to breach the line through the Ardennes Forest since the French were of the mistaken conviction that the rough terrain would deter any German tank attacks again the problem lies with military philosophy standard military strategy states that in order to win you need a superior force the French interpreted this statement to mean that they needed superior strength across the whole front line the Germans on the other hand focused on bolstering their strength at one or two carefully selected points and then launching an aggressive attack using fast light vehicles dive bombers and fighters all in unison now that we've compared French and German military philosophies let's compare military equipment to come to a conclusion about the extent to which it decided a German victory one can make the assertion that friend infantry was in some ways superior to German infantry not only did the French have superior numbers and supply lines but contrary to prevailing thought it was more motorized and outfitted with modern equipment than the Vermont theoretically French armor should have also enjoyed an advantage over its German counterpart the French char b1 this heavy tank was virtually impenetrable from the front and the Sohma s35 medium tank also had more durable armor than that of the German Panzers however one could argue that Germany used its tanks more effectively Germany's tank battalions were composed of independent lightly armored tank divisions and as previously discussed their speed was harnessed to surprise the French the Germans also employed wireless technology each tank being equipped with radio receivers to relay and mobilise battalions at a pace that Lee French who used flags instead of radios simply couldn't match and asked for the air forces of both countries the French are made illa air was at a disadvantage numerically despite high levels of French aircraft production this is because the French had very few spare parts for their aircraft and consequently could neither prepare or repair their planes for service as fast as the Germans still French fighters generally outperformed their German foes with two German fighters being down for every one French fighter overall we can see that France held a slight advantage when it came to their military equipment but a poor military philosophy completely negated this advantage it should not come as a surprise that this faulty military philosophy was upheld when one remembers the brain-drain we discussed previously at a fundamental level what the French lacked was imagination innovation and a willingness to learn from the first world war the French were rudely awakened from a dream of peace that lasted just a bit too long having fallen asleep under the false sense of security provided to them by the League of Nations now on to today's sponsor Skillshare Skillshare is the ultimate online

       " \" hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian today's video what was life like for the average citizen living in Imperial Japan this video is sponsored by Skillshare more on that later for our story we will follow the journey of two average citizens living under the rule of the Japanese Empire one of these citizens is ethnically Japanese and the other is Han Chinese born in the Imperial territory of Taiwan this will allow us to experience two different perspectives of life in Imperial Japan if you guys like this format we can replicate it for future videos in this series before delving into everyday life we should first explore the origins of militarism and authoritarianism that would come to define it a good place to start is 1868 when the old feudal system known as the Shogun was replaced with a strong centralized government which sought to achieve direct control over its population this came to be known as the meiji restoration a critical moment in japan's history as the new imperial government embraced Western technology and bureaucracy which stood in stark contrast to the isolationist Shogunate that had existed for centuries prior with a new internationalist foreign policy came in active hand in global affairs which resulted in several Wars and expeditions significantly expanding the reach of the Japanese state as the economy shifted and the war machine needed to be fueled there were massive repercussions for the common imperial subject [Music] the year is 1923 and for our Japanese individual Isamu life could have begun in a rural area outside of Tokyo his family had been farmers for hundreds of years but in the generations since the Meiji Restoration they have since transitioned to textile manufacturing even opening up their own workshop this is something that you saw Mo's family takes particular pride in and indeed so does the whole of the Empire for modernization happened so rapidly that agriculture now accounts for less than 20% of the national GDP in pre Meiji Japan almost the entire society was agrarian based meanwhile life for our Taiwanese subject soohyun is a different matter unlike Isamu soohyun and her family still work in agriculture not for themselves however but to sustain the working population of Japan's home islands and while soohyun's family lives under Japan and faces a degree of discrimination they have shown rapid adaptation to the Japanese regime forceful assimilation has been something the Imperial Government has implemented in recent years their strategy changing Taiwanese Chinese names to Japanese promoting the Japanese language and finally drafting the Taiwanese population into the Imperial Army by 1930 Isamu is 12 and is just starting his secondary education the Japanese schooling system at this time is structured so that it teaches the traditional honor code of Bushido which included strict loyalty to the state su yen now also twelve has already finished school her education was different than ISA moves but with because of her ethnicity and her gender because su yen was Taiwanese her education was focused on breaking down her Han Chinese ethnic identity and reconstructing her as a loyal Japanese subject for that reason only primary education was mandatory focused heavily on literacy but also on familiarity with Japanese culture and customs universal education especially of girls was something relatively limited in Japan and its territories legal equality would not be fully realized until 1945 in Japan under a new post-war constitution and in Taiwan in 1946 under the Republican Chinese government one important aspect of Japanese culture is faith namely Shintoism and by this time state Shintoism the japanese government has taken massive steps since the Meiji Restoration to not only oversee religion in its empire but conflate it with ultra-nationalism Assam whose family is traditional and they take their faith seriously because of the newly implemented state Shintoism they now look down on foreign religions such as Taoism and Christianity not only that but they view their Emperor Hirohito as a deity descending from the Japanese Sun God Amaterasu because Asano and much of the Japanese population except Hirohito to be a direct successor of the Sun God they believe this gives him a divine right to rule over both Japan and the world in Taiwan suyun practises taiwanese buddhism which is one of the few tolerated religions in imperial japan in fact japanese buddhists work with those in taiwan frequently but because of how different Japanese Buddhism is from Taiwanese Buddhism there hasn't been much cooperation as for future hopes and aspirations Isamu is looking forward to graduating high school unlike what happened in previous generations he won't be able to freely choose his wife instead his father will find a wife for him shortly after he becomes an adult a tradition known as bi or omiai she'll have to be of pure Japanese blood as his father would never choose a half Korean or someone of the lower classes in the meantime Asano is on track to taking on more responsibilities in the home-based factory he plans on eventually taking over once his father decides to retire su yen on the other hand now goes into a period of unofficial training to become a wife and a mother once she is old enough she will be given to a husband and expected to take care of the household her main concern is not of she'll like her husband but whether or not she'll be able to bear children if she fails to do so she may have to return to her parents home and live there but as war approaches our characters may not go down the path they plan for by the time they're 18 years old in 1936 both Isamu and suyun find themselves drawn increasingly to supporting the imperial armed forces both will have different ways to support the troops both will have different reasons for doing so and both will have very different experiences in the field but that's a tale for another time now on to today's sponsor Skillshare scale share is the ultimate online self-improvement tool offering users thousands of classes in all

       " ' Before we start, I want to thank NordVPN for sponsoring this video. Hi, I\\'m Griffin Johnson, the Armchair Historian. Today\\'s video: the War of the Spanish Succession. Coming up: pretender claimants, complex geopolitics, and some really funny looking Hapsburg jaws. Europe\\'s long and complex history is marked by many wars sparked by territorial, religious, and colonial disputes to name a few. But it was fear of having one country or one dynasty directly governing too much of Europe that lay at the heart of the War of the Spanish Succession. Before we start, I would like to give a shout out to my friend and patreon supporter Derek. He\\'s headed to basic training on the 22nd. So I\\'d like everyone to wish him good luck. Now on to the video. In the year 1665, the Spanish throne passed to the sickly Charles II; a man who made even Frankenstein look attractive. His health problems prompted contemporaries to refer to him as \\'El Hechizado,\\' or \\'The Bewitched.\\' It is traditionally held that Charles II\\'s severe mental and physical impairments were a consequence of inbreeding; something that the Hapsburg Royals did frequently to ensure that wealth and influence remained in the family. Although the Hapsburgs weren\\'t the only ones to partake in such a practice, They are the only royal family to have an inbreeding induced deformity named after them the: Hapsburg Jaw. One of the Hapsburgs\\' infamous disabilities was infertility; and consequently, when the Spanish king, Charles II, died at the age of 38, he still lacked an heir. A coalition of European powers had long been devising plans to divide the Spanish Empire\\'s vast holdings across the continent; and the time had come to put those plans into action. However, there was one obstacle that the coalition had to surmount: Charles II had stated in his will that his kingdom should be left to Philip of Anjou, the grandson of the famed French monarch Louis XIV, also known as the Sun King. Louis followed Charles\\' will and recognized Philip as the new King of Spain. \"Not so fast!\" was the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I\\'s first reply The Emperor refused to recognize Philip of Anjou and instead laid claim to the Spanish throne on behalf of his son, Archduke Karl VI. \"Noble Spaniards, I hereby proclaim that my son, Archduke Karl VI of Austria will be your rightful sovereign and ruler of the Spanish Empire. He shall henceforth be called \\'Carlos.\\'\" \"¿Qué? (What?)\" The Spanish people were not fans of this new Austrian pretender and a momentous clash was brewing. On one side stood France and Spain, aided by Portugal, Hungary, Savoy, and a handful of German principalities; and on the other, stood the Grand Alliance comprised of England, Scotland, the Dutch Republic, Austria, Prussia, and Hanover. It wasn\\'t long before the two alliances prepared for war. From the onset of the war of the Spanish Succession, coalition forces were on the offensive. In 1703, a decisive naval victory at Vigo Bay was one, which prompted Portugal to flip sides that same year opening a new front in Iberia. around the same time Savoy also flipped sides, further pressuring French and Spanish Holdings in Italy. Between 1704 and 1708, this trend of aggression continued, as the Alliance won victory after victory in Central Europe. The military prowess of John Churchill, whose victory at Blenheim, forced Bavaria out of the war, and Prince Eugene of Savoy allowed coalition forces to fully contain France. These victories even included two brief occupations of Madrid and successful occupations of Barcelona and Valencia. But Philip of Anjou remained firmly seated on the throne, in part as a result of his popularity with the Spanish people. \"¿Qué?\" But massive war expenditures gradually took a toll on the Spanish and French treasuries. By 1708, both sides were in a deadlock. The French were completely forced out of northern Italy; and Spain, out of southern Italy. the British Royal Navy also enjoyed naval supremacy in the Mediterranean, even seizing Spanish Gibraltar and Menorca. But France itself remained relatively untouched and no lasting breakthroughs were made in Spain. Most of the participating countries wanted the war to come to a close, but France wouldn\\'t budge. Louis\\' decision to continue fighting paid off. Why? Because in 1705, the Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I, died, passing the throne to his eldest son, Joseph, who then also died in 1711. This meant that Archduke Karl VI was now Holy Roman Emperor, the man the Grand Alliance was fighting to place on the Spanish throne. This, needless to say, complicated things, as no one in Europe wanted to see Karl VI accumulate so much power at the head of both the Holy Roman and the Spanish empires. An important thing to remember is that the grand alliance was attempting to establish a balance of power on the continent, so that no dynasty had too much control. However, with no figurehead to rally behind, the Grand Alliance soon collapsed, allowing the French to negotiate for more favorable terms, but they still needed to make concessions. Philip of Anjou remained on the Spanish throne, but several measures were taken to limit French power, including the transfer of territories and trade privileges to the Allies (Grand Alliance). Among the territories were parts of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Hudson Bay, St. Kitts Gibraltar, and Menorca, all ceded to the British. The war empowered the British in other ways as well. By the time it ended, Britain had the largest navy in the world. Additionally, the war significantly weakened the Dutch, who had been one of, if not, the greatest obstacle to British mercantile supremacy. Austria, meanwhile, did gain parts of the Netherlands, and was able to secure its hold over Italy and Hungary. During that same century British and Austrian preeminence in Europe would be challenged in the War of the Austrian Succession, just a couple decades later. Meanwhile, the losses suffered by the severely overextended French state marked the beginning of the end of French hegemony in Central Europe for nearly a century. But they would return to the region as a transformed state not under a king, but an emperor. Now on to our sponsor, NordVPN. Many people neglect their online privacy.

online accounts and passwords secure with dashlane comm forward slash armchair historian and get 10% off of your first year of dashlane premium today we're going to be traveling from antiquity to present day and learning about the myriad reasons soldiers throughout history wore flashy uniforms we'll begin by addressing the Pitts a tribal Confederation indigenous to Scotland although the pics did not wear a uniform they are relevant to our discussion because of their use of face and body paint one popular theory is that the name pict was imposed on these tribesmen by the Romans who allegedly used the Latin word pic T meaning painted or tattooed people to describe them Polybius the Greek historian wrote of another tribal group the Gallic gasset a some of whom went to war naked just like the pics across the channel it is likely that the primary reason both groups adopted this practice was because of its effectiveness as an intimidation tactic commanders had a similar rationale far into the future they wanted to intimidate their foes just without exposing their troops brightly coloured and visible uniforms were part of their strategy to achieve this end we need not leave the British Isles to make an observation about uniform trends during the Middle Ages during the medieval period the armies of England Scotland and pretty much every other European state consisted of feudal levies and mercenaries there were no standing armies in these states in order to clearly be identified on the battlefields oftentimes medieval soldiers were armored with brightly coloured taverns depicting their Lords coat of arms this practice filled into the modern era well past the Middle Ages in the book a history of the regiments and uniforms of the British Army Maj Barnes writes that until the mid 18th century the Colonel's personal coat of arms or crest was emblazoned on the colors and only Grenadier caps of the men but to say that the nature of combat and uniforms had not evolved throughout Europe would be grossly inaccurate between 1645 and 1715 many of them garbed with colorful uniforms innovations in dress regular pay and strict discipline all became the norm for standing armies which forms the core of a state's defense standardized coloration of uniforms and drilling were introduced hand-in-hand as uniformity among the ranks helped contribute to the professionalization of an army during this period beginning in the 17th century and concluding in the 19th century warfare was also characterized by the advent of guns and Tillery along with all of the smoke and confusion that accompanied them a generals ability to locate and direct his troops significantly contributed to the outcome of almost each and every battle bright uniforms along with flags and standards which had been used since antiquity became especially important as they allowed units to be quickly identified and contrary to what you might think these showy uniform colors were relatively affordable for example the British used red uniforms since as early as 1600 primarily because of the cheapness of red dyes by the time of the Napoleonic Wars uniforms became increasingly extravagant but they would fall out of fashion the following century the end of brightly colored uniforms coincided with a change in battlefield tactics the introduction of the machine gun along with more accurate firearms made invisibility more beneficial than visible resonators new methods of communication such as the pigeon post cabled telegram and phone allowed commanders to issue orders without having to locate their troops amid this smoky chaos by the time the Balkan Wars broke out in 1912 uniforms were quickly becoming deep color honest some objected to this shift however claiming that it undermined good taste and national pride perhaps as a result of this logic the French continued to use bright red trousers until the first weeks of the first world war when they realized that good tastes didn't save their men from boys according to Andrew Nitin and his article by 1914 most countries in Europe had changed from their traditional brightly colored uniforms to khakis grays and other neutral colors that would blend in this saved soldiers from being easy targets for guns of growing accuracy and range today camouflage is by and large the most prevalent uniform design except for ceremonial uniforms like the Queen's Guard or the pont official Swiss Guard who are of course not expected to engage in combat on the field coloured uniforms are worn on the battlefield pretty much exclusively by organizations like the you and peacekeepers who iconic lead on light blue helmets with the sole reason of being identified on the battlefield and

Today\\'s video - \"How did Italy Lose Against Ethiopia?\" During the scramble for Africa every indigenous nation that was invaded by European powers felt within a matter of decades, all except one The Ancient empire of Ethiopia also known as Abyssinia as a world watched the supposedly primitive Ethiopians were able to repel a modern European army. This defeat was grave and humiliating and many were puzzled as to how it could have occurred. Before we start analyzing this defeat let\\'s get some background on the cause of invasion In 1869, not long after Italy was unified into one kingdom, the Italians who felt that they were fall behind in this scramble for Africa, purchased a small port on the Red Sea from the local eretrians and began expanding outwards. In approximately 20 years they control a significant portion of East Africa and as this was occurring the nearby Ethiopian empire which have existed in the region for over 600 years suddenly found itself cut-off from the sea and by 1887, skirmishers were occurring between the Italians and local Ethiopian warlords. This culminated in the Battle of the Galley in which an Italian column was ambushed and destroyed by the Ethiopians. After this the Italians were determined to pacify Ethiopia and they saw their chance when its emperor died and the throne was claimed by the Italian supported Menelik II Italy signed a treaty with Menelik that promised backing to his claim as well as financial and military aid in exchange for recognition of Italy\\'s colonial territories. However, there were 2 versions of the treaty One was written in the Italian and the other Amharic, the language of Ethiopia and each have different terms. The contentious clause which eventually would lead to the outbreak of war was in the Italian version of the treaty which stated that Ethiopia was effectively a colonial protectorate of Italy a provision that did not exist in Amharic draft. After Menelik tried to establish diplomatic relations with other European countries, it was only a matter of time before the Italians accused him of breaching the treaty. Although all other European nations refused to recognized Ethiopia\\'s independence Russia was supportive of Menelik\\'s ambitions as they were both Orthodox Christian countries. War finally came in December of 1894 when a group of Ethiopian insurgences under the leadership of a local king attacked an Italian Court in the colony of Victoria. In response to this, the Italian sent expeditions into Ethiopia, an act which served as a declaration of war. The leader of this expedition General Oreste Baratieri had previous military experience in the Wars of Italian Unification and in Eritrea, Baratieri\\'s expedition of 20000 men was composed to both Italian soldiers and local Eritrean auxiliaries who are mostly equipped with the nearly outdated vetterli rifle which used a black powder cartridge Although Baratieri\\'s expedition encountered initial success against some of the local kings, things would change after Menelik assembled a massive army of 200000 men in September of 1895 Though they were armed with spears and swords, about half of them were armed with modern rifles which had been purchased from the Russians. Interestingly, the Ethiopians all things considered were better equipped than their Italian counterparts who were unaware of this due to Menelik scumming He let the Italians to believe that Ethiopia was a completely primitive country on the brink of collapse The Italian government therefore ordered Baratieri to make a drive straight for Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. Although the Italian were successful in their initial movements, the first omen of what would come of their ambitions in Ethiopia came at the Battle of Amba Alagi on December the 7th of 1895. Only a few months into the new year, the Italian campaign abruptly ended when Baratieri finally encountered Menelik\\'s army in the mountain near the town of Adwa General Baratieri\\'s expediton was already beginning to run low on water, amunitions and morale And when the huge Ethiopian army of aproximately 120,000 men was spotted, he was understandably planning to retreat but this was not an option as he was ordered by Italian prime minister Crispi, no I\\'m not making that name up to attack Menelik\\'s force. On the of February 29th, Baratieri divided his expedition into three prongs and began marching into the mountains near Menelik\\'s encampment When sun rose, the three Italian brigades stood miles away from each other due to outdated maps. To make matters worse for Baratieri, his men had been spotted by the enemy and were in no position to create the crossfire situation that they had originally planned. Rather, the left brigade found itself under heavy rifle and artillery fire and the Ethiopians had positioned themselves at higher elevation. The other brigades did not arrive in time to support and the Italian left was annihilated in a series of charges. Similarly, the center brigade which was now dangerously isolated was consumed by mass infantry assaults And when the final Italian brigade attempted to retreat, it was funneled into a narrow ravine and was utterly destroyed by Menelik\\'s cavalry. During all of this, the Ethiopians lost 10% of their men  while the Italians lost nearly 60%. After this decisive defeat, Baratieri retreated back into Eritrea but was not pursued by Menelik, who wanted to preserve his strength. When news of the disaster at Adwa reached Italy, there were mass riots and protests against Crispi\\'s administration. Italy was forced to sue for peace and after some negotiation, the two nations signed the Treaty of Addis Ababa, which demanded little from the Italians except the recognition of Ethiopian independence. In conclusion we can see that the Italians lost due to a combination of factors, the biggest being that they were unprepared for a remote war, especially against a state as well organized and well-equipped as Ethiopia. The Battle of Adwa serves as a perfect microcosm through which to view the First Italo-Ethiopian War. Adwa was a feisty ill-conceived operation undertaken by a force with inadequate planning against numerically superior enemy that was incorrectly perceived, at least by the Italian government. A secondary reason for the Ethiopian victory was Menelik\\'s foresight, as he had been stockpiling modern weaponry for years after Ethiopia had been devastated by a British invasion in 1868. In the long term Ethiopian hegemony would not last, as the rise of fascism and revanchist rhetoric after the First World War made it clear that Italian affairs in East Africa were not over. King Menelik II has gone down in history as one of the most innovative leaders in Africa. His methodical approach to solving strategic and bureaucratic issues allowed him to conduct the war against Italy successfully and develop Ethiopia into a modern state with electricity, infrastructure and financial institutions. It is the same methodical approach that our sponsor Brilliant along with mathematics, science and physics.

Meanwhile in Japan things were looking up after their decisive victory over the Chinese in the sino-japanese war In Richard Bernstein's work. He writes this of the conflict Japan's major goal was the possession of Korea and Manchuria The vast landmass is just across the sea that were stepping stones towards the even larger prize, which was China This defeat prompted cries for reform and after a series of failed revolts including the 1899 Boxer Rebellion the Qing government found itself in an even more precarious position by 1911 the government was fully overthrown in what was called the Wu Chun Revolution the leaders of this revolution selected the exiled Intellectual Sun yat-sen to be China's first president in 1912 However, their territories were limited to southern China Meanwhile, the boy Emperor Puyi remained in power in the north. He was backed by General Yuan Shikai Who had the largest army in the region and therefore pretty much called the shots? Thus soon yot sent one XI Chi over to his side without bloodshed by offering him the presidency From there things didn't exactly go as planned. You want imposed a military dictatorship and egg Sun yat-sen after he formed the opposing Kuomintang or KMT in 1916 yuan proclaimed himself emperor of China pretty much missing the point of the rebellion in Ireland He quickly lost much of his support and after his death China was once again balkanized in two regions under the control of local Warlords after yuan died soon yat-sen returned to China and at the helm of the nationalist Kuomintang party was able to take power and impose yet another military government in 1921 shortly after in 1923 They sealed cooperation with the Communist Party of China or CPC in exchange for assistance in ending regionalism The CPC had been founded in the wake of the may 4th movement which involved a series of student protests formed in opposition to the Chinese government's Ineffective response to the Treaty of Versailles, which transferred what was formerly Chinese own land to the Japanese The may 4th movement popularized Marxism as a radical alternative to the Kuomintang really the only reason the CPC aligned itself with the KMT was so it could spread communism as it liberated each warlord state with the assistance of the much stronger KMT in 1925 soon yat-sen died leaving China in the hands of Chiang kai-shek who two years later initiated what was known as the white terror in response to a communist plot to overthrow him this resulted in the deaths of Thousands of members of the CPC in the aftermath communist leaders lead Lee Sung and Mao Zedong Began waging a guerrilla war against the Kuomintang While this was happening the soviet union who saw the CPC as their communist allies Directed it to take a more aggressive stance Against the Kuomintang as a result Lee Lisan ordered an offensive to be carried out against the Nationalists It was a disaster and led to his replacement by a group of Chinese intellectuals called d28 Bolsheviks with warlords still in control of numerous regions and the two major political factions of China in all-out war the Situation was looking worse than ever Seeing the turmoil unfold the shadow of Japan once again loomed over China in 1931 they sent roughly 45,000 men to occupy Chinese Manchuria with no troops to spare the Kuomintang was forced to concede without resistance Chiang now understood that he needed to defeat the CPC before China was fully invaded to this end Chang assembled the largest Kuomintang army yet And in 1934 encircled Mao's guerrilla forces stationed in the mountains The climax of this episode was the long march which began when the CPC devised a near Suicidal plan to break through Shang's encirclement and march over 6,000 miles to regroup in the north About half of the CPC's forces were lost when crossing the Xiong river a decision which the 28 Bolsheviks shouldered Responsibility for in the wake of this debacle mount took control of the Communists By the time the remnants of the CPC reached their northern destination only 10 percent of them were still alive Prompting now to launch a massive recruitment effort Recognizing that if the Japanese invaded both day and the Kuomintang would be destroyed Mao sought to form yet another United Front Shang was vehemently opposed to the offer but his generals weren't they took matters into their own hands taking Shang hostage and pressuring him to accept Mao's offer Chiang eventually decided to accept and formed what was called the second United Front in 1937 when Japan did invade that year the Kuomintang proved unable to fully repulse the invaders something which worried the Chinese people and now capitalized on this discontent to recruit even more men to his cause Furthermore his forces did not engage those of Japan very frequently allowing the Kuomintang to bear the of the Japanese onslaught After Japan surrendered to the Allies in 1945 The Kuomintang and CPC ended the second United Front It only took one year for the Chinese Civil War to rage on yet again the CPC was now armed with Leftover Japanese weapons and equipment had newfound support from the populace and faced a foe who suffered 3.2 million casualties Against the Japanese whereas the Communists lost approximately four hundred and forty thousand after a highly successful guerrilla campaign both Beijing and Nanking had fallen to the Communists with the capture of these two major cities It would not be long before Mao was victorious and the People's Republic of China was established Chiang kai-shek and the defeated Kuomintang government went into exile in Taiwan in 1949 which to this day still

       " ' This video is sponsored by \"Brilliant\"; more on that later. Hi, I\\'m Griffin Johnson, the Armchair Historian. Today\\'s video: What was life like in Nazi Germany? When one tries to imagine what life was like for the average German between the years of 1933 and 1945, what comes to mind? Many would likely envision it as a drab nightmarish totalitarian dystopia, and in many ways this was true, certainly for the sections of society that the Nazi\\'s firmly repressed, but how much different was life like for the Germans who lived up to Hitler standards? Before we address the life of the average citizen, we must first understand what life was like for minorities, and as can be imagined the rights of these groups were essentially eliminated, almost as soon as Hitler took power in 1933. Jewish civil servants such as teachers, professors, engineers, and administrators were excluded from government employment within the first few months of Hitler\\'s election. The Nazis used their newly acquired power to orchestrate what would be known as \"Kristallnacht\" or \"Crystal Night\" in which thousands of Jewish businesses, homes, and synagogues were burned or otherwise vandalized, their owners beaten and arrested. By 1941 almost all of Germany\\'s remaining Jewish population, which 10 years earlier had numbered over half a million, were imprisoned in concentration camps. The Nazis embarked on an ideologically-fueled campaign against virtually all minorities and marginal groups of society including gypsies, homosexuals, Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, and ethnic Slavs. One of the methods used in this campaign was forced sterilization. In the words of Richard Evans in his book \"The Third Reich in Power\" \"In essence the Nazi regime was using Sterilization to crush those areas of society that did not conform to the Nazi ideal.\" Another particular aspect of this campaign that has been written about repeatedly, is the Nazis eugenics program which sought to systematically breed out those the Nazis deemed \"untermenschen\" or subhuman. For example, state-appointed physicians were authorized and instructed to euthanize children that were considered, by the Nazis, to be unworthy of life. Up to one-hundred thousand Germans including twenty-thousand children were euthanized between 1939 and 1941. Now that we understand the experiences of those the Nazis persecuted, let\\'s examine how life was for everyday citizens. While the role of men in society under the new regime was not much different from that of the previous, one women experienced a variety of new expectations the Nazis introduced what they saw as traditional German values for women, which included modesty, dedication to Christian (in this case Nazified) values, and most importantly the production of children, which the Nazis viewed as a crucial component of their plans to expand the German nation. In fact, a civil award: a German Mother\\'s Cross, was established and given to women who bore at least four children. In schools, students were taught a curriculum that was designed to encourage discrimination and discourage racial mixing. To quote Richard Evans again: \"Teachers and pupils greet each other at the beginning and end of every lesson with the Nazi salute.\" The pupils listen to major political speeches on the radio in the school hall.\" As we mentioned, the primary objective of the Nazi school system was to ensure that the party\\'s ideology became ingrained in the minds of students, something which was intended to produce loyal soldiers for future wars. Dating all the way back from 1922, the Hitler Youth and later on its female branch, the League of German Girls, was meant to prepare boys for military service and girls for motherhood. These organizations were incredibly popular in Germany and by 1939, over 90 percent of Germany\\'s children were part of the Hitler Youth. During this time, even more innocuous institutions of German society began to take a National Socialists slant, as can be seen with the positive Christianity movement, which was a state-sponsored program to unite all of Germany\\'s Protestant churches into one national church that would legitimize and support the Nazi agenda. Government, under the direction of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, distributed millions of inexpensive radios to the people in order to make sure that important political messages could reach them. These measures, however, often did not produce the desired effect, as most people were only interested in carrying on daily life as it had existed before. Recognizing that most of the German people could not be fully indoctrinated, the government enforced its ideal German state through legislation. For example, it was required for both men and women aged 19 to 25 to commit a six-month tour of public labor, in which they fulfilled the Nazi concept of a social labor force. Women were then allowed to return home, but men were conscripted into the Wehrmacht or German military. This provided a steady source of manpower for the ultra-militaristic Nazi state. The Nazis also introduced the \"Volkswagen\" or \"People\\'s car\", which was intended to provide each German  household with a vehicle, as part of Hitler\\'s campaign to motorize Germany. In regards to economics, the Great Depression was taking a disastrous toll on the German people before the Nazis were elected. By 1933, unemployment stood at 35 percent and inflation was rampant. Naturally, the Nazis promised to improve the state of the German economy, something which earned them many votes in the election of 1933. Their first priority was to reduce the dismal amount of unemployment in Germany by initiating large public works projects such as the construction of canals and the \"Autobahn\" or \"Highway\". Hitler boasted his success in spite of the fact that many of the employment statistics that were used excluded significant portions of the population such as Jews and soldiers. Though the Nazis economic reforms have generally been considered effective, it took years for the unemployment rate to actually drop to stable levels. Despite promising peace, both during and after his election, Hitler would once again involve the German people in a large-scale war. As the need for resources to power the German military grew larger and larger, more countries were subjected to Hitler\\'s conquest, something which escalated the war onto a global scale. As the conflict raged on, it quickly became apparent to most observers, even those within Germany, that the idealistic utopia that the Nazis hoped for would never come to fruition. The sheer number of casualties that the war produced, especially on the Eastern Front was overwhelming. When defeat finally did arrive, it would take nearly a half-century before life would return to normal, as the country was divided between the Democratic West and the Communist East, until they were reunited in 1990. One of the scientists who fled Germany in the 1930\\'s was none other than Albert Einstein. Our sponsor for today, \"Brilliant\", allows you to master the kind of problem-solving and logic that would have been familiar to Einstein himself. Jumping into science, math, and physics sounds like an extremely daunting task, especially for an armchair historian like yourself, but \"Brilliant\" allows you to learn these concepts through fun bite-sized problems.

rise to power Prussia need not have existed the world could have done without it but it wanted to exist no one had invited that small country into the circle of European great powers it demanded acceptance and pushed its way in Sebastian Hafner rise and fall of Prussia today we'll be examining one question just how was Prussia able to climb the ladder to the top of the european power hierarchy despite being one of myriad principalities that composed the holy roman empire as always to answer our central question we'll need to provide some context contrary to what you might think though this story is not one that begins amid these slopes of northern Germany or along the windswept beaches of the Baltic Sea rather it begins in 12th century Accra beneath the sweltering Mediterranean Sun ten years before the turn of the century a religious order known as the Teutonic Knights had been formed being charged with controlling aquas portholes they did not stay there for long however relocating to Transylvania in 1211 to assist the Hungarians against the ever encroaching humans during the latter half of the 13th century the Teutons roundup fighting alongside the polish against the pagans inhabiting the baltic coast we can see right off the bat that this society of warriors would go anywhere there was fortune to be won but there was something peculiar about the Baltic coast it was a time of Christianisation and colonization along North Germany something that became appealing to the covetous band of mercenary Crusaders but colonizing the Baltic in the region of Prussia was no easy task the process was significantly more brutal and involved the near total extermination of the native people known as the old Prussians consequently little information about the history and language of the original Prussians survives to this day it would take hundreds of years until there no more pagans to take the sword and cross to and the order eventually became embroiled in a sequence of wars with Poland and Lithuania hostilities ceased after the second piece of thorn in 1466 and the order lost its independence to Poland West Prussia was taken over entirely and East Prussia remained under the orders jurisdiction but was officially recognized as a fief of Poland in 1525 Grand Master Albrecht von Poisson brought about an end to the order he led converting to Protestantism and installing himself as Duke of Prussia in order to elevate himself to the status of a feudal ruler this would be an easy transition as Albrecht already had kinsmen in power and he was part of the house home and so learn the ruling family of Brandenburg a small German state based around Berlin a union between the two states seemed inevitable but it would take almost a century for the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg to inherit Prussia in 1618 the new ruler of Prussia a direct Frederick died airless and John Sigismund the ruler of Brandenburg would use that opportunity to finally inherit the Duchy forming the country of brandenburg-prussia what followed after this union was the combined States involvement in the 30 Years War by the time the devastating conflict ended in 1648 the Hohenzollerns were in control of five geographically disconnected strips of territory that's right border war doesn't just happen in paradox games it was even worse in reality each principality had its own laws and customs and the nobility of each wanted to retain as much power as possible it would take the great elector Frederick Vilhelm to contend with these challenges in the mid 17th century and although no territorial gains were made though homs' rule did see East Prussia being liberated from Poland and being placed under his direct control in the wake of the Swedish polish war but it would be the destiny of his son to wear the crown of a king not his own that son was known as Frederick the first the King in Prussia as of 1701 Frederick was a great patron of the arts and science he was considered excessively extravagant by some accounts including that of his grandson Frederick the Great certainly the more famous Prussian King before we discussed his rule we do need to cover the reign of Frederick Vilhelm the first known as the soldier king men i esteem above the greatest riches Frederick vilhelm declared before long one in every nine men was made a soldier increasing the size of the Prussian army 283 thousand men to maximize the amount of potential recruits the soldier King welcome two new immigrants into Prussia even constructing schools and hospitals to accommodate this wave of emigration but this was not unusual for Prussia even before Frederick ville Homs reign one-third of Berliners consisted of Frenchmen in the year 1700 many of them French Protestants furthermore waves of Protestant refugees from South Germany fled to Prussia each year to escape religious prosecution in Haffner's words this state created for itself a people at people of immigrants who upon arrival found a ready-made state and a ready-made administration and had their land assigned to them fertile land a land of unlimited opportunity for those who worked hard and efficiently even though his temper was a thing to be feared Frederick Vilhelm was an effective and detail-oriented ruler who left his son a burgeoning economic and military power one poised to expand its reach much like his father one of the first actions Frederick the Great took was increasing the Prussian army this time to a hundred thousand men a number that doubled during wartime but how is he able to accomplish this the answer is Prussian thrift which involved four-fifths of Prussia state revenue being spent on the army as French writer Voltaire poet where some states have an army the Prussian army has a state despite what you might think this absurd investment in the Prussian army did pay off as Frederick succeeded in seizing Silesia from the Austrians and West Prussia finally from the Polish during the Seven Years War he defended Prussia from a coalition that included Austria France and Russia three of the biggest military powers at the time military conquests aside Frederick the Great is considered a quintessential example of an enlightened despot having been a devotee of the humanities as a youth he was keen to and patronized his favorite artists and philosophers Frederic was in some respects a combination of his father and grandfather combining the best elements of both of his predecessors to claim his place in history in the 19th century Prussia continued to expand although it was subdued by Napoleon along with the majority of Europe Prussia regained much of its territory and even gained new holdings by the end of it though including the coal replete roar at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 about 50 years later Prussia became the core of the North German Confederation as well as its successor the German Empire but that's a topic for another

       " \" this video is sponsored by brilliant more on that later hi I'm Griffin Johnson dear armchair historian today's video was the prussian army really as good is that one kid who wears a pickle hob to school thinks it was [Music] during the 18th century the Kingdom of Prussia became renowned for its almost a legendary military however as with anything in history there's often exaggeration and misinterpretation today we'll be examining whether the Prussian armies reputation as one of the most effective fighting forces in all of European history is well-deserved or merely the product of popular imagination [Music] to assist us in answering this question we will be examining three aspects of the Prussian Army structure tactics and military successes let's start with structure namely the Prussian command system under the leadership of Frederick William the first the soldier King Frederick's first course of action as King of Prussia was dismissing the majority of his court from the previous ruler and inviting numerous military reformers Frederick recognized that a large army needed competent officers and in 1716 he founded Prussia's first cadet school the cadet in house the cadet training program was open to only members of the Prussian nobility at the time also known as the Yonkers this meant that while Prussian leaders had adequate training their positions were not always earned with merit but with status officers are nothing without men to lead and so in 1733 Frederick William the first turned his attention by introducing the Canton conscription system in which Prussia was divided into small regions containing about five thousand households each every able-bodied male was added to a list of potential recruits and soon this meant that Prussia would have the fourth largest army in Europe while this allowed the Prussians to count themselves as one of the major military powers on the continent they still had not developed a reputation for discipline and tactical innovation still when compared to the armies of France and Austria where the service of enlisted men was voluntary and commissions were mostly purchased we can easily say that the Prussian system was remarkably efficient the next task of these soldier King was to make the Prussian army as disciplined and effective as possible there were three most visible innovations implemented under Frederick's rule we'll start with the first the iron ramrod the first question some of you may be asking is how could an iron ramrod increase battlefield efficiency the simple answer is that as opposed to the wooden ramrod the iron ramrod didn't break in battle something which otherwise would happen frequently as for the second innovation whereas other nations generally trained their men to fire a maximum of three rounds per minute Jews of frederick william's army were relentlessly drilled to fire up to six shots per minute which was an unheard-of number at the time and although this rate of fire was impossible to achieve during the chaos of battle and in fact could barely be achieved on the parade ground it didn't sure that the Prussians would be firing at a greater volume than their opponents even if it was only one shot long the third and most iconic innovation of the Prussian army was the goose-step a marching style that at first glance looks comical but to be highly advantageous on the 18th and 19th century battlefield introduced by the great reformer Prince Leopold of unhaul Dessau in the 1740s it was intended to keep soldiers marching at the same pace in battle making it easier for commanders to maneuver and maintain control of their armies by contrast the marching orders of other European armies made their formations liable to dissolve in combat Prussian military innovations didn't stop there and the cavalry arm of the Prussian army excelled in its role as a shock force it was noted for its aggressiveness as can be seen with the deaths head or totin cop huh Tsar's considering all of these points it is apparent that the Prussian army excelled in its use of tactics the development of tactics means nothing unless they can be implemented correctly on the battlefield a skill which requires a great general for the Prussians theirs would be the successor of the soldier King none other than frederick the great frederick inherited in the words of tim Blanding author of frederick the great king of prussia a large well-equipped and well-trained army a loyal nobility accustomed to serve and efficient administration and a budget large enough to allow a war to be waged without additional taxation or loans Frederick personally commanded the army at many battles and for our purposes we'll be examining his three greatest victories corn Friedberg rose Bach and lutein the latter two of these battles contain examples of the Prussians using the advanced tactics we've previously discussed while the former can be used to demonstrate the efficacy of the Prussian cavalry the Battle of Houghton Friedberg fought during the 2nd Silesian war against Austria was Frederick's first major victory and the moniker which we still use when referring to him today during this confrontation a force of around fifty nine thousand Prussians defeated a combined Ostrow sub out sixty three thousand men the battle is mostly remembered for its conclusion in which a single Regiment of Prussian heavy cavalry rounded most of the enemy's lines capturing over two thousand prisoners six months after this decisive victory the Prussians and Austrians signed a peace treaty that ensured Prussia would have control of Silesia the next great victory was the Battle of RoSPA fought during the Seven Years War this battle only lasted an hour and a half and more notably it was won by a Prussian force of 22,000 against an Ostrow French force of 42,000 Frederick was able to execute a series of complex maneuvers that required his troops to march in total unison with one another something achieved with the iconic new step Frederick was then able to outflank his enemies using a tactic known as oblique order applying pressure with well-disciplined volleys on the enemy's flank and crushing them with a final cavalry charge the final great victory we will mention today occurred exactly one month after the Battle of RoSPA near the Silesian village of Luton employing many of the same tactics that he used in the previous battle Frederick's army of 33,000 decisively defeated an austrian force yet again the battle is notable for featuring one of the greatest displays of Prussian discipline in the entire Seven Years War in which two lines of Prussian grenadiers is marched perfectly spaced against the Austrians the outcome of the battle ensured that Austria would be unable to participate in the rest of the Seven Years War thereby securing Prussian victory we can then conclude from these battles that Frederick the great reputation is well deserved however it should be understood that Frederick's military reforms were not perfect in particular artillery was the branch of the Prussian military that was never used to its full potential Frederick did recognize this later on in his military career and was one of the first leaders to adopt horse artillery but the cultivation of Prussian artillery would be overshadowed later on by a young Corsican lieutenant after the death of Frederick in 1786 his army began to mine into decadence and mediocrity for the remainder of the century the shock of the Prussian defeat at llena in 1806 at the hands of Napoleon inspired the military establishment to undertake a series of comprehensive reforms under the leadership of General Gerhard von Scharnhorst the Prussian army opened the officer corps to the middle class which by 1830 allowed Prussia to again become a formidable military power further reforms to strategy and doctrine occurred under the renowned Helmut von Moltke who emphasized initiative and rapid movement all of these reforms allow the Prussians to crush the Danes in 1864 the Austrians in 1866 and the French in 1870 which paved way for German unification in 1871 in order to fund his armies Frederick Vilhelm the first shut down the Prussian Academy of Sciences allowing educational institutions in Britain and France to surpass it but when Frederick the Great came to power the

has been maintained by just four states sweden norway denmark and the last obvious one russia but only sweden was able to form an empire and tightly control the entire region for almost a century this raises the question how was Sweden able to consolidate its hold in Scandinavia and triumph against its neighbors namely Denmark which at one point loosely controlled Sweden Norway and parts of Finland in order to understand Sweden's assent to Empire status we need to travel back to the end of the 14th century when Sweden along with Norway were ruled by the king of Denmark and what was known as the Kalmar Union it would take more than a century for the Swedes under King Gustav the first Vasa to successfully break away from Danish rule in 1523 approximately three years later who solved the first embraced Protestantism but it's not because he wanted to get rid of his wife rather he needed funding for his emergent Kingdom after waging one costly war after the next in opposition to Denmark Gustav needed an answer to the question of mounting debt Lutheranism provided a convenient and somewhat Viking solution as it precipitated the confiscation of church properties and gave him access to an unprecedented source of funds with his economic situation improving Gustav would need to likewise improve his military if he wanted to fulfill his grand ambition to control the Baltic Rim and taking money from Swedish churches proved to be an unsustainable source of income these problems were solved by the development of the merchant class and the capture of Russian ports by the middle of the sixteenth century the Swedish military and the Swedish population as a whole needed a leader that would inspire and provide the military with a vision to fulfill as you may have guessed from the thumbnail of our video this leader was none other than Gustavus Adolphus degre who had near single-handedly transformed Sweden into an empire born in 1594 Gustavus or as he was known in Swedish King Gustav ii Adolphe in herre the Swedish throne at only 16 at an age when most of us are concerned about getting a driver's license Gustavus had to worry about three ongoing Wars he inherited against Denmark Poland and Russia there was no limit to Gustavus courage he often directed his troops on the front line disregarding his own safety and thanks to the example he set and his emphasis on instilling discipline in his troops Gustavus found success in two of the three wars he inherited even before the after mention conflicts were over he had involved Sweden in one of the bloodiest Wars in European history the 30 Years War this massive conflict was the result of religious disputes in the Holy Roman Empire between Protestants and Catholics and in 1630 Sweden joined the side of the Protestants inflating what was originally a widespread religious revolt into a complete European total war before we examine Sweden's success in the 30 Years War we must first understand Gustavus military innovations as we described in our video why did soldiers fight in lines European armies during the early modern era were deployed in squares of pikemen and Musketeers until the widespread adoption of linear tactics a system developed by Maurice of Nassau while maurices linear system was more effective than the pike square which preceded it it was not perfect Gustavus would fine-tune this method and his model would remain in use until the French Revolution almost entirely unchanged Gustavus reforms did not stop there he improved logistics systems developing the General Staff reorganizing cavalry units and professionalizing artillerymen these reforms along with his martial ability would bring him repeated victories in the 30 Years War so many in fact that Napoleon considered him one of the greatest generals in history Gustavus himself commanded the Swedes successfully at several battles during the war most notably at Brighton felled in 1631 and lützen in 1632 the latter of which resulted in his death even with Gustavus gone however this sharmee continued to be successful on the battlefield and in 1655 when the 30 Years War ended the kingdom of Sweden controlled several small German states after the death of Gustavus Sweden was in a precarious position due to the incompetence of Gustavus successors Christina and Charles the 10th Gustav despite their ineffectiveness the Swedish military was still effective and in the 1650s Sweden would again go on to win victories against its rivals Poland Denmark and Russia but as the 18th century drew nearer Sweden's military dominance in northern Europe and Eastern Europe would begin to decline just as many European nations adopted Swedish military tactics this ultimately eliminated Sweden's long-standing martial advantage although Sweden did participate in more limited conflicts during the reign of charles xi who held the throne during the later parts of the 17th century most of the king's energy during this time was spent on reforming the bureaucracy and nobility of the country charles the 11th most notable accomplishment was his conversion of the swedish government from a semi parliamentary state to a near absolute monarchy which allowed him to reform the country's budgetary process and thus provide more funds for future Wars charles xi died at the age of 41 leaving his 15 year old son charles the 12th as king and it was at this point where sweden would never fully recover a mere three years after charles the 12th was crowned the enemies of sweden including russia and poland decided to take advantage of the king's inexperience and declared war this conflict which would be known as the great northern war would last over 20 years sweden was initially successful in war but the tide turned quickly after the disasters Battle of Poltava which resulted in the capture of almost the entire swedish army to add insult to injury the danish decided to make several incursions into swedish territory it was while fighting the danes that charles himself was killed in battle in 1718 approximately a decade after Poltava the great northern war continued until 1721 but the Swedes saw no further successes when the war ended Sweden had lost ingria Estonia and Livonia to the Russians and several small Scandinavian territories to the Danes and it was in that year 1721 that marked the end of the Swedish Empire Sweden would continue to play a role in European affairs throughout the 18th and 19th centuries but its role would remain a minor one due to continued defeat at the hands of its neighbors by the end of the Napoleonic Wars Sweden took a stance of neutrality which persisted during both of the world wars to our sponsor recently Squarespace has made my life a

George the settlement that grew around this region became the thriving city of Madras now known as Chennai and home to over seven million people as more and more company owned forts and settlements sprang up all over the Indian subcontinent the English became a leading exporter of spices which in the words of Brien Gardner author of the East India Company had a considerable place in life men were prepared to die in search of them and many did no gift was more acceptable and to be well supplied was a mark of status wealth could be measured in spices the French Danish and Dutch all became similarly active in Indian Affairs from the 17th century onwards with the Portuguese already established in the region joining me now is our good friend history with Hilbert who will be providing us with some background information on the Mughal Empire as the 18th century commenced the Europeans became increasingly involved in Indian Affairs they could afford to because the Mughal Empire which once ruled over not just the majority of India but also parts of modern-day Pakistan Afghanistan and Bangladesh was on the decline in the wake of very costly wars of conquest the Mughals suffered from repeated invasions by Persians Afghans and other Indians in 1739 the Mughal capital Delhi was sacked by the Persian ruler Nader Shah following the decisive battle of Colonel and in 1748 nada Shahs Protege the Afghan Ahmed Shah Durrani also led his armies into Mughal territory beginning his own invasion due to these factors by the middle of the 18th century the Mughal emperor took the role of a figurehead to many new empowered local rulers if you'd like to check out my video that goes into more detail about the Mughals then follow the link in the description below thanks for joining us again however as the Mughals weakened the Maratha Kingdom in the central west of India was carving out an empire of its own despite never eclipsing the Mughal Empire at its height the Maratha Empire remained as a dominant power in India for another 80 years or so as all this was happening the East India Company began to overshadow its European competitors devoting substantial profits to raising a private army in an effort to contend with the Maratha Empire and Bengal by now the East India Company benefited greatly from the country's imposing Navy which enabled it to ferry more and more men to India than its European competitors as much as the company's military aided in its growth it was the laissez-faire policy that won over many local rulers to their side many of whom benefited financially from their dealings with the company and did not perceive their sovereignty to be at risk of all the Europeans who have established themselves in India the British and French based in the South were now preeminent but under the daring Robert Clive the British East India Company's army was able to defeat both the Bengal E's and their French allies at the Battle of Plassey during the Seven Years War which by the 1760s allowed them to assert control over much of the Indian subcontinent unchecked through direct territorial possession or indirect tributary arrangements to quote Gardner once more by the Treaty of Paris 1763 the French forts taken by the company were returned to them some of them having been razed to the ground but the French never recovered and only six years later the French East India Company collapsed although the stations remained in the possession of France during the British advance into the indian heartland it encountered staunch resistance from the Sikh Empire and other Indian states not interested in doing business with the English the Duke of Wellington who would later go on to defeat Napoleon won several victories against these states while eating his brother Richard WA Leslie who acted as governor-general of India consequently by the turn of the 19th century the Wesley brothers had succeeded in leaving behind them the foundations of an empire greater even that of Akbar himself as the middle of the 19th century drew closer and Indian national consciousness began to take form as company rule resulted in a wider array of social and economic reforms being demanded from increasingly alienated local rulers these sentiments culminated in the Indian rebellion of 1857 also known as the sepoys mutiny which was brutally suppressed and concluded with the formal dissolution of the Mughal Empire and the transfer of power from the British East India Company to Britain itself power now rested in the hands of the British crown directly and as the 19th century continued India's resources and the livelihoods of its people were exploited to fuel the industrial revolution in Britain leading to a series of famines which shook the Indian economy to the core and left millions of Indians dead one thing was certain the British Empire now had millions of new subjects under its rule in India an imperial expansion wouldn't stop there to conclude the political vacuum left by the Mughal Empire in the wake of repeated invasions the failure of other Indian states particularly the Maratha Empire to fill that vacuum and unify India the failure of other European powers to stop the British Britain's military and industrial superiority and the governing policy of the East India Company allowed Britain to take over the Indian

Arthur Hesse Ottis author of the extraordinary rise of the Russian Empire Ivan the fourths attack on remnant elements of the old feudal system appears to have been aimed at eliminating those remaining elements that resisted the consolidation of centralized autocratic power this and the expansion of the muscovite state caused Ivan to declare himself Tsar or Caesar of all Russia in that same year of 1547 under Ivan's rule Russia's territory expanded by over one and a half million square miles when Ivan died in 1584 he left his kingdom to his son and namesake his beloved Ivan Ivanovich no way he killed that one he left his kingdom to Theodore who died heirless 14 years later what followed was a period of political turmoil and famine known as the Time of Troubles this unfortunate chapter in Russia's story lasted until 1613 when Michael Rahman off was elected Tsar by a grand council comprised of nobles and peasants alike the Romanovs led Russia out of the Time of Troubles and in 1672 Michael's grandson Peter would go on to turn Russia into an empire Peter who would go on to earn the title the Great was forward-looking from the start being tutored by foreigners he embarked on a tour of Western Europe shortly before the turn of the 17th century Peter was particularly impressed by the shipyards and vessels of the Dutch so much so that it is believed that the tricolor flag of Russia was inspired by the Dutch flag in France and England Peter was enthralled by the idea of planned cities and he took a liking to Western architecture as soon as he returned Peter began enacting reforms that would modernize Russia and turn it into a great power Peters tour of Europe made him realize how archaic Russia's bureaucracy was in order to imitate the absolutism of such monarchs as louis xiv peter expanded the jurisdiction of his government placing monopolies on imported goods and levying comprehensive taxes in 1703 he ordered the construction of st. Petersburg on the Baltic coast which was to be the new capital of Russia the city incorporated the most modern Western designs and also served as a trading hub facilitating contact with the rest of Europe at long last Russia's doors were wide open to the rest of Europe Peter also waged war to strengthen Russia's from 1700 to 1721 Russia was embroiled in two great northern war against Sweden the war was a resounding success for the Russians and their allies stripping Sweden of her status as a great power and paving the way for Russian expansion in the future it was immediately after the war in 1721 that Peter enacted his most important reforms first he declared Russia and Empire designating himself as Emperor a title which he felt was more appropriate for his expanded state secondly he wrote the table of ranks which organized Russian society into a relatively loose social pyramid one in which peasants and other commoners could rise by serving the state were acquiring wealth the table which was based on similar systems being used in Prussia and Denmark increased the efficiency of the Russian government and promoted Talent it would go on to be used for nearly 200 years unto the Russian Revolution the next great Russian monarch would be the renowned Catherine the Great Catherine was highly educated and appreciated the arts as such she attempted to modernize Russian culture by constructing opera houses and schools like Peter she sought to introduce enlightenment-era ideas to the government but her attempts encountered some resistance from the nobility still under Catherine the Russian Empire grew even mightier than before as it expanded into Poland pushed the Ottomans out of Crimea and took the first steps in colonizing Alaska Catherine died in 1796 just before the start of the Napoleonic Wars another event which would profoundly affect Russia and culminate in the destruction of Moscow the turn of the 19th century marked the beginning of the end of the russian empire following the defeat of Napoleon Russia saw almost a century of civil unrest which was provoked by the continued failure of Russia to adapt to changes in technology and philosophy the lackluster performance of the Imperial Russian army and the Crimean War with its logistical failures and lack of morale perfectly illustrated the increasing inefficiencies of the government there was a belated attempt to industrialize the over agrarian economy in 1861 with the emancipation of the serfs or Russian peasants by emperor alexander ii although the emancipation was responsible for roughly 200 percent growth in the economy between the year it was announced and 1900 Russia's economic power still paled in comparison to the other great powers of Europe and the former serfs remained impoverished professor Michael T Florence key in his book the end of the Russian Empire notes that the average yearly expenditure of a peasant was fifty four point ninety two rubles were about twenty seven dollars the peasant family sometimes a large one lived in a space of some two thousand four hundred to three thousand cubic feet or 200 square feet the precursory disaster that would contribute to the fall of the Russian Empire was the russo-japanese war which lasted from 1904 to 1905 needless to say Russia's defeat was humiliating and the war triggered dissatisfaction with both the government and reigning emperor nicholas ii culminating in the revolution of 1905 a forerunner to the revolution of 1917 the final straw however would prove to be the first world war in 1917 three years after the start of the conflict near anarchy broke out when workers began to strike and the army experienced widespread mutiny the revolution of 1917 ended with the abdication of nicholas ii and in early 1918 the Treaty of brest-litovsk ended Russia's involvement in the first world war at the cost of more than one and a half million casualties although control of Russia continued to be contested between revolutionaries and counter revolutionaries for the next four years it was apparent to all observers that the Russian Empire declared by Peter the Great was over the key events that led to the creation of the Russian Empire can be attributed the following the rise of Muscovy in the wake of the Mongol invasion the stability provided by the Rama of dynasty after the Time of Troubles and most importantly the reforms of Catherine and Peter the great Peter the Great led Russia at a time when getting a basic education was a privilege under some of the world's best tutors and

       " ' Today\\'s video is sponsored by NordVPN, the world\\'s leading Virtual Private Network company protecting millions of people on the internet every day. Hi, I\\'m Griffin Johnson, the Armchair Historian. Today\\'s episode: why Italy was so incompetent during the Second World War. This should be fun. Fascist Italy\\'s military has long been the target of ridicule aimed at its lack of competence and commitment to duty. In this video we\\'ll be evaluating the factors that inhibited the Italian military during the Second World War, and examine whether or not the poor reputation of fascist Italy\\'s military, which continues to this day largely in the form of internet memes, is entirely deserved. Now, let\\'s begin by providing a bit of context. Joining me today is Potential History to do just that. Potential History: Since 1922, Italy was under the leadership of Benito Mussolini, known as Il Duce, or \"the leader\". What Il Duce imagined was nothing less than the restoration of the Roman Empire, an ambition even Hitler prodded going as far as to call him \"one of the Caesars\". Now, although I\\'m sure that big chin himself meant every word of his intentions, in reality It turned out... Well, I won\\'t spoil it for you... Bad. It turned out very bad. Even though there were clearly grand ambitions behind the troops Mussolini sent to the field, The fact of the matter was, that they received substandard equipment. Including thinly armored and very undergunned tanks. If you want to learn more specifically about Italian armor, check out my video in the description below. Armchair Historian: Let\\'s start by analysing Italy\\'s leadership during the Second World War. Naturally, we\\'ll start with big chin himself. Mussolini was eager to get involved, but Pietro Badoglio and Italo Balbo, two of his top marshals, advised him to be patient. In his mind, there was no doubt that the world would soon be subjected to Axis rule and he was hoping to secure a territory for Italy. As a result, Mussolini ignored his army\\'s logistical deficiencies, which became very apparent just two weeks into the Italian invasion of France. This was exacerbated by the lack of equipment, some of which had been lost due to Mussolini\\'s involvement in wars in Spain and East Africa. To make matters worse the Italian High Command was simply not up to par with those of the other Great Powers. Many of Mussolini\\'s marshals only gained their positions because of their political affiliation and personal loyalty rather than military experience. Incompetence was not limited to the upper echelons of the command structure, however. MacGregor Knox in his book on the subject provides the following explanation as to why. [quote on screen] This translated into a widespread failure to adapt to the changing nature of combat, with many officers preparing their soldiers for First World War era scenarios, and equipping them with outdated weapons. In terms of industrial capacity and natural resources, Italy was also at a disadvantage. To give you an idea of how dire the situation truly was at one point, the Italian infantry divisions were short, roughly 15,000 contemporary artillery guns, but the Italian military factories could only produce 8 percent of that number in a year. Furthermore, the artillery that was available to the Italian soldiers was often defective in some way. In Frank Joseph\\'s book, He quotes an Australian soldier, Robert Donovan, who professed that: [quote on screen] Throughout the war, the industries of Britain and its allies out-competed Italian industries in producing artillery, aircraft, and ships alike. And much like Germany, Italy suffered from a dearth of natural resources, like coal and oil, that were needed to power those factories in the first place. Now that we understand that both Italy\\'s command and resource output were inferior to its neighbours\\', let\\'s analyse Italy\\'s forces and equipment. The Navy was by far the best thing that Italy had going for it. Its presence in the Mediterranean Sea was imposing. Its destroyers, submarines, and torpedo boats outnumbering those of Britain and France in the region. But the Navy suffered from two significant drawbacks. Number one: It was hindered by fuel shortages, and number two: like the infantry, it could not depend on the Air Force. This is largely a result of the Air Force\\'s disorganized state, being composed of myriad aircraft types like the infantryman barring World War 1 era weapons, some Italian pilots were forced to fly in outdated biplanes, even during the final stages of the war. Not to mention, in September 1939 less than half of Italy\\'s planes were operational. But of all three military branches, one could easily make the argument that ground forces suffer the most from equipment and supply shortages. In 1940, only about a quarter of Italy\\'s divisions were supplied with a sufficient amount of weapons and rations. Those weapons that did make it into the hands of these soldiers were at times outdated, with the newly adopted Carcano rifle being sometimes exchanged for World War one era rifles because of its limited range, accuracy, and jamming issues. What\\'s more, as of 1937 each Infantry Division was composed of only two Infantry regiments instead of three. Thus as the total numbers of divisions increased, the fighting capacity of each division decreased. Each of these new divisions needed a new commander as well, and Italy suffered from a sort of marshal brain drain. Granted, the binary system did provide each Italian division with more maneuverability, but this advantage was nullified by the fact that the Italians were facing motorised enemies on the battlefield. By en-large, Italian divisions were non-motorized as the country did not have the industrial capacity to produce automotive parts. On the whole, we can definitively conclude that the Italian military performed poorly during the Second World War. It failed to make a breakthrough in France, failed to invade Greece and Yugoslavia without first soliciting German support, and failed to assert control over North Africa despite outnumbering British forces in Libya ten to one during its planned invasion of Egypt. As such, Italy\\'s string of failures and early capitulation in 1944 can be better attributed to brash leadership, a lack of industrialization, scarce resources, as well as equipment shortages and deficiencies, as opposed to a scarcity of brave and dutiful soldiers. This seems to be the consensus among modern historians. Although in William L. Shirer\\'s book, the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, another less heard of argument is put forth. Shirer points to the lack of popular support among Italian people, who unlike the Germans, never truly embraced fascism to explain the inability of Mussolini\\'s regime to address the problems we\\'ve discussed throughout this video.

video so be sure to check out my southern accent as well if someone were to ask you what is the costliest war in American history how would you answer many would impulsively respond with the Second World War were even Vietnam however this is simply untrue the American Civil War was and still is the costliest conflict in American history in fact up until about fifty years ago the casualties of the Civil War were higher than any other American wars combined but why was this the case there were few automatic weapons no tanks or high explosives I'm griffin Johnson the armchair historian and today we're going to be examining what exactly made the American Civil War so lethal first it must be understood that far more men died of sickness than combat approximately 67% of all civil war casualties were the result of infectious diseases such as measles dysentery and smallpox this was the natural result of assembling so many men from different areas in one location and was exacerbated by the lack of sanitation and fresh water the loss of men to disease had significant implications on the battlefield for example at the Battle of Chancellorsville 5,000 Confederate soldiers were rendered unfit for duty due to small toques contamination that said disease will inevitably cause casualties in any war however combat in the American Civil War was still exceptionally deadly and this was for a variety of reasons the first reason why combat was so deadly was the extensive use of what is perhaps the most infamous munitions of the war the men a ball which was named after its inventor the French army officer Claude HN Monnet before it's invention rifles which were loaded with musket balls were very slow to reload as their ammunition had to fit tightly into the barrel to accommodate the rifling when they solved this problem by designing a hollow conic bullet which fit loosely in the barrel when the rifle was fired the hollow cavity in the projectile expanded allowing the round to fit firmly against the rifle and giving it a spin which drastically increased accuracy and reload speed however the round itself was slow and heavy and could cause immense damage to the body bones that were hit generally shattered necessitating the amputation of limbs in many cases the rifled muskets weren't the only thing that increased battlefield casualties the most formidable weapon in the Arsenal's of both sides was of course field artillery which was valuable in the 19th century battlefield improvements in weapon technology resulted in artillery being both deadlier and more accurate than ever before explosive shells were able to destroy entire platoons if a direct hit occurred and the introduction of rifled artillery such as the parrot gun made such hits much more likely according to eyewitness sergeant Jonathan stow 15s Massachusetts infantry what sites I've seen that I now see around me shells fly past me every few seconds carrying away branches from trees and scattering limbs around I'm in severe pain Fury's how the shells fly I do sincerely hope that I shall not be wounded again by far the factor most responsible for producing casualties in combat however was the employment of linear tactics as can be guessed such accurate and deadly weapons were devastating to the static formations that were employed on the Civil War battlefield most of the commanders of the war had been trained at the United States Military Academy at West Point in fact at least one army at every major battle that was fought during the war was commanded by a West Point graduate including such commanders as ulysses s grant and robert e lee as the doctrine taught at West Point emphasized Napoleonic era direct approach tactics it's no surprise that both sides deployed their forces in lines and it is equally unsurprising that both sides suffered heavy casualties as a result it did not help that many of the generals appointed during the war had no prior military experience and were promoted due to their political positions however it must be understood that there was no better way to fight in open ground at the time in battles where cover could be used commanders usually deployed them and behind for example at the Battle of Antietam 500 Confederates hidden behind trees walls were able to delay the advance of several Union brigades attempting to cross what would later be named Burnside's bridge the quintessential example of the lethality of civil war combat is the infamous advance at the Battle of Gettysburg ordered by Robert evilly known as Pickett's Charge during the assault 12,500 Confederate infantry men advanced one mile across an open field under very heavy Union rifle and artillery fire although some Confederates reached Union lines the assault was ultimately repulsed with the Confederates taking over 6,000 casualties the range and accuracy of rifled muskets ensured that Lee's men would begin suffering heavily well before they reached northern lines and even before it began the Confederates were being subjected to extensive Union bombardment artillery played such a considerable role in the Civil War that according to Craig Simmons in his book the Battle of Gettysburg the artillery barrage is at Gettysburg may well have been the loudest man-made sound on the North American continent until the detonation of the first atomic bomb and in the words of Colonel Joseph Mayo of the 3rd Virginia infantry who fought at Gettysburg the first shot or two flew harmlessly over heads but soon they began to get the range and then came pandemonium first there was an explosion on the top of the tree and in a second there was another followed by piercing shriek two men were killed outright and three frightfully wounded Company F had suffered terribly and a lieutenant had his legs she had a blow the knee towards the end of the war the deadliness of combat on open fields was finally recognized by commanders of both sides accordingly both the north and south began to employ static defensive positions and breastworks as can be seen at the siege of Petersburg which was also one of the first times that the Gatling gun was employed in battle but in a very limited capacity when the First World War arrived fifty years later the American Civil War was finally seen as both foreshadowing trench warfare and representing the transition from close order formations in open ground to open order formations in cover this lesson however came at the cost of six hundred and twenty thousand American lives eight percent of American

video present in order to understand why soldiers fought in lines it also must be understood how line formations and tactics were even developed and for this we have to go back to the early 17th century the man primarily responsible for the widespread introduction of linear formations in Europe was Gustavus Adolphus the second king of Sweden during this period up until that time infantry was deployed on the battlefield in large square columns of pikemen and Musketeers which allowed them to move around the battlefield as one unit and provide equal protection to each flank inspired by a system developed by the Dutch nobleman Maurice of Nassau Gustavus implemented informations designed to maximize firepower as stated by david gates in his book warfare in the 19th century shallow linea formations were clearly more advantageous than deep columnar ones when it came to maximizing the number of troops who could see and the shoot a given target as a result the swedish army was highly successful in the 30 Years War while Gustavus system worked it was not flawless in the words of Professor Archer Jones author of the art of war in the Western world Gustavus scheme had one important drawback its lack of all-round protection provided by the formations based on the square a line that could only face one direction men vulnerable flanks and an assailable rear this however would be remedied by the introduction of the bayonet a short blade that could be attached to the end of a firearm which allowed infantryman to fend off cavalry charges without pikes bayonets were probably invented early in the 1600s but did not become widespread until the 1670s although at first they had to be inserted into the barrel of a firearm this was solved by the invention of the socket bayonet which allowed a musket to be fired with the Baena attached combined with the development of lighter more efficient muskets a company of infantry could protect itself from almost anything although soldiers were better equipped than they had ever been it was still more efficient to fight in-line formations this was for a number of reasons first and most importantly the only way for infantry to repel cavalry charges was by staying in formation when infantry was not in formation they were especially vulnerable as this meant that each man's flanks would be unprotected and exposed to cavalry second it was easier to maneuver large numbers of men in a rigid formation as otherwise they would have been separated and disoriented especially in the smoky environment on the battlefield making them an even better target for cavalry or third as muskets were very inaccurate the only way for soldiers to inflict damage on their opponent was by concentrating all of their fire on one target combat in this era was more about intimidating the enemy and forcing him to retreat from the battlefield and this was often accomplished by Baena and cavalry charges these points were recognized by military theorists and generals in the 19th and 18th centuries and as a result linear formations were used for over 200 years and this was doubly insured by the technologies of the time again quoting David Gates at the end of the 1700s many of the features of ancient warfare still seemed to be present smoothbore guns and either much more accuracy nor reach than the slings bows and ballista that they superseded well for close fighting manual weapons swords bayonets and lances were commonly relied upon that said linear tactics were continuously being improved upon with various drills being developed in order to increase rate of fire and survivability for example the infantry square which solve to the fundamental problem of linear formations the vulnerability of their flanks to cavalry charges during the Napoleonic Wars the British used these square information to great effect most notably at the Battle of Waterloo where companies of British infantry broke multiple French cavalry charges by forming square another significant innovation was the development of light infantry who were trained to spread out and conceal themselves in order to harass the enemy and screen the primary battle formations while remaining safe from cavalry despite these developments it became clear that linear formations would eventually become obsolete with the development of more accurate firearms in the 19th century in the American Civil War for instance one of the reasons for increased flitty of combat was the use of static line formations against highly accurate and deadly munitions such as the minie ball these new weapons could also disrupt cavalry charges at long distance which diminished the use of both massed infantry formations and cavalry alike regardless lines continued to be used in some capacity up until the First World War despite the prolific casualties suffered by units in close order formations during the start of the First World War it should still be understood how effective line formations were in their heyday because as we've previously stated they proved to be a major deterrent against cavalry kept a much-needed order and discipline within the ranks of the thousands of soldiers on the battlefield and allowed armies to channel a high volume of fire into the formations of their enemy in spite of all of these points linear tactics eventually succumbed to the inevitable obsolescence of any method or technology and speaking of technology I want to give a big thank you to our other sponsor of Road microphones for providing us with the video mic Pro we've

       " ' This video was made possible entirely by our supporters on Patreon. Special thanks to my top patrons: Fritz, Jo Crispin, Brandon Huynh and Derek Below. The following account is from Lieutenant J Waller of the 1st Battalion Royal Marines at Bunker Hill Two companies of the 1st Battalion of Marines and part of the 47th Regiment were the first that mounted the breastwork But you would not be displeased when I tell you that I was with those two companies Who drove their bayonets into all that opposed them Nothing could be more shocking than the carnage that followed the storming of this work. We gained a complete victory The Battle of Bunker Hill was one of the many gruesome battles of the American Revolution, a war that lasted a total of eight years approximately the same length as the American Civil War, Spanish-American War and Mexican-American War combined. It\\'s clear then that in many ways The American Revolution was a war of attrition, but unlike prevailing belief The war was not one simply because the British would fight in lines and the Americans were just hide in the bushes. All of America\\'s most decisive victories were won in a conventional manner. But it was in the way that the Americans engaged the British - fighting on their own terms - that allowed them to outlast their enemy I\\'m Griffin Johnson, the Armchair Historian. And today we\\'ll be evaluating the advantages and disadvantages that both sides faced which ultimately decided the outcome of the war Before we get to the video, I highly recommend you guys check out the channel Jabzy on YouTube He\\'s got a lot of videos on all different wars throughout history. Today he released a video on the Haitian Revolution I\\'ll actually be narrating one of his videos this month. So be sure to subscribe and check it out, links are in the description below to begin this topic We\\'ll be comparing three categories in order to evaluate who fielded the better army, starting with leadership. The most notable American leader is of course George Washington appointed commander and of the Continental Army in 1775 Washington was quick to take action. He successfully forced the British garrison out of Boston in 1776 but was defeated and almost captured that same year in New York City. Still, his tactical innovation and strategic prowess are proven in the battles of Trenton, Princeton, and Yorktown, to name a few. The next American General is Horatio Gates. Responsible for the American victories at Saratoga, Gates gained recognition early on. But just as Gates is remembered for Saratoga, he\\'s also remembered for the major defeat suffered at the Battle of Camden, which was a huge blow to American morale. As a consequence he was replaced by the much more competent Nathaniel Greene, a favorite of George Washington who eventually defeated the British in the south Finally, there\\'s Benedict Arnold who captured Fort Ticonderoga, a crucial position in upstate New York. This action would soon be overshadowed, however, by his betrayal of the American cause in the middle of the war On the British side, we have three significant commanders The first is William Howell, the man who led the British to their phyrric [sic] victory at Bunker Hill. After the battle he replaced Thomas Gage as commander-in-chief of the British forces in America Howell would go on to successfully capture Philadelphia, but because of poor communication, this meant that the army of John Burgoyne, another British commander, would be trapped without support and eventually forced to surrender. Shortly after Howell\\'s blunder, he was replaced with Sir Henry Clinton in 1778 who would remain in the position of commander-in-chief for the majority of the war. The last British commander I\\'d like to mention is Charles Cornwallis who was mostly active in New England and the middle colonies and the initial stages of the war but was later reassigned to the southern theater where he made great progress in Georgia and the Carolinas before overextending and being forced to surrender at Yorktown. From this we can infer that the British generals tended to be more experienced and better educated, although this was negated by the presence of other factors such as the sheer distance from Great Britain which delayed the delivery of troops and supplies. In the case of American generals, most of their experience came from the Seven Years War. This would give them superior knowledge of the terrain. Their main disadvantage would be the lack of organization. In terms of pure tactical ability American commanders held a slight advantage as evident in the cunning victories at Trenton and Cowpens. The next category we\\'ll evaluate is troop discipline and tactics. If you\\'ve seen any TV documentary on the American Revolution it\\'s usually stated directly that the Americans were superior in their combat abilities in almost every way just because they utilized guerrilla tactics And while there is some truth to this, it was the Continental Army that won battles and the irregular troops who retreated from those battles It\\'s also said that along with the Minutemen, the Riflemen were game changers on the battlefield But as stated in Battles of the American Revolutionary War of 1775 to 1781 by W. J. Wood, \"at full strength the riflemen could muster, some 960 men - less than 3% of the Army\\'s total numbers.\" I can say confidently then that it\\'s simply untrue that American rifles and militia won the war the American militiamen were untrained, under-equipped, and most importantly, unobligated to fight, oftentimes they would simply leave and go home if they didn\\'t want to fight anymore. A British Redcoat meanwhile could fire much more regularly and was more often than not equipped with a bayonet making for devastating charges. Lastly the British would always have a detachment of elite grenadiers on the right flank which would often break the American line especially if the American forces were composed of militia as seen at the Battle of Camden The last category we\\'ll evaluate is equipment and supplies Infantry equipment was the logistical priority for both the British and American armies The British were armed with the brown bess, a .71 caliber flintlock musket. The Americans on the other hand were mainly equipped with the .69 caliber Charleville musket which was supplied by the French. Both sides did utilize riflemen in the war but of course the Americans were better known for it, wielding the infamous Kentucky long rifle as seen here. We can see then that the only significant differences between each side\\'s army was that of supply - the British supply lines during the majority of the war were stretched very thin, causing them to stay close to ports to receive reinforcements and foodstuffs This constraint also prevented the British armies from pursuing the American forces inward Even when the British could use the ports they captured getting resupplied and reinforced took 1 to 4 months Despite Britain\\'s logistical constraints the Americans were in no better a position. Such can be seen at Washington\\'s Valley Forge encampment where about 2,000 of his 12,000 soldiers died to malnutrition and disease. Losses like this were commonplace in the Continental Army, at least early on. For this reason the British held a slight advantage in supply So with all of this said the British were better disciplined, well-equipped, and led by somewhat competent commanders whereas the Americans lost more battles were short on supplies, under trained, and only compensated by a few notable commanders. How, then, did the British lose? Well, we\\'re forgetting two crucial categories: war support and grand strategy Let\\'s start with war support: the cause of the Patriots had significant support in the colonies The idea of political independence was highly appealing, much more than that of loyalty to the Crown, especially in the north where British financial restrictions hurt American merchants. As the war continued the British were increasingly seen as foreign invaders and the actions of commanders such as Bannister Tarleton helped support this belief Despite this, the Patriots were never fully able to control the entirety of the American countryside as there was a strong core of loyalist supporters of Great Britain Internationally the American cause was more popular, with the French, Spanish, and Dutch all supporting the Patriot cause Though it was more out of a desire to oppose British hegemony than out of appreciation for Republican ideals Some notable figures who really helped America reformed their army where Baron von Steuben and Marquis de Lafayette Something I find really interesting is that the largest battle of the American Revolution was actually fought at Gibraltar and though the British came out victorious, it\\'s just one of many examples of how overextended Britain became as America received more and more international support Indeed the British saw virtually no foreign support during the revolution With regards to strategy the Americans had the edge compared to the British Even if it changed as the war continued. At the outbreak of hostilities the American army fought in a conventional manner, engaging the British on their own terms, and even launching some attacks into Britain\\'s Canadian territories. Needless to say most of these attacks failed, severely crippling American military strength. The British strategy, initially, was to secure the cities of New England, thinking that once the capital of the revolution fell, so too would the morale of the Patriots. Although they did capture most of New England, they were poorly coordinated. This could be seen when William Howell left Burgoyne in upstate New York to face the Continental Army while he captured Philadelphia. He underestimated the strength of the Americans and what followed was one of the largest British military disasters of the time as Burgoyne lost his whole army and was captured. Howell also found that even though Philadelphia was occupied, the Americans hadn\\'t lost their will to fight. After realizing his strategy was not fit for the Americas, he resigned and left Henry Clinton in charge. The second phase of the war took place in the south after Clinton realized that the north was too heavily populated with Patriots. Washington and Nathaniel Greene had revised their strategy after destroying the British at Saratoga, but unfortunately Horatio Gates learned nothing. Gates engaged General Cornwallis in the south in an open pitched battle and lost a huge portion of his men after which he was relieved by Nathaniel Greene. Cornwallis and his staff, emboldened by their victory, continued to push through Georgia and North Carolina. Learning from his previous mistakes, however, Greene slowly pulled Cornwallis away from his supply lines by continuously drawing him into small skirmishes until Cornwallis was forced to abandon his campaign and retreat to the port of Yorktown, where he was trapped by the French Navy with Washington expecting him. By viewing the American Revolution as simply a fight between the British soldier and American soldier, all evidence would point to a British victory. But when you factor in that the Americans had help from tens of thousands of foreign soldiers, and supplies, and were employing brilliant new strategies, you can see that the Americans were able to hold on until the British lost their will to fight. Even though Cornwallis was captured and lost his whole army, the British could have sent another one But they didn\\'t because support for the war was virtually gone, and it is for all of these reasons combined, that the British suffered such a defeat.

       " ' The Battle of Britain was the first large-scale military campaign in history to be fought exclusively in the air and according to many leading historians the confrontation nearly brought Britain to its knees an outcome that undoubtedly would have had a significant influence on the course of the Second World War I\\'m Griffin Johnson the armchair Historian and today I\\'ll be explaining why the Battle of Britain was fought and how the British were able to best their German foes But first a word from our sponsor war thunder.

The game has more than 1,000 historically accurate playable tanks aircraft and ships from the 1930s all the way up to the 1990s the planes that took part in the Battle of Britain are among them. If you want to join the battle the game is available On PC ps4 and Xbox one stay tuned for an exclusive offer from the war thunder team The angry buzzing of the planes increased and the bombs rained down literally rains down we hugged the side of the building Now the fires appeared a large bomb dropped across the river burst and a brilliant orange and then spurted high into the air There were warehouses over there. One by one they caught fire The fire engines clang sharpened and then the air was filled with the great hissing as the water met the flames This was the experience of Quintin Reynolds as recounted in Gavin Mortimer\\'s book the longest night Events such as these were commonplace by the spring of 1941 But by this time the Blitz as it came to be known was drawing to a close. It had been seven months since air combat between Germany and Britain intensified and the situation was looking grim. Reynolds states that London remained the center of the free world\\'s resistance to Hitler\\'s Germany But it\\'s all in together camaraderie was disintegrating the city\\'s civil defenses were chronically undermanned as the breezy enthusiasm of those who volunteered in 1939 cracked under the incessant bombing. So how did Britain arrive at this point? Let\\'s start at the beginning Waging war on Britain was never one of Hitler\\'s grandiose ambitions he much preferred to make peace with the British even offering them the chance to keep their empire in return for aligning themselves with Germany some elements of the British government jumped at the possibility to secure a ceasefire But others namely Churchill were not so keen to do so we shall defend our island We shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds. We shall fight in the fields And in the streets we shall fight in the Hills We shall never surrender Those that shared Churchill\\'s sentiments ultimately came out on top and Hitler resolved to force Britain to pursue. Peace shattering British morale was a prerequisite since early June the German Luftwaffe had been launching reconnaissance missions over the British mainland and in July they began engaging Convoys in the English Channel in an effort to hurt British shipping on July 16th Hitler and his senior command began planning Operation sea lion with the intention of mounting a joint amphibious airborne On Britain Hitler announced that when Napoleon failed I shall succeed I shall land on the shores of Britain needless to say the plan was an ambitious one but up to that point Nazi Germany had been invincible on the battlefield the period that followed Hitler\\'s Proclamation is known as Spitfire summer a fiery clash that pitted more than 1300 German fighters against just 700 British fighters although the British Royal Air Force or RAF was almost invariably outnumbered in these skirmishes the British made effective use of Radar this allowed the RAF to keep its fighters grounded until enemy targets were spotted They could then be engaged with the benefit of foresight. As a result Luftwaffe pilots often reported that it seemed that the British were always expecting them ahead of time on the 1st of August 1940 the Luftwaffe changed their strategy up until that point the German air force had mostly focused on targeting British shipping routes and Ports in an attempt to starve Britain out now It was bent on gaining total air superiority over the RAF launching upwards of 1,000 attacks a day Later in the month. The Luftwaffe specifically honed in on RAF airfields and factories that produced aircraft parts 1270 German fighters and 520 bombers were directed to what became known as the Eagle attack but radar once again kept Britain in the fight the Industrial outskirts of London were regularly bombed But London itself was not to be touched without Hitler\\'s express approval in retaliation against the German bombing campaign the RAF Bomber Command conducted night raids that hurt German shipbuilding efforts making the prospect of a Successful German amphibious landing even less valuable than it already was Given the british royal navy\\'s control of both the english channel and the north sea. 80 british bombers were also dispatched to raid the outskirts of berlin targeting industrial and commercial targets but due to cloudiness some of the bombs fell across the city and Resulted in civilian casualties. At this point Germany was losing the air campaign to the United Kingdom the Germans did not do as much damage to British production as they Suspected even by the middle of August the British were producing double the amount of Fighters than the Germans were furthermore German fighters had limited range and could only escort bombers flying over Britain for part of their missions often this resulted in bombers being left vulnerable and shot down by British fighters. Moreover since the Luftwaffe was in enemy territory, when an aircraft was shot down an entire Trained crew was lost if a British plane was shot down on the other hand the crew could rejoin the RAF There had been reported cases of RAF pilots being downed and rejoining the battle on the same day Additionally Britain was also able to enlist the aid of experienced pilots from France, Czecho- slovakia and Poland, especially. As a consequence of these factors Hitler delivered a speech in which he denounced Britain and promised retribution to the German people When the British air force drops two or three thousand kilograms of bombs, then we will drop in one night 150 250 300 or 400 thousand kilograms when they declare that they will increase their attacks on our cities Then we will raze their cities sure enough a bloody revenge followed Saturday, September 7th 1940s was the beginning of the Blitz bombs spewed out of aircraft and fell with murderous intensity on London\\'s East End there were 430 dead as night edged in and elsewhere across London people watched with bemusement. \"Why\" they asked each other, was the Sun setting in the east as well as the West For the next 57 consecutive days raids continued day and night causing most people to take solace in Air-raid shelters British air-raid sirens became a common sound for those living London and other major cities But even those living in the countryside were not safe One of the worst incidents to have occurred during the Blitz involved the destruction of a school that was used as an air-raid shelter which resulted in 450 civilian deaths some 2,700 Luftwaffe aircrew members had been killed over 1000 had been captured and more than 1,880 German aircraft were shot down by comparison British military casualties numbered to some 500 Aircrew killed and 60 captured. Throughout the campaign The RAF was under the able leadership of the resolute and Ford looking air chief Marshal Hugh Dowding who picked his battles wisely due to the Luftwaffe numerical superiority German planes were not always engaged instead RAF planes were used sparingly to prevent Germany from gaining the air superiority It\\'s so desperately needed to defeat Britain the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe Hermann Goering is considered by most historians to have been the Inferior air commander and although many consider him to be dowdings equal and resolve Goering lacked doubting Strategic foresight and innovative mindset the Battle of Britain is generally considered a watershed moment in the Second World War culminating in Nazi Germany\\'s first major military defeat Hitler\\'s decision to put his invasion of the United Kingdom on hold and turn East to invade the Soviet Union was borne largely out of A growing need for oil to fuel the German war machine The decision gave Britain precious time to rebuild its military following allied defeat in continental Europe it also served to sway public opinion in the United States at a time when the vast majority of Americans opposed joining the struggle in Europe. We will conclude by quoting Winston Churchill who upon reflecting on the confrontation eloquently asserted that \"Never in the field of human conflict, was so much owed by so many to so few\" And now back to our sponsor who under is genuinely one of my favorite games I\\'ve actually got all of the British mid tier planes unlocked We invite all of you to join us on the battlefield for free by using the link in the description below by following this link You will gain access to your choice between a premium tank or premium aircraft and three days of premium time Once again, our link can be found in the description below I\\'d like to thank my general staff on patreon Fritz Joe Crispin.

for an exclusive offer from the team behind battleship Empire three years after the outbreak of the second sino-japanese war Japan invaded French Indochina in an effort to cut off Chinese supplies it was an easy target Germany had just finished their 46-day conquest of the French mainland shortly after Japan took another gamble and aligned itself with Germany and Italy by signing the tripartite pact it is believed by some historians that the Japanese government hoped that the US would be intimidated into loosening its antagonistic stance on Japan as a result of axis backing in the following year Japan began showing interest in the Dutch East Indies in response to Japanese aggression the u.s. announced an oil embargo and froze Japanese assets being held in the u.s. in July of 1941 the Imperial Japanese Navy predicted that they would be completely out of fuel in just two years as a direct result of the embargo at this point Japan arguably had no other option except to launch an aggressive succession of attacks on Malaya and the Dutch East Indies which would provide the oil rubber tin and iron it would need to sustain itself in a protracted conflict there was one issue the Philippines were controlled by the United States and if the invasion of British Malaya and Dutch East Indies provoked the u.s. in to waging war on Japan the Philippine Islands could not only act as a crucial staging area for an invasion of Japan but they can also block off any imports coming in to the Japanese mainland therefore planning for u.s. involvement would be required if the Japanese ever hoped to achieve their Pacific supremacy the occupation of these three major territories would also allow the formation of a fortified defense perimeter which the Japanese hope to add ward off any and

the conflict by escalating its material and moral costs beyond what the Western powers America in particular were willing pay the strategy was predicated not on American of fitness but on American rationality by 1940 the United States had formulated a plan of its own in case that war broke out in the Pacific it was called plan dog and it can be summed up with just two words Germany first the United States would focus its full attention on defeating Germany and concede the losses of the Philippines Guam and Wake Island after Europe was in allied control the United States planned to retake its holdings in the Pacific and strike Japan itself sir oku Yamamoto the Japanese marshal Admiral of the Navy during the Second World War was responsible for planning an attack on Pearl Harbor which

December 7th 1941 tasked with destroying key US air and naval targets hundreds of dive bombers torpedo bombers and fighters filled the sky despite the logistical challenges of the raid the Japanese succeeded in destroying 160 American aircraft sinking eight ships four of which were battleships damaging 10 others and killing 2335 American sailors in eyewitness Pacific Theater donald stratton one of the few soldiers who survived the explosion of the battleship arizona during the Pearl Harbor attack wrote that a fireball engulfed the whole four mast very few escaped from the bow of the ship we were pretty burned our hands our hands were just raw and in the meantime my fingernails had all come off Admiral Yamamoto hoped that the attack would accomplish two things one damaged American morale and two neutralized the US Navy's material advantage although the American fleet was temporarily incapacitated Japan had attacked Pearl Harbor when no US aircraft carriers were in port and so America was quick to recuperate from its losses still the attack did provide Japan with a window of time to occupy Singapore the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies without much resistance it's important to know that just before the attack on Pearl Harbor unbeknownst to the rest of the world President Franklin Delano Roosevelt approved the creation of the Manhattan Project the purpose of which was to explore the military uses of the recently discovered phenomenon of nuclear fission whether they knew it or not the Manhattan Project would be responsible for changing the course of world history forever as well see towards the end of our video before we get to the war a quick word from our sponsor as I've mentioned before battleship Empire recreates the most iconic naval battles of world war two from both the Pacific and Atlantic when you start battleship Empire you'll select a faction and then begin constructing a fleet at your dock yard soon you'll be ready to fight your first battle but before you enter into combat you can devise your own battle plan be sure to carefully construct your formation as numbers won't always win something I find interesting is that you can upgrade certain aspects of each ship such as the elevator of an aircraft carrier or turret of a destroyer furthermore certain tactical abilities can be upgraded on each ship and if you want an edge over in your opponent battleship Empire is offering you 100 gems 20 crude oil 50,000 gold and most notably the USS Hornet by using our promo code down below the game is completely free to download you can find the links in the description available on all mobile devices now back to the video the Malaya Singapore campaign was a resounding success for the Japanese in just two months Singapore had surrendered its fall considered one of the worst defeats in British military history the Dutch East Indies were an even easier target for Japan their only advantage being numerical strength the Dutch had not responded to heightening anti colonial sentiments in the region and could not depend on the local troops to remain loyal to their Dutch commanders in Java for example Dutch rule was deeply unpopular the Japanese quickly captured the region and gained access to the crucial oil fields of southern Sumatra in the Philippines meanwhile the situation was no better hours after the Pearl Harbor attack half of the US Army bombers at Clark Field were destroyed after a Japanese air having short-sighted lis being part wingtip to wingtip according to Victor Brooks in his book hell is upon us the enemy bombers caught much of the American air fleet on the ground during refueling the result was that by the end of the month Manoa the capital of the Philippines was occupied by the Japanese the commander of the local forces General Douglas MacArthur was forced to order a last-ditch retreat to the Bataan Peninsula in the same book Brooks writes that MacArthur now commanded a besieged army that was desperately short of food medicine and modern weapons however the Japanese overran almost every other objective in the region the battling bastards of Bataan hung grimly on and their commander emerged as America's most visible hero but by 1942 approximately six months after the start of the invasion American Filipino forces would be defeated and the largest surrender in American history 20,000 Americans and 60,000 Filipinos entered a brutal captivity from which only a minority would emerge alive four weeks later in early May the garrison on Corregidor was poured into surrender the atrocities that followed these battles include the Bataan Death March and harsh treatment of Allied prisoners corporal Hershel Williams in the book Iwo Jima recalls how prisoners he saw returned from Japanese POWs camps did not even look human I'll never forget them as long as I live they just looked like a skeleton with skin drawn over it after making a last-minute escape to Australia General MacArthur vowed to reporters that he would return to the Philippines to avenge the loss in Burma a similarly elongated campaign developed lasting from December 1941 to July 1945 throughout most of that campaign Japan clung on to its stronghold in Burma the rationale being that doing so would stop the Allied flow of equipment to China and therefore hurt the Chinese war effort soon after the fall of the Philippines in May of 1942 the Japanese attempted to solidify their dominance in the South Pacific by occupying the strategic Port Moresby on New Guinea which resulted in the Japanese fleet making contact with the Allied fleet sent to intercept culminating in the Battle of the Coral Sea the outcome of the battle is generally viewed by historians as a tactical victory for the Japanese and a strategic victory for the Allies as the Japanese sank more ships but their overall advance was halted two of Japan's fleet carriers were also rendered unfit for combat during the battle and unable to participate in the Battle of Midway one month later the Battle of Midway shattered Japanese hopes of occupying Port Moresby due to the loss of aircraft carriers that would be needed to hold on to the territory the battle also paved way for the Guadalcanal campaign which commenced in August 1942 and marked the start of Allied offensive operations in the Pacific despite having to contend with fierce Japanese resistance and tropical diseases by February 1943 the American forces were victorious in their campaign it was also around this time that the US Army Air Forces began modifying b-29 bombers to make them more compatible with early atomic bombs the American strategy after Guadalcanal was known as island hopping which as the name implies consisted of amphibious attacks on strategic islands which would provide staging areas for a future invasion on Japan this resulted in three major battles the first was the Battle of Saipan which took place in June 1944 fighting was fierce but after about a month the Japanese were trapped and rather than surrendering they either committed suicide or died in desperate Banzai charges the Japanese commander is quoted as having said there is no longer any distinction between civilians and troops it would be better for them to join in the attack with bamboo spears than be captured in what would be the largest Banzai charge of the war 4,300 Japanese charged in a 15-hour attack resulting in the complete destruction of the garrison on the island and 650 American casualties meanwhile in the Philippines General MacArthur would fulfill his promise in 1944 after the Battle of Leyte Gulf which was the largest naval battle in history one that the Japanese lost decisively and had never recovered from people of the Philippines he declared after coming ashore I have returned by the grace of Almighty God our forces stand again on Philippine soil the Japanese mounted an energetic counter-offensive but sustained 190,000 casualties before being defeated by the American Filipino forces under MacArthur the second to last major island battle Iwo Jima took place in February of 1945 and like Saipan lasted one month notably however American forces not only lost more men on Iwo Jima of that on Saipan but they actually lost more men than the Japanese who lost their entire 17,000 man garrison at the end of the battle the American flag was lifted on Mount Suribachi which previously had been used to bombard US forces the final major island battle was Okinawa which took place in April of 1945 and lasted about three months the Americans wanted the island in order to establish air bases from which to launch air raids on Japan itself Okinawa was the largest island battle of the war due to its proximity to the home islands the United States took 50,000 casualties about 20,000 of which were deaths the Japanese lost about 100,000 of their 110,000 man garrison of the island it was the largest amphibious campaign of the Pacific War and took a heavy toll on the civilian population of the island it is said that the Battle of Okinawa led the Americans to come up with an alternative to the invasion of mainland Japan because of such fierce resistance the alternative that was ultimately decided upon instead was to use strategic bombing to force Japan and mission will return to the Pacific War companion to summarize Japan's situation toward the end of the war at the start of 1945 Japan was in a difficult position her most powerful warships have been sunk her best pilots had been shot down the fortified islands that formed her first line of defense had been lost as a result her home waters were dominated by American submarines her communications with the rest of the Japanese Empire were all but cut off her cities were subject to regular aerial bombardment and her civilian population was on the verge of starvation at March 1945 the first firebomb attack on Tokyo took place by the end of the war allied air bombing killed about three hundred and thirty-three thousand Japanese and wounded four hundred and seventy-three thousand in total although estimates vary quite significantly meanwhile the atomic bomb was in its final stages of development and was given final approval for its use in late July 1945 exactly five months after the first firebomb attack on Tokyo the world's first atomic bomb was dropped on the port of Hiroshima on August 6th [Music] when the Japanese still refused to surrender a second bomb was dropped on August 9th on Nagasaki to make matters worse for the Japanese the Russians invaded Japanese occupied Manchuria that same day on August 14th a representative acting under the orders of Emperor Hirohito unconditionally surrendered and the Pacific War

Enjoy the video Soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the Allied expeditionary force you are about to embark upon the Great Crusade toward which we have striven these many months The eyes of the world are upon you June 6th 1944; perhaps one of the most iconic dates of World War two it was on this day that the Allies began their thrust into Axis territory taking the war to them and thereby commencing the liberation of Western Europe and destruction of the Nazi regime Today exactly 74 years after the day of days We recalled the Allied incursion into Normandy with harrowing details by putting you in the boots of Private Benjamin, Alvarado. Trained at Camp Fann in 1943 and shipped to England in April of 1944 on the RMS. Queen Mary Benjamin was assigned to the most gruesome of all d-day landing zones: Omaha. The following content is from his memoir. Our ship Samuel P chase was the first to move out crossing the English Channel The water was choppy. The deck was awash with vomit permeating everywhere. I stayed on the bow of the ship most of the time looking ahead. It helped me from getting seasick. We had been moving for three days which seemed a very short time, the distance about 70 miles. I was not anxious to get there. We finally stopped, all the ships were finding their positions It was very early in the morning cold dark and foggy with a little drizzle. The water was choppy. I could not see the land even though we were only 11 miles from shore. The drone of the engine stopped it was quiet. It was now 5:30 a.m when all hell broke loose all battleships began firing over 5,000 ships filled the waters planes filled the sky as far as one can see All headed in one direction, the noise indescribably deafening. Continuous firing from our ships salvo after salvo coupled with the drone of our planes bombing the beaches. Never in all the training I went through was I prepared for this. It was time to go over grab the rope net lift my leg over the side Hang on for dear life 60 pounds on my back The Rope net swung in and out as the ship and the Higgins boat struggled to me 20, 30 feet down We managed somehow to embark into the Higgins boat with the help of the men that were already there Steadying of the net the boat was full the motor started the boat shuddered away away. We went up and down the waves No land in sight go toward the noise and flashes of fire We were under the swooshing sound of our big guns Twelve and fourteen inch shells trumpeting awesomely cutting the air above us almost lifting us out of the water My heart was pounding out of my shirt as though my life were being sucked out It was horrifying our boat was zigzag trying to avoid a direct hit from enemy fire. Our officer who was standing nearest to the ramp on the right side shouted to the coxswain: \"go toward easy red easy red!\" As we approached the beach the Germans continued sprang our boat with machine gun to fire Our boat went as close as dare the ramp went down our officer jumped into the water hanging onto the ramp He extended his hand stabilizing us as we went in. I was the third one out, water up to my chest holding my m1 high pushing the water with my legs Trying to keep my balance. I was numb with fear of what I was about to encounter. It was early dawn, fog smoke covered the beach, flashes of light rumbling explosions German artillery: mortar shells bursting around us bullets whizzing by. In the waters I tripped over several dead GIS my hair stood on end I ran as fast as my legs could carry me through the smoke and gauntlet of enemy fire running erratically avoiding GIS that had fallen I ran toward a bluff that had a slight overhang where others huddled we were wet scared and trapped all in a state of shock Nothing was said we made room for each other mirroring our fear unable to encourage each other pausing for a moment to contemplate I realized the improbability of my ever going home again the invasion continued, sand and smoke sprayed upwards The beach barbed wire and landmines everywhere As our men scrambled frantically for safety a lieutenant made his way running toward us, looking as though he had just come out of a storm into our little sanctuary of protection Now we were ready to do what we trained for Our group the first and second waves of the first army were ready to move up the lieutenant warned us: \"Watch out for those landmines.\" We went through a small opening that had been made in the barbed wire when we reached the top I felt we had broken loose from the trap not looking back keeping my eyes open for any movement, I could see where the Germans had entrenched themselves and were now dead. The shooting continued as we heard to our places protection roadside ditches. The Germans were beginning to surrender as they saw us inching up towards them crying out: [In German] \"Comrade! Comrade! Benjamin made it through the Normandy gauntlet and went on to fight alongside his regimen it was thanks to his actions and those like him That the Allies succeeded in securing the beaches of Normandy from that point onward the Nazi regime\\'s days were numbered If you\\'re interested in the Normandy invasion, I recommend you check out our other video called when d-day have failed without the airborne Thanks for watching and a special. Thanks to Joshua Haverstock for researching this episode',\n",
       " \" in the d-day companion a publication written by leading historians on the subject in question it has written that from the world war ii era there is one event one memory that transcends national experiences and unites the Western Allies that event is d-day June 6 1944 the Ford of this book is written by major Richard winters who you've no doubt heard of if you're familiar with the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers today we'll be telling the story not just of winters and his men but of the other paratroopers who participated in d-day in doing so we'll be answering three primary questions first who were they airborne secondly what was their purpose on d-day and lastly would the invasion of Normandy have failed without them but first I'm pleased to announce today's sponsor patron blades more on that later throughout the Second World War Churchill had inspired his countrymen again and again with his shows of defiance and determination but even he occasionally had his doubts and on the eve of d-day he could no longer maintain his composure the following is documented in the d-day companion remember this is an invasion not the creation of a fortified beachhead with this admonition the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill concluded his address to the anglo-american High Command he was in a very weepy condition looking old and lacking a great deal of his usual vitality recalled General Allen Brooke the British director of military operations who could blame him the Allies were pursuing a bold strategy they could let Germany wither away and wait for the Soviets to make more breakthroughs where they could strike against the German war machine with a decisive blow while running the risk of being repelled ultimately they choose to enact the latter course of action a decision which despite being potentially dangerous or even disastrous made sense for one the remnants of the German Navy the Kriegsmarine which had once wrecked havoc in the Atlantic was forced to retreat to safe harbors no longer in a viable position to stop an allied from crossing the English Channel furthermore the Luftwaffe which had once enjoyed air superiority had by 1943 lost many trained pilots and had continued to use antiquated airframes he was no longer in a position to stop an insidious plan but the ver moshed entrenched in what was known as the Atlantic Wall was still a force to be reckoned with its path to the French coast would be hampered by the transportation plan however an allied bombing plan which targeted German infrastructure and effectively disabled the French railroad system by the time of the invasion it would make transporting reinforcements very difficult for the Germans so where did the Allied paratroopers fit during all of this well until d-day itself they did not play a significant role in shaping the course of the war in Jonathan mayo's book d-day minute-by-minute we learned why this is the case airborne forces are a new dimension of warfare the first parachute regiments in the world were formed only in 1936 as part of the Russian Red Army the Luftwaffe 7th Air Division soon followed its success spurred the British and Americans to follow suit thus the British 6th Airborne Division along with the American 82nd and 101st Airborne Division's were formed the hundred first and 82nd were created at about the same time with the former taking the colorful name of the Screaming Eagles division in honor of a renowned Civil War division in the latter taking the more modest name of the All American Airborne Division these divisions along with the British 6th consisted of elite trained soldiers who were paid more than infantryman and were armed to the teeth essentially these paratroopers would be tasked with dropping behind enemy lines and eliminating batteries securing roads and halting the movement of enemy reinforcements they were meant to distract and confuse the enemy providing the hard-pressed men on the beaches some relief from German artillery fire these tasks could not be accomplished by bomber planes owing to the fact that precision bombing was not sufficiently developed making boots on the ground an absolute necessity on June 5th a few hours before the day of days the paratrooper is prepared to prove their abilities in combat the parachutist got dressed for action a few hours ago they have to be helped into their planes as they can barely walk due to all of the equipment they carried some have shaved their heads to make it easier for wounds to be treated by medics some have shaved their heads just to look like Mohicans faces are black with soot or boot polish they want to look invisible and as intimidating as possible and speaking of Shaving today's video is sponsored by patron

don malarkey who served alongside Richard winters tells us that easy companies flight was largely uneventful but when crossing france's Cherbourg Peninsula all hell broke loose big guns thumped below searchlights rolled around the cloud searching for the likes of us tracer bullets from anti-aircraft and shoot unsynched through what was now darkness fires burned on the grounds from planes that had already been shot down all I was thinking was get the hell out of this plane malarkey then the light turned green and stayed green I yelled and jumped into the Normandy night what followed was for the most part chaos the experiences of Jim Wallwork and Oliver Boland pilots of the British six Airborne Division reflects the tumult of the situation both were ordered to make crash landings upon impact wall work and his navigator were flung through the cockpit window still in their seats everyone else in the plane was knocked unconscious but Boland was still very much wait after the plane he had been flying landed and broke in half he told his stuntmen we're here do what you're paid to do only a few short seconds before a third plane crash behind him but even though everything did not go according to plan to say the least they're British six Airborne Division carried out all of its objectives and secured the east flank of Normandy by capturing Pegasus bridge which crossed the Conn canal the six provided Allied forces with valuable time to land over Sword Beach with ingenuity initiative and determination the 6th Airborne Division had secured the Allied left flank at a cost of 821 dead two thousand seven hundred and nine wounded and 927 missing about evenly divided the dead and prisoners the American divisions meanwhile tasked with securing the west flank were hindered by the indecisive command of generals Bradley Ridgeway and Taylor we turned to the d-day companion once more to sum up the result the American Airborne Division Behind Utah Beach by the 82nd and 101st Airborne Division's remains second only to Omaha Beach landing in near disaster never have so many dropped in so small an area with so little purpose so much loss only the fighting heart of younger officers and sturdy troops saved the operation Richard winters and his memoir titled beyond band of brothers recalls the following from his landing armed with the knife that I had stuck in my boot I struck out in the general direction where I thought my leg bag had landed just as I started off trench knife in hand another paratrooper landed close by I helped him cut free from his chute then grabbed one of his grenades and said let's go search for my equipment although the 82nd and 101st Airborne Division's failed to take Carentan and time and did not stop the German 6th parachute regiment from launching a counter-attack the Germans were disoriented by their landing and repelled in some locations from strategic choke points the hundred and first was able to encircle six artillery batteries of the German 709th division and kept the infantry of that division distracted until the beaches were stormed in recognition of these efforts the body of historians whose work we referred to earlier wrote that no one quibbles about the fortitude and tactical skill of the three allied airborne divisions that participated in operation Neptune thus we can conclude that although in all likelihood d-day would have succeeded without the use of paratroopers due to Germany's Vantage in the air and at sea the Allies would have sustained significantly more casualties and their progress would have been slowed thanks for watching I'd like to thank my general staff on patreon Derek Bello Jake Hart PJ nave Eric Greenwood Joe Crispin gibbsy Fritz Patrick Reardon James Thompson

new series on historical guns later this month in the book the Leningrad blockade it is written that among the Soviet population somewhere between 1.6 and 2 million perished within the city of Leningrad and in battles surrounding the region between 1941 and 1944 the lowest range of this estimate exceeds the total number of Americans both military personnel and civilians who have perished in all armed conflicts from 1776 through the current war in Afghanistan I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian and today we'll be discussing the 872 day long siege of leningrad which is widely

the tracking link to this game in the description below and you can expect more information at the end of this video 500,000 men of the German Army Group North dated by 1500 tanks the German air force advanced rapidly towards the Soviet city of Leningrad the former capital of the Russian Empire the citizens of Leningrad are on edge in July 1941 and stromae valet diva a Russian artist writes the following I suffer from constant mental and physical fatigue I cannot stop thinking for one minute about our courageous warriors a month after Anna wrote her entry the nearby cities of Novgorod and shunova fell to the Germans nothing stood in the way of Leningrad the first official acknowledgement of German troop movements read as follows comrades Leningrad errs dear friends over our beloved native City hangs the immediate threats of attack by German fascist troops the enemy is trying to break through to Leningrad he wants to destroy our homes to seize our factories and plants to deranged our streets and squares with the blood of the innocent to outraged our peaceful people to enslave the three sons of our motherland but this shall not be Leningrad cradle of the proletarian revolution never has fallen and never shall fall into enemy hands in early September 1941 German artillery began shelling the city Soviet General George uh qov arrived just days after the start of the bombardment and transformed Leningrad into a fortress hundreds of thousands of civilians were drafted to build a series of Defense's that stretch from luga and other outlying towns to the outskirts of Leningrad men and women of all ages worked rapidly to make up for their lost time however the internal defense of the soviet union had not been thoroughly considered by stalin and so preparation for the engagement with the verre moshed was largely unorganized after weeks of fortifying the Soviets anticipated a frontal assault on the city headed by German General Vilhelm von Leeb but it never came a large portion of the German forces were diverted last-minute to assist in securing southern Russia and those German troops remaining around Leningrad waited for further orders before initiating their main assault the upper echelon of Germany meanwhile were planning something utterly malevolent genocide and ethnic cleansing on a scale unprecedented Hitler knew that Germany could not feed the enormous population of Leningrad and so he resolved to let the population wither away due to malnutrition in the unforgiving Russian winter any survivors would likely meet a similar end as some historians speculate that hit wanted to have the city razed to the ground so wide Leningrad given that Moscow as well as the oil fields Germany would so desperately require in the coming months both why South will again quote the Leningrad blockade to explain Hitler's desire for Leningrad went beyond its military and industrial power to him the city symbolized the intrusion of Slav them onto the Baltic Sea coast that former Germanic domain of the Teutonic Knights and the Hansa in the cradle of revolutionary communism by late September of 1941 the city was almost entirely encircled and most of the civilians were trapped the siege had begun according to Anna Reed's Leningrad the epic siege of world war ii failing to empty leningrad of its surplus population before the siege ring closed was one of the soviet regime's and worst blunders of the war leading to more civilian deaths than any other except the failure to anticipate Barbarossa itself by August 29 636 thousand two hundred and eighty three people according to official sources had been evacuated but just over two and a half million civilians were left behind in the city plus another three hundred and forty three thousand in the surrounding towns and villages over four hundred thousand of them were children and over seven hundred thousand others were non-working dependents in late June nearly two months before the full encirclement of the city the local government of Leningrad did attempt to evacuate four hundred thousand children but this measure was reviled among Leningrad's populace sure enough the children that were evacuated approximately 15,000 in total ended up being put in the path of the ver Mach 2 as the German forces broke through the luga line during the initial stages of the siege Lou Bava Silvia recounts the following the skies were white balls of explosion the desperate efforts of the anti-aircraft guns suddenly from behind the roofs of a cloud started to grow it was so unlike small is it for a long time I could not comprehend that it was fire it wasn't long before a gnawing hunger seven a ration card system had already been put in place before the siege began but once it was under way the rations issued to Leningrad errs were three times smaller it certainly didn't help that the loaves of bread were largely composed of sawdust due to the scarcity of flour it actly one month later the first instance of cannibalism in Leningrad was recorded efforts were made to resupply the defenders through Lake Ladoga which froze over and allowed for an ice road to become operational this was the lifeline of Leningrad up to four hundred trucks a day delivered supplies across the ice taking refugees back after every trip but driving over the thin ice wasn't the only thing to worry about harsh conditions were compounded by the German Luftwaffe making the act of traversing the road a very dangerous one many who tried would end up at the bottom of Lake Ladoga the situation only continued to deteriorate in the following year with death rates spiking in the winter of 1942 during this period close to 200,000 people died began corpses a common sight for those brave enough to venture out into the once lively streets of Leningrad Yelena maitreya wrote in her diary which is now preserved in the Museum of Defense in Leningrad that this has reached an immense harvest on Linea Graz frozen streets silence and assigned to be seen not a rustle to be heard not the sound of cars our steps magnificent silence Lidia Rossum off SCA's account has also gained recognition in Russia as a former nurse she relays how near the end of January a boy appeared at the hospital she was working at and according to Rosa masuka's account he was skinny pale and indifferent to everything the boy went on to say that his parents were fighting in the front lines and his grandmother who was taking care of him passed away in many ways the boy's story was a microcosm for the desperation that all leningraders faced during the summer of 1942 almost a year after the beginning of the siege this anafi non offensive was launched which proved inconclusive it was followed by Operation oscura in the winter of 1943 which was carried out by the combined Leningrad and volkov fronts and culminated in the triumph of the Red Army after they repelled the Germans who were manning fortifications on the southern banks of Lake Ladoga this allowed the Soviets to ship more supplies to the hunger stricken populace but it would take more than a year for the siege to be completely lifted by the time the German siege was fully lifted in 1944 about one and a half million soldiers and civilians had perished we'll conclude by quoting Anna Reed who in the conclusion of her book says this after even the

The island nation had developed a highly militaristic Society and this was intensified after the Emperor of Japan Consolidated his power in what was known as the Meiji Restoration With its populations adherence to warrior and feudal codes translating into a religious devotion to the Emperor these years of seclusion Contributed to the development of a xenophobic mentality the Japanese viewed their culture as the most sophisticated and civilised this sense of national pride continue to inflate despite increased influence of the West in matters of technology and trade throughout the 19th and 20th centuries the combination of Ultra-nationalism a centralized state and European technology allowed Japan in the first sino-japanese war To conquer Korea from the Chinese whose administrative process and technology paled in comparison The Japanese would continue to expand throughout the Pacific and on to the East Asian mainland The requirements of both a large population and a large military began to strain the Japanese economy Causing ever deeper expansion into the Asian mainland in September of 1931 Japan invaded Manchuria which offered ample resources and living space as Justification Japan cited the Mukden incident in which elements of the Imperial Japanese Army Detonated a small amount of dynamite at a section of the South Manchuria railway Which had been granted to them in the russo-japanese war the Japanese then falsely accused China of sabotage Despite receiving orders to keep the incident contained at a local level the Japanese army Proceeded to capture all of the cities along the South Manchuria railway and surprisingly the Republic of China maintained a policy of non-resistance Although some Chinese warlords and generals tried to resist but unsuccessfully by February of 1932 Japan had control over all of Manchuria establishing the puppet state of Manchukuo Which interestingly was governed by the last emperor of China the 26 year-old Pu Yi The Chinese appealed to the League of Nations in response and after a year-long investigation The league concluded that the invasion was unjustified to which Japan simply left the League of Nations Chiang kai-shek was aware that the Japanese interests in China were not over and so in 1936 He agreed to an alliance with the Communists putting the Chinese Civil War on hold Less than one year later the second sino-japanese war would break out in full when on the 7th of July Japanese troops conducted a Military exercise near the Marco Polo Bridge in wham pink which startled the Chinese garrison who weren't warned in advance And the resulting confusion shots were exchanged and after the skirmish ended the Japanese noticed one of their men was missing after a headcount When the Chinese refused to allow them to search the city the Japanese attacked the city head-on trying to cross the bridge on July 20th Japan began bombarding ran ping and by the end of the month had taken Beijing and the surrounding areas the Japanese were initially content with the territory they'd taken in northern China and wanted to end the war quickly But Chiang kai-shek was not giving up anytime he decided to open up a second front at the city of Shanghai storming the Japanese quarter of the city on the 13th of August The fighting around the Shanghai area lasted for a total of three months marked by intense close quarters combat Shanghai finally fell when an afib ia's Japanese force landed in the southern region of the city Which was left undefended the Chinese took heavy casualties Losing two hundred and fifty thousand men many of them their highest-quality troops while the Japanese lost 60,000 on the 8th of November Chiang ordered his forces to retreat west towards the city of Nanking the capital of China at the time The Chinese in Nanking were positioned in elaborate fortifications inside and outside of the city Despite these defenses the Japanese had captured the southern portion of the city by December 12th Which prompted Chiang to evacuate his troops from the city the Japanese were frustrated after what they thought would be an easy victory this frustration Translated into brutality against the civilians who were raped and executed on an immense scale estimates for the number of casualties ranges from 50,000 to 300,000 the massacre is possibly the defining event in the second sino-japanese war and is possibly one of the single largest atrocities in human history as such the event remains one of the primary reasons why even today Relations between Japan and China are at best somewhat bitter by 1939 the war was beginning to reach a stalemate the Chinese still refused to surrender despite huge casualties and Territorial losses and had begun to receive much-needed experience and foreign aid meanwhile The Japanese lines of communication were being stretched to their limit and Japanese forces had suffered substantial losses both equipment and manpower however Japanese spirits were lifted when their German Ally signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union whom the Japanese feared would invade Manchuria and their holdings in northern China on September 14 13 days after Germany invaded Poland a Japanese force of 100,000 men attacked the city of Shanghai which was the next major target on the road to Shan Shan where the Chinese government had been relocated a force of 240 thousand Chinese soldiers repelled them Inflicting more casualties than they had sustained on October 6 the Japanese myth drew and allowed the Chinese three lost ground in the surrounding areas Shengshou was the first major Chinese city that managed to fight off the Japanese successfully while the Kuomintang tended to partake in large sweeping Operations their communist allies in the north had mainly opposed the Japanese through insurgency and guerrilla tactics But under pressure from Chiang kai-shek the Communist Party of China began to execute large offensive actions on the 20th of August 1940 the CCP gathered 400,000 men of the 8th route army and assaulted numerous staging areas and railways which were defended by 420 Japanese and collaborationist to Chinese forces and what would be called the hundred regiments offensive? although the Japanese and collaborators push in the back the communists considered their campaign successful because it resulted in the destruction of about 600 miles of railroad tracks The remainder of the second sino-japanese war was marked by repeated failed attempts by the Japanese to take various strategic studies It wasn't until near the end of the Second World War when on the 9th of August 1945 three days after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima The Soviet Union declared war on Japan and promptly destroyed the primary Japanese Army in Manchuria on the 15th of August Japan surrendered ending the second sino-japanese war and Ending the occupation of China within a year the Chinese Civil War

The average lifespan of a soldier in Stalingrad was just 24 hours. The battle for the city that bore Stalin\\'s name was one of the longest and most arduous of the Second World War. It is for that reason that most historians regard the battle as a turning point in the war. I\\'m Griffin Johnson, the Armchair Historian, and today, in addition to telling you about the battle itself, I\\'ll be providing the personal accounts of both Russian and German soldiers in an effort to tell you the story of Stalingrad. But first, today\\'s video is sponsored by Skillshare. I know; it\\'s like we\\'re official now!

The Wehrmacht is just miles away from the Russian capital but is halted due to extreme weather conditions. The German infantry is plagued with frostbite while the tanks are running short on fuel, not that it matters because their engines won\\'t even start; it\\'s -4 deg F (-20 deg C). Meanwhile, in Moscow, a secret meeting is taking place, headed by Stalin himself, who refuses to leave the city and proclaims that \"Moscow will be defended to the last.\" At this meeting the top Soviet military brass is gathered to discuss the Red Army\\'s next course of action. Amid an atmosphere of panic and uncertainty, Semyon Timoshenko, the People\\'s Commissar of Defense, takes the podium. Timoshenko boldly proclaims: Hitler acknowledged the scarcity of oil himself, reportedly saying: Thus the decision was made by Hitler and his senior staff to divert the German Army Group South to secure both the Volga and the Caucasus. The plan would be called Case Blue (Fall Blau) and was meant to be a second blitzkrieg to break the stalemate of the Eastern Front. It called for the assembling of 1,300,000 men and 1,500 aircraft. The men that made up Army Group South were split into two detachments: Army Group A, which would swing around the city of Stalingrad, secure the oil fields at Baku, and then converge on Stalingrad from the south; and Army Group B, which was made up of the German 6th Army, the 4th Panzer Army, and their Romanian and Italian allies, would march directly towards Stalingrad, the major Soviet industrial city. The Soviets had other plans. The oil fields of Maikop and Elista, which were on the way to Baku, were both set aflame by the Red Army. Grozny, meanwhile, also enroute to Baku, was destroyed by the German Air Force, or Luftwaffe, instead of being captured, due to the fierce Russian resistance and strained German supply lines. This meant that Army Group B would be taking on Stalingrad alone and would face severe logistical problems. Hitler\\'s oil crisis persisted, but the Battle for Stalingrad was only just beginning. The German Army Group B, spearheaded by the 6th Army under General Paulus, met resistance from the Soviets near the Don River. It took nearly a month for the 6th Army to assert control over the area that lay west of Stalingrad. The campaign was already shaping up to be slightly more costly for the Germans than expected. However,\\nmorale among the troops remained high as they waited for a victory and dreamt of either returning home or settling in Russian lands after the war ended. Wilhelm Hoffmann, a soldier at the time of the battle, wrote in his diary the following: If you haven\\'t already, I suggest taking a look at my video which goes through the majority of Wilhelm\\'s diary in Stalingrad. With the German advance delayed, Soviet military officials in Stalingrad, headed by Chuikov, had time to prepare for the desperate onslaught that was materializing. As Catherine Merridale relates it in her book: Citizens of Stalingrad would be forced to stay and face the battle ahead. There would be no retreat. The first direct attack on Stalingrad began on August 23rd. 600 planes of the Luftwaffe flew over the city and relentlessly carpet-bombed its inhabitants. The German planes left decimation in their wake: 40,000 Russians, mainly civilians, were killed, and much of the city was reduced to rubble. Max Hastings, in his book describes the aftermath with haunting detail: The Soviet forces took up positions in the central and northern parts of Stalingrad. As the German 6th Army encircled the city, a Russian soldier named Anton Dragan documented what life was like for him as a lieutenant of the Red Army: Every inch of the city was disputed as the Germans were forced to make their way through the city house by house, stairwell by stairwell. The Russians were told to practically hug the German advance to render German aircraft and artillery support useless. The Luftwaffe maintained air superiority and continued carpet-bombing, killing Russians and Germans alike and preventing boats from bringing shipments of supplies to alleviate the defenders. It is in the midst of this scene of chaos that we return to Dragan, who describes the dire state of the Soviets\\' position: During this retreat to the inner city, the Soviets were aided by artillery that was tactically positioned on the Volga\\'s eastern bank. The growing feeling of frustration on the German side is aptly captured by Hoffmann\\'s entry on 22 September 1942: And on the Soviet side, Chuikov, the commander of the 62nd Army, who maintained rigid discipline, shed light on a more desperate state of affairs: Chuikov writes on another occasion: \"Everyone saw a man in flames leap out of his trench, run right up to a German tank, and smash a bottle against the grille of the engine hatch. A second later, an enormous sheet of flame and smoke engulfed both the tank and the hero who had destroyed it. Acts like this prompted the Germans to express disbelief, even in the air. A Luftwaffe pilot who had rained fire from the skies said: As the infamous Russian winter set in, the tide of battle turned. The Russians put Operation Uranus into action, planned by the Chief of the General Staff, Georgy Zhukov, and executed by a Polish-Soviet officer, Konstantin Rokossovsky. Their goal was to encircle the 6th Army and relieve Stalingrad\\'s determined defenders. The operation began on 19 November 1942 and involved more than a million Red Army soldiers. Only three days after the operation had begun, the 6th Army was completely encircled and trapped in the city that they had besieged. Hitler did not consider retreat an option, and he gave orders for the Germans to hold their ground. The Soviets also gained air superiority by producing large numbers of aircraft and positioning anti-aircraft guns that prevented the Luftwaffe from being able to airdrop supplies and evacuate men. One of the more notable Soviet aircraft Was the Il-2, a ground attacker which would pick up the nickname \"Flying Tank.\" If you\\'re interested in learning more about this aircraft, check out the video by my friend Tiberiu over on the YouTube channel Wartime History. This put an end to any hope of Axis victory. Now it was only a matter of time before the Soviets overwhelmed the German forces. Under General Paulus, the 6th Army and its allies held out until January before finally giving in. Although Paulus did not agree with Hitler\\'s orders and considered defying them, he did not attempt to break out, largely for fear of leaving other elements of the Wehrmacht in the clutches of the Red Army. When the Soviets finally overran the Germans and drove them out of their dugouts, It seemed to some that the battle had been \"the same nightmare for everyone.\" However: Although many historians attribute the German failure at Stalingrad solely to poor logistics and planning, the Soviets\\' unwavering defense of the city was also a crucial factor in determining the outcome of the battle which would shape the rest of the war. In accordance with order #227, made famous for its line, \"not one step back,\" the Red Army had withstood the German onslaught. From that point on, the Soviets would remain on a near-constant offensive, pushing the Germans back to Berlin by 1945. Now back to our sponsor, Skillshare.

       " \" [Music] on March 17th 1861 Italy after centuries of invasion and internal strife was finally united under one king but why was it this period in particular that gave rise to the creation of a unified Italian state when other European powers such as Britain France and Russia had been well established centuries prior I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian and today we'll be discussing the topic of Italian unification but first today's video is sponsored by total battle total battle is a free online strategy game that we'll be taking a look at towards the end of this video there unique tracking link can be found in the description below and now let's take a look at the state of Italy before unification to help us do this James from the YouTube channel Sweeney will be joining us hi Grif like the ancient Greeks Italians have historically identified with the respective city-states as opposed to a distinct Italian nationality these city-states were often governed by foreign powers but by the dawn of the Renaissance a number of independent regional States emerged these budding principalities were eager to advance their own interests and regularly waged war with one another in times of invasion they sometimes align themselves not with their Italian counterparts but with the invaders allowing Italy to become a playground for the armies of Spain France and the Holy Roman Empire during the 15th and 16th centuries in history of nations Italy terrico Hoffa asserts that Italy must be the most invaded country in the world and Lombardi one of the world's greatest battlefields thanks James if you guys haven't already please check out the channel Sweeney you can find the link in the description below he actually created an entire video series on the broad history of Italy you should definitely check that out now back to the video the 16th and 17th centuries marked a rebirth of culture and mercantilism in northern Italy the national consciousness began to develop due to figures such as Dante Alighieri niccolò machiavelli and Cesare Borgia who were all considered the forefathers in some way shape or form of a united Italy their influence would sputter and die out however as the Renaissance drew to a close and Italy became overshadowed by the colonial powers of Europe as the glory and splendor of Florence and Venice faded the cities of the Atlantic seaboard sir asked them in wealth and status what followed from the 1700s to the early 1800s is referred to by some historians as The Forgotten centuries with Napoleon's invasion of Italy abruptly shattered this period of relative calm in the words of Kohath er Napoleonic armies brought with them the germs of liberalism fostered by the French Revolution of 1789 and introduced a minor Industrial Revolution sufficient at least to provide some of the war equipment required when the plains Empire collapsed the masses celebrated his defeat having been agitated by conscription and heavy taxes they hoped for a return to the status quo along with the lacs rule of a Duke or Pope but Napoleon's mark had been made many of the individuals that would go on to spearhead the Italian nationalist movement were descended from the people who profited financially and politically under French jurisdiction nationalist sentiments had been stoked in this exclusive Italian social class and secret societies began cropping up all across the nation so what was the political landscape like after Napoleon's final exile well between 1815 and 1848 Naples continued to be subjected to bourbon wool and Tuscany Milan and Venice were controlled by the Austrians during this period some of the Italians began to realize that the type of centralized government they had been administered by under Napoleon could improve quality of life and to protect their fiscal interests to a greater degree than the Habsburg or bourbon governments did as the Industrial Revolution swept across Europe an expanding Italian middle class saw value in roads railways and an increasingly interconnected network of markets before we begin explaining how the war broke out let's introduce some of the figures that shaped the course of the so-called research amento and embedded themselves in Italian history the first is Giuseppe Mazzini who was one of the earliest revolutionary spokesmen he produced revolutionary writings abroad after being banished from Genoa and Piedmont Mazzini was of the staunch conviction that the matter of Italian unification was a divine duty ordained by God himself he also stressed Italian self-realization without the intervention of foreign powers his ultimate vision was that of a utopian Italian Republic that respected the rights of the everyman at one point he was considered the de facto leader of the Italian revolutionary movement but this position would be usurped by Camilo been so the count of cavora shrewd and some would say Machiavellian politician Tavor ended up orchestrating most of the political maneuvering that led to the eventual italian unification by 1861 the year of cavorts death the only Italian territory is not united under him and his leash victor emmanuel ii where the city of rome itself and austrian controlled venice the final character will be elaborating on is giuseppe garibaldi a gruff and honest man and an accomplished guerrilla leader whose tactical prowess made him an incredibly useful asset to the italian struggle for independence against the Austrians Garibaldi was known for his frugality preferring to sleep on a straw bed and wash his own clothes even when staying in palaces he had a general disinterest for politics and holding office and although he paraded around as a Republican he became supportive of the idea of a dictatorship to force liberty on the people of Italy all three of these figures distrusted and intensely disliked one another but each succeeded in advancing the cause of Italian unification much like Alighieri Machiavelli and Borja once did in 1848 revolution in France once more spilled over in the Italian peninsula this led to the subjugated people's of Milan and Venice to take up arms against their Austrian rulers the Neapolitans meanwhile we're an open revolt against the Bourbon regime that ruled their country in recognition of this turbulent state of affairs Charles Albert the king of piedmont-sardinia declared war on Austria which marked the official start of the first Italian war of independence however the Neapolitans early withdrawal coupled with the disagreements with the Milanese and Piedmontese led to an Austrian victory and Charles Albert was forced to abdicate to a victor emmanuel ii the Piedmontese were also forced to pay sixty five million francs in reparation to Austria but piedmont was not deterred a second Italian war for independence broke out in 1859 when piedmont-sardinia managed to secure a secret defensive pact with France because the pact was purely defensive Keva were the prime minister of piedmont-sardinia at the time resolved to provoke the Austrians into fighting he accomplished this by stationing troops close to the border prompting the Habsburg government to issue an ultimatum that was rejected the war had begun but not long after France entered into secret negotiations with Austria fearing the possibility of Prussian involvement an armed assist would be signed which effectively granted Sardinia Piedmont the state of Lombardy but in short Austria would gain control over the central states of Italy much to Manuel's dismay this latter term was never enforced however and the French made no attempt to expel the Italian Garrison's that then assumed control over the region since the outbreak of the war in return for French backing Cavour ceded nice and Savoy to France this decision enraged the Italians preeminent general during the conflict Giuseppe Garibaldi Garibaldi promptly launched an expedition against Sicily in an act of borderline mutiny which resulted in its annexation in his name meanwhile cavour secured the incorporation of the Duchess of Parma Modena the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the papal States with the exception of Rome Cavour apid expansion forced Garibaldi to cede his control of Naples and Sicily to emmanuel ii after the Piedmontese army marched south through their newly acquired territories six years later following the conclusion of the third and final war of Italian independence which was part of the austro-prussian war Venice was seized from the Austrians and the provinces of Italy were unified under one government but the papal state was still guarded by Napoleon the third after Napoleon lost to the Prussians during the franco-prussian war however France withdrew from Rome in the capture of Rome in 1870 ensued fully uniting Italy after unification the newly created state of Italy faced a number of roadblocks that stood in the way of progress for one the majority of the middle class and aristocracy alike had never truly been won over by the revolutionary ideals that trickled down from France in addition the Italian parliament experienced gridlock as socialists and liberals failed to compromise on even the most basic pieces of legislation to conclude will cite Serge Hughes a professor at Hunter College he describes how in the 1870s the cry of resort amento leaders was now that we have made Italy we must make italians but decades passed and Italians were still as disunited as ever these issues would continue to plague Italy throughout the nineteenth century and even today as I mentioned before today's video is sponsored by total battle this game allows you to build up a sprawling city training massive army and join a clan to take part

       " \" [Music] in the middle of the fifth century the Roman Empire was crumbling nearly all of northern Italy had fallen to the Huns and in the south not even the eternal city of Rome was safe it was in the wake of this apocalypse that Venice was born I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian coming to you in an actual armchair and today we'll be discussing how Venice was able to establish itself as a trade empire that retained a Republican system of government for much of its existence but first I'm pleased to announce that today's video is sponsored by Bank Note world an online

a specific tracking link in the description below you should definitely check them out now on to the video in the year 452 the Huns began their invasion of the Italian peninsula the northern Adriatic coast would become a refuge from many Italian lenders fleeing Attila due to the absence of fertile soil these refugees learned to live off the sea and eventually entire communities of fishermen and salt miners dotted the coastline these lagoon dwellers all agreed to band together for mutual protection against the Huns Goths and later Lombards approximately 300 years after atilla's death when the political situation in Italy had calmed the Venetians convened and chose a leader or so epitome or so and many of his successors would align themselves with Byzantium the eastern remnants of the Roman Empire in order to obtain protection against the ever encroaching lombards however when the lombards were conquered by the franks nearly fifty years later some Venetians began to consider seeking protection from Charlemagne instead these overtures fell short however and Charlemagne son Pepin launched an invasion of Venice prompting the nations to relocate to the Rialto Islands in Thomas F Madden's book Venice a new history he describes how the Venetians employed every defence against the Franks that their watery fortress could offer their actions alone made it impossible for Pepin's forces to penetrate the interior of the lagoon Pepin would withdraw from his invasion after his men started dying from disease dodging an yellow party soup at CEO came to power a year later and ordered the construction of a new capital for the region of Rialto Venice's good fortune continued when the Franks and the Byzantines signed an agreement in 814 that recognized Venetian independence Venice was now looked upon as a promising link between the East and the West over time a Venetian identity began to form and in 1032 Doge a Dominico flibben echo had drained the Venetian swamp so to speak and popular elections were restored I'll be it limited to an exclusive assortment of Rialto Nobles during this time the relationship between Venice and the Byzantine Empire became increasingly cordial as Venice reinforced Byzantium naval defenses and Sicilian Holdings in return Venice's merchants were exempt from customs dues and a commercial Quarter was established in Constantinople allowing them to trade grain and wine from Italy salt from venice's inland territory and wood and slaves from Dalmatia in exchange for silks and spices that the Byzantines had access to in the Near East Venice's rapid rise in these years can be directly attributed to the spice trade as Venetian trade ambitions expanded relations between the increasingly arrogant Venetian merchants and the Byzantines slowly decayed these tensions reached a tipping point during the Fourth Crusade when Venice under the nearly blind 96 year old Doge a and recode Angelo took part in the sacking of the Byzantine capital Constantinople in Kahlan Thorens book the Venetians he writes the conquest of 1204 had far-reaching and enduring consequences for Venice Dandolo had won some important concessions and had acquired for the Republic the entire western coastline of Greece plus the port of Gallipoli and the wealthy Thracian City of Adrianople not to mention the Venetians got their hand on untold amounts of ancient relics and riches from plundering Constantinople during the rest of the 13th century Venice eclipsed its genoa and peas and rivals by cementing its supremacy in the spice trade and securing a trade agreement with the man luke's who had recaptured their holdings lost to the Crusades the year 1453 marked the rise of yet another Islamic empire and the Venetians saw their opportunity to further capitalize in the region they secured trading rights with the Ottoman Empire the same civilization that dealt Venice's former benefactor it's an tiem it's killing blow however this relationship would deteriorate just as it did with the Byzantines causing the Ottomans to cut off venice's access to the Black Sea and upon taking over Egypt in 1517 sultan selim the first further alienated venice by imposing restrictions on venetian trade in alexandria leading to a significant reduction in spice imports to the island state from that point on the ottomans usurped venice's role as the leader of the spice trade forcing venice to look for an alternative enterprise luckily in 1492 Spain triumphed over Granada and opened up the West Mediterranean to the Atlantic this would prompt Venice to further cultivate trade connections with northern european principalities under the holy roman empire especially with flanders being deprived of spiced imports more Venetian merchants also devoted their efforts to training with Germany acquiring metal products that they would trade throughout the Mediterranean world by the 16th century Venice reached its peak in both population and per capita income but by the 17th century Dutch merchants benefiting from the new world markets became more influential than there was a Venice and European trade now that we've addressed the overview of the history of Venice up until the 17th century let's determine what aspects of Venice's unique government and society allowed it to assert control over the Mediterranean trade to begin with Venice was Republic in a feudal world dominated by noble and royal dynasties although Venice did spread its influence through some territorial expansion most Venetians devoted their efforts to competing for new markets and trade agreements as opposed to militarist to conquest many DOJ's especially during venice's early history tried to establish their own ruling dynasties but the individualistic spirit of the Venetian masses persisted there for the DOJ's powers were severely checked by an assembly of Nobles that consisted of Venice's wealthiest merchant elite partly as a result of these policies Venice built up an impressive Navy to safeguard and propagate its interests the Venetian Arsenal a public shipyard constructed in 1104 provided thousands of the nations with jobs and migrant workers were also contracted no other medieval state had nearly as many trading connections as Venice did although most were involved in the Arsenal where spice trade some Venetians found work as silk makers and glass blowers earning gentle acclaim for their lavish and decorative products Mo's a assists and wood carvers also plied their trade internationally by decorating the interiors of cathedrals and palaces throughout Europe in the realm of banking Venice introduced a government-controlled bond to market in the 1200 s and in the 1500s Venice began to sell tax-free bonds on the open market in a way the Renaissance had started much earlier for Venice as its people perpetually saw themselves as the forefather of ancient Rome like ancient Rome they certainly left

compared to the great powers of europe were marginal at best but this did not stop the newly formed kingdom from taking a series of economic and military actions in order to earn its place among them i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian and today i'll be answering two questions first why was italy so hesitant to join the great war given the country's aspirations to improve its international standing and second why did italy join the antan despite making promises to defend germany and austria-hungary let's start at the beginning following the costly wars of italian unification italy was led by victor emmanuel iii and the liberal giovanni jolidi who intermittently served as prime minister from 1892 to 1921. gilletti's tenure gave rise to an era of economic growth and industrial expansion from 1900 to 1914 however during the early 20th century many still considered italy to be inferior to its neighbors in particular france and germany who boasted vast and thriving economies despite its insignificance to many european countries italy was not outcasted during the dawn of the 20th century it had become part of the triple alliance in 1882 with the two other signatories being the austro-hungarian empire and german empire the italians had entered into the alliance to gain protection from the french who had tarnished italy's past colonial ambitions the stipulations ensured italian neutrality in the case of a russo-austrian war and mutual protection in the case of a franco-german war having consolidated its position in europe italy turned its attention towards africa italy had already established colonies in somalia and eritrea and now sought to link these territories this led to the outbreak of the italo-ethiopian war in 1895. the italians markedly underestimated the capabilities of their african foes while overestimating their own leading to a humiliating defeat italian officials promptly set their eyes on libya deeming it a more promising colonial venture the italian government had maintained a long-standing claim on libyan territories since as early as 1877. thus italy's press had no problem beginning a centralized push for war against libya in the spring of 1911. depicting it as a land of vast resources which was well watered rich in minerals and only guarded by a poultry force of some 4 000 ottoman troops who probably would not receive substantial reinforcements due to the ottoman empire's ailing state meanwhile giovanni gilletti entered into diplomatic proceedings regarding the libyan situation with other european powers garnering tacit approval for military action ottoman emissaries replied to italy's posturing with a proposal that would nominally maintain libya's tributary status under the ottoman empire but hand over control to italy on a practical basis joliti refused the offer and declared war on the 29th of september 1911. italy was largely unprepared when the war began but it fielded up to a hundred thousand troops during the conflict facing a less than equal force of arabs and turks italy also enjoyed an advantage at sea overcoming its initial setbacks by overwhelming the ottoman fleet stationed on the libyan coast however with the initial stages concluded the war slowly morphed into a stalemate with constant small-scale fighting continuing throughout northern libya trench warfare became common and in the later stages of the war airships were used as a last-ditch effort to bomb ottoman troops out of their entrenched positions this marked the first point in human history that any sort of bombing occurred from airships the conflict was also notable for several types of armored vehicles that were experimented with in libya regardless of certain italian ingenuity the so-called military cake walk had turned into a year-long affair and finally ended with the treaty of auchi on the 18th of october 1912. for all of its efforts italy acquired libya the war also took a massive toll on the italian economy and its careful spending policies went out the window due to the costly expenses associated with funding the war instead of the projected monthly bill of 30 million lire 80 million lire had to be diverted each month to fund the war in addition the italians sustained around 7 000 casualties making the endeavor an altogether costly campaign during the years building up to world war one italy had carefully maintained friendly relations with the british and french even signing a secret pact with the latter in 1902 this shift in geopolitical alignment was due in part to italy's long-standing feud with the austro-hungarian empire over the adriatic islands and some other mainland territories in europe when it became clear that italy would not be granted possession of any of these italian territories italy was forced to look elsewhere for nations to validate her claim by 1914 italy had still been recuperating militarily and economically so when war broke out italian prime minister solandra stated that italy would not commit troops on the ground that the primary purpose of the triple alliance had been defensive and austria was acting as the aggressor in the war during the early period of the war the triple alliance attempted to keep italy from remaining neutral by promising territories such as trentino and the austrian literal but trieste and south tyrol were not offered due to this impasse the minister of foreign affairs sydney sonino took the initiative and brokered a deal with the antart they promised italy all of the territories it had coveted for so long south tyrol the literal dalmatia and other adriatic islands that the triple alliance had refused to give up the treaty became known as the treaty of london on the 26th of april 1915 and virtually nullified the triple alliance the central powers were completely unaware of italy's official realignment on the 3rd of may 1915 the italians publicly withdrew from the triple alliance and in the ensuing days italy's parliament now headed again by former prime minister giovanni dralidi fought to stop entry into the war but while liberals resented the idea nationalists celebrated it so pro-war proponents sprang up all across the nation to voice their support for an italian declaration of war their called arms were answered on the 23rd of may when italy officially declared war on the austro-hungarian empire entering into the first world war to conclude italy's indecisiveness during the outbreak of the first world war was largely a result of a number of foreign policy blunders during the 19th century the italian government learned from its mistakes and in a response to a weakened national spirit and economy did not jump into the fray without first calculating all of the options it was presented with despite italy's alignment with germany and austria-hungary in the last century siding with the ontant proved to be a safer and more viable course of action which may very well have saved italy from continuing on its downward spiral after the treaty of versailles had been signed in 1919 italy gained control of trentino trieste tyrol and istria and found itself in a much more stable position however it came at a profound human cost and gave way to the rise of extremist and nationalistic elements in the country thank you for watching i'd like to thank my general staff on

       " \" the russo-japanese war was the first contemporary conflict in which an Asian country successfully stood against a European power though I hesitate to make the claim that Russia was defeated it is clear that the nation became internally fractured Japan on the other hand would confirm itself as a global power but would still face economic tribulations as a result of their military campaign but we're not here to discuss the political or diplomatic impact of the russo-japanese war nor are we here to discuss why it even happened rather we're here to talk about how a Western superpower was brought down to its knees by an up-and-coming oriental Empire so to answer this question let's first examine each nation's military prior to the war starting with leadership Russian leadership during the russo-japanese war was somewhat poor the two primary naval commanders deployed by Russia were Admiral William Fitz jeff'd and Vice Admiral zenovia tossus ven Suki aged Admiral had his own distinct flaws it's jeff to the commander of the 1st Pacific Fleet wasn't a bad commander necessarily but he was extremely indecisive this would lead to some inconclusive actions on his end and before he could really make a difference in the war he was killed in the Battle of the Yellow Sea this left Russia with just one able naval commander process Fenske the commander of the second Pacific Fleet he was resented by his own men as implied by his nickname mad dog we can see exactly how mad he was by his action in the dogger Bay incident where he opened fire on British ships in the North Sea because he thought they were working with Japan this almost started a war with Britain and ended up costing him access through the Suez Canal when trying to reach Japan on land it wasn't much better Russia had two main commanders the first was Alexei Kota Potkin a timid and defensive commander who lost both major battles of the russo-japanese war Buckton and Leo yang the second was Major General Anatoly Cecil this man was the complete opposite of quota Potkin he was stubborn and combative this is shown by his refusal to leave Port Arthur even after being ordered on multiple occasions to relocate he would end up leading an unsuccessful defense of the port city both at sea and land Japan had more success with their commanders their main naval commander Togo Heihachiro was a man considered to be the Horatio Nelson of Japan he was a naval expert not only because of the experience he gained at war but also because of the modern naval school and he received in England on land we have no gay modeski another man considered to be a hero in Japanese history he was the quintessential Samurai this would lead to some very brave actions on this part would also result in higher casualties for his men because of his antiquated style of leadership we can see this in the siege of Port Arthur lastly we have a Yama eeww another samurai general who would win the most significant battles of the russo-japanese war he well learned a considerable amount of military strategy from his experience in fighting and observing in major Wars around the world including the franco-prussian war so overall we can see that Russia was at a disadvantage when it came to leadership now on to drill and tactics let's start with Russia after their defeat in the Crimean War in 1856 against Britain France and the Ottomans major military reforms were put in place but they proved somewhat ineffective certain logistical improvements were made such as the implementation of the levy system which hastened mobilization and furthermore compulsory military service was reduced to help improve the economy but the effect was counterintuitive by no longer requiring so many years of military service peasants had more time to educate themselves and learn trades which in turn led them to realize how backward Russia really was this alone acted as a crucial element to the mutinies that took place during and after the war as part of the reforms enacted Russia's army budget was nearly halved from 30% to 18% by 1902 and so by 1904 when the war began Russia was spending around half of what other major powers were spending on each soldier predictably Russian soldiers performed poorly the Russian military was still teaching volley fire which demanded that all soldiers wait to reload and fire simultaneously that only was this highly ineffective but as General Sir Ian Hamilton a British spectator of the war put it as far as the instruction in marksmanship is concerned a soldier might as well just fire blank cartridge if he does not know where his bullet is struck or what faults he is committed in elevation or Direction the Russian infantry shop oddly and the Japanese infantry shot excellently and quote now let's take a look at Japan Japan had originally operated under a Shogun we're both warfare and politics were limited to the blade but after 1853 when American ships forced the end of an isolationist policy Japan began rapidly modernizing obviously traditionalists weren't too happy about this especially when their influence began to weaken by 1868 the Beauchene war ignited under Emperor Meiji against the Shogunate and concluded with the defeat of the pro Shogun rebels thus modern Japan was formed with that came the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy which is developed with assistance from advisors for France and Germany these advisers began heavily remodeling the Japanese command structure furthermore the enactment of conscription in 1873 saw the size of the Japanese army increased dramatically in that year their army numbered around 18,000 men but just two years later it nearly doubled to around 33,000 men this trend would continue all the way up to the russo-japanese war despite their best attempts however Japan's resources GDP and manpower were still dwarfed by Russia's but as we'll soon see the conflict was very much a war of logistics and while Japan focused very little on supply Russia could not transport their men fast enough to reach Manchuria on top of this Japan fought very aggressively in Russia fought very defensively and so Japan perfectly utilized Russia's absence in the Manchurian region with that said we can conclude that Russia was also at a disadvantage when it came to drill and tactics now let's talk about technology of each combatant the Russians were mainly equipped with the most Nagant rifle the most account was an effective and robust bolt-action rifle so much so that variations continued to be produced today on the Japanese side was the arasaka type 30 rifle which at that time was superior in most regards to the most Nagant but not so much so as to greatly influence the outcome of the war also featured in the conflict was the early usage of machine guns the Russians were equipped with the powerful Maxim machine gun which outclassed the Japanese Hotchkiss machine gun just like with the rifles however the machine guns were similar enough as to not make a decisive difference Russia and Japan were evenly matched in terms of ground weaponry and at sea things were similar as well both sides were using modern battleships but the way they are being utilized greatly differed as previously mentioned Japanese naval commander Togo Heihachiro took great inspiration from British naval drill and therefore used his ships in a much more efficient manner now let's dive into Russia's logistical problem probably the most widely agreed cause of the Russian defeat was there in capability to effectively cross Siberia and confront the Japanese Russia mainly relied off of intimidation tactics to preserve their precarious holdings East Russia did have a large garrison in their eastern territories after fighting the Boxer Rebellion that most of these men were ill-prepared and under-equipped the main purpose of the garrison wasn't so much as a shock force as it was a show of force to the Japanese as Russia wanted to expand their influence into Korea and Manchuria their empty threats however wouldn't work for long the Japanese were quick to see through their facade of military might so lastly we can infer that Russia was at a disadvantage when it came to technology now you're probably thinking wow this channel is really biased towards Japan but let's conclude this video by taking a look at the battles of the war to which you can be the judge February 8th 1904 Japanese destroyers launched a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur to start the war the attack is inconclusive April 30th the Battle of Yalu River the Russians lead a failed offensive May 24th the Battle of Nanshan an overwhelming Japanese force faces off against Anatoly Steele in which he manages to inflict heavy casualties on the Japanese force but fails to hold his ground losing the battle January 14th the Battle of telli sue the Japanese inflict thousands of casualties on two Russian forces only losing several hundred the Japanese win the siege of Port Arthur July 30th 1904 to January 2nd 1905 steel leads an unsuccessful fortification against Matt escape both sides sustained heavy losses but Japan's victorious August 10th the 1904 the Battle of the yellow scene heihachiro faces off against Vitz jeff'd in an inconclusive engagement August 25th the Battle of VO yang Aoyama eeww outnumbered two to one takes on Alexi quota Potkin the Japanese win again unhappy with the results the to meet again from the 5th to the 17th of October in the Battle of shahu the Russians take double the casualties and lose the battle to make matters worse a revolution is thrown in Russia on the 22nd of January forcing reinforcements to return west and deal with the unrest February 20th to the 10th of March Yama eeeww takes on Alexi quota Potkin for the final time around 600,000 troops take to the field in one of the largest battles in history the Russian forces suffer defeat and officially withdraw from Manchuria the land war is lost but rasa Sven Suki still believes he can win the war at sea he confronts the Japanese Navy in the Battle of Tsushima against Togo Heihachiro on May 27th 1905 rastas Fenske is heavily outnumbered and outgunned the battle is extremely decisive the Japanese suffer around a hundred dead the Russians over 4,000 with most of their Navy gone with Teddy Roosevelt as arbiter a peace was made in the Treaty of Portsmouth on September 5th 1905 thank you for watching I'd like to thank my general staff on patreon Jim Talbott Dimitri

       " \" when I want to understand the cause or the impact of a war in history it can be very tempting for me to read a basic synopsis of the conflict and believe that I understand the general idea but oftentimes these summaries are limited or at worst misleading this is especially true of the franco-prussian war which was produced by years of contention and complex diplomatic intrigue so to understand it we first need to illustrate the geopolitical situation in Europe at the time its 1852 in France and in an attempt to reanimate the French Empire president employing the third names himself the new emperor of France this act blatantly signals the French reentry into active power projection fast forward a year later in 1853 and France's new emperor is already provoking Russia in the Crimean War and even though France would claim victory the war still proved rather inconclusive but it did help bring France back onto the international stage regardless of this Napoleon the third was still eager for a more prestigious and powerful France switch over to Prussia in 1866 under king of elam the first as he finishes the seven weeks war against Austria this work concluded with the formation of the North German Confederation and the end of Austria's influence in the German region with half of Germany now unified under Prussia's banner and southern Germany without Austria's protection Prussia sees a clear opportunity to expand her borders south but there's one looming threat standing in her way as can be inferred the prospect of a unified German state to oppose France was not taken well by the French people and government we can see the growing tension by the late 1860's between the two competitors both sides knew that war was inevitable France needed to stop Prussia from expanding and Prussia sought to unite Germany but neither side wanted to start the war against each other out of fear of intervention by powers such as Britain and Russia so for now both sides would remain quiet as tensions did increase one event would prompt the two nations to take action against one another in June of 1870 revolutionaries in Spain now stood their Queen Isabella the second the country was then without a legitimate ruler and a letter was sent by the Spanish military Hunta to the Prussian Prince Leopold offering him the crown King Vilhelm was hesitant to endorse Leopold but Otto von Bismarck recognized the potential to gain an ally on the Iberian Peninsula Bismarck eventually convinced Leopold in secret to accept the invitation on to the Spanish throne but Napoleon learned of it soon enough he was in full protest and demanded that Vilhelm objective Leopold's coronation bill helm did so in order to prevent a premature war but Napoleon the third pushed it further he sent a diplomat Count Vincent Benedetti to speak with Phil from the first the French diplomat demanded that the Spanish throne should not be meddled with by the Germans in complete perpetuity but Vilhelm refused what would then be dubbed the m's dispatch was sent to Bismarck from Ville home outlining the meeting between the French diplomat and himself Otto von Bismarck found himself in the perfect position to justify a war with France without the possibility of international repercussions Bismarck published the m's dispatch in the press but manipulated it to make both the diplomat and the king come off as insulting towards one another this inflamed public opinion in France so much so that on the 15th of July the French parliament approved of mobilization in preparation for war against Prussia in reaction oppression and Bavarian armies mobilized a day later by the 19th of July France officially declared war and hostilities commenced as Bismarck force all no other nations decided to intervene in the war general mobilization in France would end at around 900,000 men as the war progressed and the Germans would mobilised 900,000 on top of their already 500 thousand strong army by late July and pulling the third officially assumed command of the French forces at Metz numbering around 200,000 men in early August and employing the third took the offensive but would soon withdraw before the Germans could arrive after realizing the scale of their mobilization which was faster and more efficient than that of the French furthermore the German army was logistically superior to the French army mainly through Prussia's more competent usage of railroads this allowed the Germans to deploy far quicker by mid August a series of battles would take place all over France and the Germans would be constantly on the offensive the most pivotal battle took place a month later at Sudan on the 1st of September where 200,000 soldiers confronted 130,000 French soldiers who were attempting to relieve the siege a mess with the Adept leadership of Field Marshal helmet Fung the Russians encircled the French and wrote their lines ultimately resulting in the surrender of Napoleon the third and his entire army marking the end of the second French Empire in the beginning of the third French Republic with the capture of the main French army the Germans proceeded to Paris just a day later subjecting him to a nightmarish 130 days siege which the new republican government tried to break several times without any success with Paris starving the French government initiated peace talks on the 24th of January 5 days after Campbell was proclaimed emperor of Germany out of which they obtained a ceasefire agreement after intense negotiations in the Treaty of Frankfurt the Germans successfully proposed a treaty in which they were given the german-speaking region of Alsace Lorraine and made France recognize the German Empire on top of this France was obliged to pay five billion francs to cover the costs of German occupation as Napoleon the third had abdicated the papal states were absorbed into the Kingdom of Italy meaning both Germany and Italy were officially unified the integration of Alsace Lorraine by the Germans from the French would lead to even more friction between the two powers which contributed to the causes of World War one in which the French would reacquire the region in this war the Germans suffered approximately 45,000 dead and 90,000 wounded the French suffered around 140,000 dead and 140,000 wounded in almost 500,000 captured at a glance the franco-prussian war was started by France over a letter this is the most apparent reason for the conflict however it is just as important to look at everything behind the scenes from multiple perspectives by understanding all of the background information one could make the case that Prussia was the true aggressor this is a clear example in history of fabrication and public manipulation to justify an entire war to that point it's fairly obvious that the war wasn't just about insults and national pride but rather about the long-term geopolitical entanglements of the German and French interests for this reason a thorough study of any historical event is imperative to see past the extensible if you want to know how the North German Confederation and their allies won the war so quickly be sure to check out our follow-up video on the battles of the franco-prussian war thank you for watching I'd like to thank my patrons on patreon Emerson Emmanuel Adamski

       " \" [Music] the Crimean War was one of the most deadly conflicts in late European history its impact was subtle but span from improving military technology and medicine to indirectly leading to the end of the Ottoman Empire it was the largest European war after the Napoleonic Wars and would remain that way until World War one so the fact that this war so briefly mentioned in general history books is astounding for this reason I'd like to discuss the informational side of this war as later I will be creating a video essay on the effects of the war the Crimean War was fought by Russia against the United Kingdom France the Ottomans and Sardinia Piedmont it's commonly believed that the war had been started on the grounds of religious disagreements over Christian shrines in the Ottoman controlled Palestine region but many believed this simply to be an excuse for Russia to exercise power in the Balkans and seize Constantinople to regions also belonging to the Ottoman Empire at this time Russia had protection rights and all of the Christian shrines in Ottoman lands but because France had recently claimed the title of protector of the Catholic faith they aim to change this the religious contention started when the new president of France Napoleon the third threatened to seize the churches and place them under Catholic rule Napoleon the third yearned to gain prestige for his newly declared two second French Empire and wanted to improve relations with the Catholic Church so to assert his power in the poem the third would send ships to the Black Sea between Russia and the Ottomans since Orthodox rites were now under threat nicholas of russia sent an ultimatum to the ottomans in May of 1853 and demanded that all Orthodox land under the ottomans be placed under his protection directly because of the growing tension Britain tried to mediate the discord but was unable to find any compromise between the three nations when the ottomans refused to accept Russia's ultimatum Nicholas of Russia invaded the Orthodox Romania and Moldavia in July of 1853 there was little response at first as the Ottomans and French were unsure what to do it's important to know that Russia made this audacious move because they expected support from Austria Britain and even some of the other major European powers but they were mistaken the Ottomans were dubbed the sick man of Europe their economy in shambles and increasing autonomy within the Ottoman subjects led to extreme domestic instability and so Russia's impression of this was that Britain and Austria would want to take advantage of the weak into Turkish state and seize new land but because Britain wanted to maintain the balance of power in Europe as set in the Congress of Vienna in 1815 the British would join the side of the French and many other countries would simply remain neutral Britain figured that Russia gaining monopoly in the Black Sea would hurt Britain more even if they could take land from the Ottomans the British and French knew that the main objective of the Russians at the time was to gain control of Constantinople after all the Russians saw themselves as the new Byzantine Empire and wanted to control the birthplace of Orthodox Christianity but back to the conflict the Turks were hesitant at Russia's aggression but soon declared war on Russia in October of 1853 just three months after the Russians entered the Balkans the Turkish army crossed the Danube met the Russian army head-on and defeated them in the Battle of all tanita compensating for their defeat however the Russians destroyed a huge Turkish fleet at Sonoma lately memory this naval battle is no more as it was the first battle to future shell guns highly effective explosive shot naval cannons after this naval defeat the British and French fleets hurried to blockade the Russians in the Black Sea arriving in early January 1854 in late March 1854 the British and French would officially declare war after much pressuring from the Ottomans that same month the Russians crossed the Danube again and invaded Turkish Bulgaria Austria however protested at Russia's expansion and so in August of 1854 they forced the Russians to withdraw this is really important as Austria's main and really only Ally was Russia so by losing her only real Ally Austria would remain helpless until the turn of the century before I talk about the major offensive that broke out in Crimea it is important to know that this war was not exclusive to the small Peninsula of Crimea the war was also fought in the Black Sea Baltic Sea the caucuses and the Balkans but for the sake of this video we're going to just be focusing on the Balkans and Crimea now it's time for Britain and France to finally act they decided that landing in Crimea would be perfect as it would allow them to threaten Russia's Black Sea trade eliminate the Russian fleet and lay siege to major Russian cities while still maintaining logistical efficiency through their proximity to the Ottomans through the Balkans and before I even talk about Crimea it's also important to know that leadership on both sides of the Crimean War was really abysmal this is explicitly shown in the beginning of the allied campaign so as the Allies would set sail under Lord Raglan for the British and the seriously ill marshal Armand de Sol are known for the French these leaders didn't even really know where to land until they finally reached Crimea and when they did they chose to land at a beach an open Beach not a port and this was about 30 miles north from Sevastopol the landing took an entire five days and this showed a lack of ability from the Russian commander Alexander Menshikov as he did not take this very clear opportunity to completely wipe out the Allied forces and only now with the Allies fully equipped did Prince Menshikov attempt to stop the Allies at the Battle of Alma in mid-september of 1854 this attempt to hold the Russian line at the river Alma cost menshikov five thousand seven hundred of his original 36 thousand four hundred men and only cost the Allies about half of that around three thousand of their original 52 thousand as menshikov received word of Russian reinforcements he pulled back to fortify Sevastopol the Allies chased Menshikov and would finally reached the city by late September 1854 the French and British are now ready or at least believe they're ready to lay siege to Sevastopol to see the continuation of their campaign please watch part 2 thank you and I'll see you next time\",\n",
       " \" hey guys welcome back to armchair history today we will be introducing a new show called tank ranks where we'll be taking a look at tanks throughout history and ranking them based on effective speed firepower armor reliability and reusability this week we'll be talking about the Crusader the infamous desert tank designed to win through superior maneuverability overall firepower or armor the Crusader were otherwise Cruiser mark 6 tank was Britain's most important tank in world war two of the North African campaign firstly on classification it's important to know this tank was a cruiser tank meaning it was used for speed and was lightly armoured mainly used for reconnaissance and quick forward assaults this would prove great for desert condition the other main classification you're going to see later on is the infantry tank which is used to support the infantry in the main attacks it'll be much slower and much more armoured with in most cases higher firing so why was the Crusader or Cruiser mark 6 created well after the realisation that the previous Cruiser mark 5 Covenanter tank could not cope with the speeder armor required for the standard British Cruiser Nuffield mechanizations an arrow Unlimited decided to come up with a brand new model in 1939 this model was to be one of the fastest of its day this was due to a genius idea by American J Walter Christie by using an aircraft engine therefore the Crusader tank would officially adopt the Nuffield Liberty v12 water-cooled 340 horsepower engine this along with large and spread out wheels allowed for the Crusader to reach speeds of around 27 miles per hour with 43 km/h on road and 15 miles per hour or 24 km/h cross country and up to 40 miles per hours or 64 km/h with increased horsepower which at the time was faster than any other tank on the field for its day it would be first modeled with an ordnance qf pounder 40 millimeter gun in the mark 1 crusader this however would prove inadequate along with its just 40 millimeter main armor so long with the increase in the armor for the mark ii crusader it also got an upgrade to the 49 millimeter gun and the final mark 3 crusader would receive an ordnance qf 6-pounder 57-millimeter main gun any deduction to only three to four crew members as well as fifty-one millimeter main armor allowing it to put up a good fight with any mid generation Panzer 3 or Panzer 4 tanks and fitting well with the British doctrine of firing accurately and quickly all on the move so this leads to the next question where and when was this tank operating by 1941 Crusaders received its baptism of fire in North Africa after the axis pushed the Commonwealth forces all the way back to the Egyptian border in June of 1941 the reinforcing Crusader tanks refilled the entire six Royal Tank Regiment which attached to the second Royal Tank Regiment forming the well-known 7th Armoured Brigade Desert Rats the brigade first saw action in operation battle ax attempting to relieve forces defending in the siege of Tobruk the Crusader tank played a crucial role in the Battle of El Alamein the siege of Tobruk and all throughout Tunisia these tanks have been easily taken out by axis anti-tank guns however which could easily ignite the unprotected emigrants anti-tank guns would be the main reason the Crusader had been taken out of action in battle rather than to enemy tanks and more surprisingly these tanks had been lost to more mechanical failure than to actual enemy fire problems occured by the cooling system and air filter so the engine was often restored from 340 horsepower to 400 horsepower by the soldiers themselves which could then reach up to 40 miles per hour or 64 km/h which once again was the fastest tank of the time these tanks would soon be outclassed though by the closing of the North Africa campaign but still the Crusaders remained the most important British tank in the Africa campaign after which in 1943 they began being replaced by US vehicles including the Stewart & Sherman tanks as their armor and inability to take a gun any bigger than a 6 pounder meant they rapidly became obsolete regardless special versions could be seen throughout the duration of the war such as the following Crusader 3a a mark 1 2 3 anti-aircraft Crusader AVR mark 1 armoured recovery vehicle overall including all variations around 5,300 Crusaders have been produced and saw great effectiveness and used throughout the North Africa campaign lastly any specifications on this tank can be seen through this the Crusader tank had some great firepower for its day but it failed to be able to keep up with other tanks giving the firepower rating of three out of five the Crusader was also known for its speed and throughout its use in Africa was the fastest tank on the field giving it a five out of five its armor had a lot of flaws compared to other tanks in the field but for a cruiser tank it had much better armor than any other cruiser before it giving it a two out of five one of the biggest flaws of the Crusader was its reliability as it even lost more tanks due to mechanical problems than combat giving it a 2 out of 5 lastly the Crusader was favored by the British Army and played a vital role in all of the major battles of North Africa and later was used throughout the rest of the war in its variations such as the Crusader anti-aircraft or Crusader gun tractor giving its overall use a four out of five this tank falls short and reliability and certain armor design flaws however overall when it got working it got the job done and for the time period it was deployed and saw further use through many of its variations giving the overall rank for this tank a 16 out of 25 thanks for listening I hope you'll join us in the next short film for armchair history\",\n",

territories like the West Bank raising tensions due to Israeli settlement expansions and a growing sense of Oppression among Palestinians these elements coupled with with Israel's economic and political isolation of Gaza have also been Central to the escalating hostilities amid Rising violence and political shifts in Israel a significant majority of Palestinians in the West Bank expressed support for armed resistance against Israeli occupation a 2023 poll conducted by the Palestinian Center for policy and Survey research revealed that 72% of pal iians endorsed groups like The Lion's Den and jenin Brigade known for their hard stance against the occupation this sentiment was fueled by Israel's increasingly hawkish policies and ongoing military actions in Palestinian territories which were perceived as dismissive of the two-state solution and precipitated frequent violence over the course of 2023 Palestinian grievances reached a critical point with escalating settler violence numerous administrative detentions and a sharp rise in Palestinian casualties fueling growing tensions as Hamas bolstered its fighting force warnings from the US and Egypt about its activities went unheeded by Israeli intelligence including mosad they underestimated Hamas dismissing detailed plans for a large-scale assault and an invasion invol involving drones and paragliders as beyond their capabilities concerns raised by the Israeli signals intelligence unit about hamas's preparations were ignored reflecting a belief that Hamas was contained and seeking to avoid fullscale war however that was not the case on October 7th around 6:30 a.m. Hamas commenced their Full Assault on Israel codenamed operation l oxa flood this offensive began with a widespread rocket barrage targeting key Israeli military and civilian locations simultaneously over 3,000 militants infiltrated the Israeli barrier using aerial drones to scout over and disable Israeli observation posts while Fighters used paragliders speedboats and Motor Vehicles to bypass security perimeters the capture of check points and breaching of Border fences allowed access for larger vehicles to pass through as Palestinian militants rapidly gained ground following the breach of Border checkpoints and fences the Hamas militants initiated an amphibious Landing in zikim where Israeli sources reported that 10 civilians were murdered at the beach with another nine gunned down in a nearby shelter the Israeli Defense Force responded by killing killing two attackers on the beach and destroying four vessels including two rubber boats nearby Hamas militants also captured a military base near nahal AZ leading to the deaths of at least two Israeli soldiers and the capture of six others intense fighting also ensued at the ree military base where Hamas temporarily seized control of the base and took several Israeli soldiers captive although the IDF later regained control Additionally the police station in stot fell under Hamas control with militants killing 30 Israelis including policemen and civilians Hamas targeted rural Israeli communities causing widespread destruction and civilian massacres multiple hostages were also taken from populated towns near the Gaza border a music festival near re faced an especially brutal attack with mass casualties and more hostages allegations of sexual violence against Israeli women supported by Israeli forensic evidence were also made Hamas and the Palestinian Authority disputed the mass casualties blaming them on Israeli strikes but Israeli police contended that their aerial response caused only a minor portion of the casualties primarily from Friendly Fire Israel's military response was initially slow with helicopters from the north facing difficulty distinguishing militants from civilians in the chaos Pilots initially bombarded targets indiscriminately attacking around 300 sites in Just 4 hours gradually Target selection became more cautious the confusion was worsened by militants employing tactics to blend in with civilians specifically they deliberately avoided running or making sudden movements to mimic typical civilian behaviors during Air Raids this tactic made it challenging for Israeli forces to distinguish them from local civilians in the area by 9:00 a.m. amidst growing disarray some helicopters engaged targets without prior clearance in a televised appearance prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel was at War and threatened to turn all the places where Hamas is organized and hiding into cities of ruins the IDF launched operation swords of iron signaling a fullscale military response Israeli forces mobilized extensively and a state of emergency was declared significantly restricting civilian movement in areas close to Gaza the idf's measures included a total blockade of Gaza cutting off electricity and Essentials leading to wide spread criticism from human rights groups allegations of using white phosphorus Munitions by Israel were reported by Human Rights Watch and verified by Amnesty International but denied by Israeli authorities by October 13th the IDF issued urgent evacuation warnings for Northern Gaza giving Palestinians just a day to relocate South faced with a harrowing decision many Palestinians remained in place as Hamas defying the IDF urged them to stay amidst a storm of international criticism of Israel's tactics the IDF made a controversial accusation they claimed Hamas was using civilians as human shields in response counter claims from the media emerged alleging that Israel had struck civilians along designated safe routes into Southern Gaza Israel disputed these counter claims maintaining their stance on the situation on the 17th of October tragedy unfolded in southern Gaza as Israeli air strikes while targeting Hamas once again wrought havoc on civilian areas over 70 lives were lost including those of families who had fled from northern Gaza seeking safety among them was Aman noal a senior figure in hamas's military wing while a victory for the Israelis further District leading to intense clashes with hamas's elkam brigades and the Democratic front's National resistance brigades these groups employed anti-tank missiles and heavy artillery against IDF vehicles with Israeli casualties giving impetus for further resistance from Palestinian militants Beyond engagements with the elkam brigades the idf's extensive use of air strikes was directed against the jabalia refugee camp on October 31st causing dozens of fatalities and injuries eyewitness reports described catastrophic scenes with the numerous casualties predominantly being women and children this attack in particular led to International outcry and several countries severing diplomatic ties with Israel the first group of evacuees including the critical wounded and foreign Nationals began leaving Gaza for each Egypt on November 1st a total of 500 evacuees were to be moved over several days with 200 already at the border meanwhile the jabalia refugee camp endured a second devastating bombing prompting the UN Human Rights office to express concerns about the potential War crime implications of such attacks 2 Days Later an ambulance Convoy was hit in an air strike killing 15 and injuring 60 the IDF claimed that the ambulances were being used by Hamas a claim that the Palestinian red crescent society and Hamas officials strongly denied strikes against a civilian school and Hospital claimed more lives on November 4th turkey condemning Israel's actions and their refusal to accept a ceasefire recalled its Ambassador meanwhile Palestinian militants continued to harass Vass Israeli units in pitched Urban battles claiming 24 Vehicles up to that point further strikes against hospitals led the Human Rights Watch to call for a weapons embargo on both Israel and Hamas this fell on deaf ears as the us pledged to supply Israel with $320 Million worth of precision guided bombs on November 13th the IDF began a number of operations aimed at clearing out underground tunnel networks and headquarters located beneath the city of Gaza in one of these raids the IDF claimed to have discovered a suspected Hamas holding area for Israeli hostages beneath the AL rentis hospital they also claimed to have found a calendar titled operation Al AXA flood linked to the 7th October Massacre but the interpretation of this calendar was contentious and widely debated reports of Civilian casualties were leaked after a raid on alifa hospital with the IDF claiming that they were there for humanitarian assistance Netanyahu also cited hostages as a reason for the IDF entering the hospital conflicting reports emerged about the IDF providing Aid at elifa where they claimed to have discovered weapons indicating a Hamas Command Center however recent investigations by The Washington Post found no such evidence of any Command Center evacuation notices in southern Gaza and a fuel induced Telecom blackout escalated concerns by November 20th IDF assaults against the Indonesia Hospital in Gaza Drew International criticism mostly due to the fact that a significant number of civilians and medical staff were still inside during the attack after a month of brutal fighting and mounting pressure throughout November a ceasefire agreement was finally reached on the 22nd between Israel and Hamas this included hostage releases and a temporary pause in hostilities facilitated by Egypt and Qatar the ceasefire aimed to seed a broader peace agreement unfortunately the brief Gaza truce collapsed on December 1st with Israel and the US blaming Hamas for the breakdown Israel resumed hos hostilities with air strikes especially in the southern city of K yunes and enforced evacuation procedures Hamas suspended hostage negotiations demanding a halt to attacks and the release of Palestinian prisoners for the IDF alleged discoveries of concealed weapons and militant equipment found throughout areas of Southern Gaza gave them further impetus to press their campaign the US called for renewed hostage negotiations and civilian protection but Amnesty International raised War crime concerns due to us-made weapons used in air strikes lacking military targets Fierce fighting and bombing in Gaza has intensified in the north with the IDF claiming to have uncovered another large weapons cache located adjacent to the lamal health clinic and Bay Leia school over December Israel shifted its military campaign to the more densely populated South this Focus not only complicated Israeli operations but greatly increased the risk of Civilian and Military casualties the IDF reorienting toward ground operations over air strikes issued evacuation warnings to Palestinians in K yunes before commencing military operations the US continued to support Israel's stance against Hamas though there have been increasing disagreements between the us and Israel regarding the escalation of military actions the West also urged the establishment of humanitarian corridors to assist the 2.3 million people in Gaza highlighting the critical need to minimize civilian harm the offensive marked a fraught second stage in Israel's military campaign 400,000 displaced gazin moved South becoming cornered in a region racked by intense Urban combat K Yunis a power base for the Hamas leadership in Gaza also underwent heavy fighting internationally the UN stressed the importance of safeguarding civilians and facilitating humanitarian Aid as accusations of genocide continued to grow though the US said likewise they vetoed resolution drafts by the UN Security Council stalling attempts to address the Palestinian crisis head on meanwhile a Hamas delegation was dispatched to Cairo on December 24th discussing a potential ceasefire plan with Egypt as 2024 unfolds the world watches with baited breath hoping for a peaceful resolution to a conflict that continues to take a heavy toll on lives and stability in the region\",\n",
       " \" it is November of 1864 William Tumo Sherman restless and Vigilant watches as the railroad Depot illuminates what little is left of the Atlanta Skyline after a costly siege for the city had been one in September Sherman was gathering all the supplies he could to move onward to Savannah splitting Georgia and thereby the Confederacy in two to Aid in this the Union Army had to vacate Atlanta stripping it of any military worth for Atlanta's people it was a devastating loss for Sherman it was just the beginning as the American Civil War entered its fourth year the Union's High command was becoming increasingly desperate to end the conflict a grinding stalemate between generals Ulus srant and Robert E Lee in Virginia made prolonging the war unpopular and the November elections loomed on the horizon amid this backdrop the Atlanta Campaign of Brigadier General William tumpa Sherman would take place culminating in the Battle of Jonesboro where Confederate Railway supply lines to Atlanta were cut leading to Confederate Lieutenant General John Bell Hood evacuating the city and destroying rail cars full of ammunition in his Trail the union occupation of Atlanta began on September 2nd just 2 months before the presidential election providing Abra Abraham Lincoln a much needed win the newly promoted Major General Sherman set up his headquarters in the city and the few remaining civilians were ordered to evacuate hoping to divert Union attention away from Georgia the scattered Confederates coalesced around Hood to harass supply lines leading to Atlanta and wreak havoc in Tennessee after multiple false starts in pursuing The Runaway hood and contention with his superiors on what to do next Sherman sent a communication to Lincoln and Grant detailing his plans and requesting permission to proceed stating I propose we break up the road from Chatanooga and strike out with wagons for milleville Millan and Savannah until we can repopulate Georgia it is useless to occupy but utter destruction of its roads houses and people will their military resources I can make the March and make Georgia howl after much deliberation on November 2nd Grant simply

reelection Union Soldiers started tearing up Atlanta's Rail lines by the 15th Sherman's Army prepared to make its fateful 225m March to the coastal city of Savannah but first he ordered all of Atlanta's Industrial and Commercial capacity destroyed sparing only these Ci's churches and private homes despite this many residential areas were caught up in the fires by the time his army departed on the morning of the 16th nearly 40% of the City was destroyed with the major generals Henry slokum at his left flank and Oliver Howard at his right Sherman marched Southeast toward mon Sherman's Army comprising 62,000 men was predominantly infantry alongside this there was a 5,000 strong Cavalry Division and 2,000 artillery men equipped with 64 guns having obliterated their only Supply Route these soldiers were now reliant on the resources of the Georgia Countryside for sustenance throughout the entire 225m March foraging units were dispatched to Villages along their route to gather as much food as they could with specific instructions to avoid burglarizing civilian homes they were directed to focus on acquiring supplies from wealthier residents in reality these foragers saw nothing more than free real estate in addition to the seizing of livestock meat and Grains Union foragers ransacked homes for valuables clothing jewelry wigs anything that could be sold or shown off was Milford some Southern families opted to bury their possessions often for their slaves to lead soldiers to them Confederate defenses against Union pillagers were meager at best led by Lieutenant General William Hardy a Garrison of a few thousand militia at mon gathered to meet Howard's Union forces only to see their movements turn and head east of the Town it was a faint and Hardy caught on quickly that Sherman was making his Target ambiguous Beyond this ragtag Force at mon there were also roving gangs of Cavalry led by Major General Joseph wheeler these units were most effective at catching forgers in the act and distributed summary executions to any captured Yankees as Howard continued his faint around mon one of his accompanying Cavalry regiments was ambushed by wheelers and then lured into a trap as they gave Chase three brigades of the Georgia militia were making their way through Griswald Ville just a couple miles east of mon where Wheeler's Cavalry would leave their Union pursuers to deal with while this Skirmish did distract parts of Howard's column Superior Federal numbers quickly overwhelmed The Defenders causing the Georgia militia to suffer disproportionate casualties as the mounted forgers passed by the Richer parts of Northern Georgia they took the initiative not only to ruin Plantation property but to free the slaves who worked on such property to the average Southern Aristocrat those damned Yankees were Marauders and thieves for the men women and children held in bondage they represented an opportunity for Freedom the newly liberated slaves flocked to Union soldiers and followed them on their March eventually numbering in the thousands while a morally Good Deed accommodating such a large group of people off of rations and for became a challenge one that many of the officers on the March had opposing solutions to one of which eventually ended in disaster on the 23rd slom's Wing entered the state capital of milleville with the governor and state government fleeing there in the capital building Federal forces held a mock vote to repeal Georgia's secession to the union after seizing the political heart of Georgia without a shot being fired Sherman decided to increase Federal pressure against the Confederacy in addition to more time for foraging federal troops were given more free reign to Target any infrastructure that could Aid the South cotton gens Mills and other centers of manufacturing were burned shelled or rammed even the mansion and personal Plantation of former Governor how Cobbs was put to the torch save for the slaves quarters in addition hundreds of miles of rail line were slowly and meticulously uprooted by federal forces often with soldiers working in shifts using crowbars as they Twisted lines into shapes that were often impossible to repair as the columns began to close in on Savannah Sherman's men were being more frequently inundated by Joseph Wheeler's Confederate skirmishers fed up with the harassment Sherman's Cavalry commander Judson Kilpatrick detached to pursue their base at wboro as Union Cavalry broke through defensive lines and cut off Confederate access to Augusta Willer was forced to withdraw from the town severely diminishing his capacity to slow Sherman's Onslaught as the March progressed the terrain began to change as Union troops entered the low coastal plains of Georgia its low elevation was rich in swamp lands and marshes but not so much in plunder and forage adding further pressure as more fugitive slaves followed the Army on the night of December 8 one of Sherman's subordinates Brigadier General Jefferson C Davis reached ezzar Creek some 20 mi north of Savannah where Army Engineers prepared a pontoon bridge to allow safe passage in what is probably the worst atrocity committed on the March Davis ordered his 14,000 men to cross the bridge over the next few hours and at the last moment ordered the bridge to be cut and pulled back ashore preventing the 600 fugitive slaves from Crossing effectively abandoning them on the west west side of the creek their Fates left to the incoming Confederate Cavalry many of these freed men tried to swim across the icy water for safety some of whom were aided by desperate Union Soldiers but many more were killed or captured by wheeler men many of Davis's men objected to this decision some quite fervently including major James Connelly writing the idea of five or 600 black women children and Old Men being returned to slavery by such an infernal Copperhead as Jeff C Davis was entirely too much I told his staff officers of what I thought of such an inhumane barbarous proceeding despite complaints making it all the way up to Sherman the culpable Brigadier General Davis kept his position due to the lack of experienced field commanders however such an act could not stand to be repeated Sherman thought and must be reconciled this event would be the precipice for special field order number 15 an order made by Sherman to provide aable land for the now liberated slaves and their families considerably less compassionate was Sherman's solution to the use of enemy anti-personnel mines called Torpedoes at the time Sherman's men began encountering these devices as they approached within the final few miles to Savannah which had a devastating terrifying impact on Union morale as his wits end and having seen firsthand the treatment of Union PS by their captors Sherman ordered Confederate prisoners to clear the minefields by any means necessary even when they didn't know where these Torpedoes were planted finally on December 10th Sherman's main Force reached the outskirts of Savannah where they encountered confederate general hardy hardy with his 10,000 troops entrenched had established fortifications that halted the advance of Sherman's main column now hundreds of miles into their journey and hoping to get resupplied for a potential Siege Sherman sent a small contingency to take the coastal Fort mallister swiping away a small Confederate Garrison on the 13th and finally reaching the sea thus allowing the US Navy to resupply the beleaguered forces with a new Supply Route set up for the first time in over a month Sherman sent terms to Hardy on the 17th demanding the surrender of Savannah or face an overwhelming Force given the impossible decision to either surrender or persist Hardy chose neither on the 20th the Confederate Garrison crossed the Savannah River and made its way North forcing the city's mayor to present Sherman with the keys to the city himself General Sherman had done the impossible without Supply or communication from his fellow Northern comrades entirely under his command Sherman had brought Georgia to heal his army paraded through the countryside virtually unchallenged by Confederate resistance emboldened the now historic figure sought to replicate this strategy up through the Carolinas with the same commitment to the scorched Earth tactics that subdued Georgia Sherman was set to cut a bloody path all the way to meet Robert El in his rear flank in 1865 Sherman would add the burning of Colombia South Carolina and the capture of Confederate general Joseph E Johnston to his long list of accomplishments in a campaign that would persist until the end of the war all the while delivering what both his admirers and opponents would call his divine retribution in total it's estimated that Sherman's 37-day campaign did over $100 million in Damages in 1864 which today is about1 billion us with the vast majority of that damage providing little benefit to the marauding Army over 300 Mi of railroad and countless pieces of Southern infrastructure were trashed thousands of horses and cattle as well as millions of pounds of food were seized the March effectively isolated General Lee from most of his remaining peers and allowed Sherman to move north and threaten Lee's army of Northern Virginia with encirclement the March hammered in the first nail of the Confederate coffin culminating in Lee's surrender on April 9th 1865 the reputation of these actions remain debated among historians and history enthusiasts to this day but to truly get a grasp of the motivations behind the Mayhem one has to look at only the words of Sherman himself since the public mind has settled to the conclusion that the institution of slavery was so interwoven in our system that nothing but the interposition of War could have eradicated it I believe that the war was worth all that it cost in life and treasure\",\n",
       " \" North Korea has long been called The Hermit Kingdom through a mix of crippling International sanctions and its own isolationism the northern half of the Korean Peninsula has been virtually cut off from The Wider World however this state's isolation is hardly equivalent to weakness and the world would be foolish to forget that even Hermits can have claws in the aftermath of Japan's defeat in the second world war the Korean Peninsula was split in two the northern half occupied by the Soviets and the southern half by the Americans the Koreans people army or kPa was formed in 1948 to give Kim ilung the soviet-backed leader of Northern Korea the means to conquer the entire Korean Peninsula 2 years later in 1950 Kim elung attempted just that and drove his army all the way to Busan before being defeated by an American Le Counterattack the timely intervention of China saved the newly declared Democratic People's Republic of Korea from complete collapse but the ceasefire that ended the conflict proved to be a frustrating return to the status quo Korea would remain divided in the subsequent decades the unresolved tensions of the Korean war came to define the role of the kPa while the exact tactics and strategies of the kPa have shifted considerably over the years two missions have remained consistent ensuring the stability of the Kim family regime and providing the North Korean state with the means to dominate the Korean Peninsula the first of these missions the protection of the Kim family regime heavily influences the strict and authoritarian structure of the kPa Kim Jong-un the current leader of North Korea is the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army and is the ultimate decision maker in all military matters for the state the Loyalty of the military to Kim alone is ensured by the general political Bureau tasked with providing extensive political indoctrination and the ministry of State security it is a secret police force that reports directly to their Supreme Commander since 2013 Kim Jong-un has also carried out extensive purges to further ensure loyalty resulting in the replacement of up to 80% of the kpa's top commanders as long as the military remains loyal to the Kim family any internal opposition to their rule can be crushed Mass surveillance is a sad reality for the population of North Korea with seemingly every aspect of

code historian the second mission of the kPa a the domination of the Korean Peninsula is closely linked to the geopolitics of North Korea and has shifted significantly over the years in the immediate decades following the Korean War strong Soviet and Chinese Aid gave North Korea a technological and economic Edge over its Southern neighbor emboldening the nation's military planners to build an army that could go on the offensive and strike deep into South Korean territory with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 however economic and military aid to North Korea halted and the country entered an economic and humanitarian death spiral that it has never truly recovered from additionally as the economy and population of South Korea rapidly grew it became increasingly unlikely that North Korea could win any conventional military campaign on the peninsula once the more powerful of the two koreas North Korea increasingly found itself on the back foot the present-day strategy and structure of the kPa reflects this unfavorable reality gone are the days where North Korean planners imagined sweeping offensives into the South instead the Korean People's Army has increasingly focused on asymmetric Warfare deterrence and coercion if the kPa cannot dominate the Korean Peninsula through conventional means it will dominate it through fear while North Korea is one of the world's poorest countries it spends up to 25% of its GDP on defense and possesses the world's fourth largest military with nearly 1.3 million active Personnel of the five service branches of the kPa the Strategic Force has become by far the most important in North Korea's national defense strategy although North Korea's nuclear program dates back to the 1950s North Korea's nuclear capabilities have quite literally exploded since its first successful nuclear test in 2006 under Kim Jong-un in particular North Korea's nuclear Arsenal has grown exponentially while the exact size and capabilities of the country's nuclear stockpile is unknown recent estimates suggest that North Korea possesses between 35 and 65 nuclear devices with anywhere from 4 to 12 added every year the kpa's Strategic Force claims to operate ballistic missiles that could launch these weapons into South Korea Japan or even the United States although it should be noted that there is no conclusive evidence for this for North Korea the possession of nuclear weapons acts as a key deterrent and bargaining chip signaling to the world the cost of any potential assault on the country this threat is underlined by Kim jong-un's continued assertion that he alone will make any decision to use North Korea's nuclear Arsenal meaning that any perceived threat to his power could end in armag gedon the largest branch of the kPa the ground force also plays a key role in North Korea's strategic calculus with over a million soldiers 4,000 tanks and 21,000 artillery pieces the ground force still forms the core of the Korean people's Army's strength despite its vast number of soldiers and armored vehicles however the ground force is judged largely incapable of carrying out large-scale offensive operations due to its limited Logistics and hopelessly outdated equipment While most Frontline divisions of the ground forces operate Cold War era equipment such as the t62 or btr60 the kPa does still field equipment as old as the t34 however the lack of modern mechanized capabilities does not make the ground force harmless to begin the Infantry heavy force is well suited to defend the demilitarized zone on the North Korean border which has been fortified with extensive tunnel networks bunkers and minefields approximately 70% of the ground Force's considerable strength is concentrated on this border making any enemy breakthrough exceptionally challenging additionally North Korea's massive paramilitary organization known as worker peasants Red Guard possesses over 5 million members and would be able to supplement the ground force in times of War providing the kPa with a nearly inexhaustible supply of troops and the ability to wage a protracted Guerilla campaign against any Invader finally rounding out the kpa's focus on deterrence and Terror the ground force maintains nearly 6,000 artillery systems within range of South Korean population centers with essentially zero warning these weapons give North Korea the capability to cause an estimated 100,000 casualties an hour in the opening stages of any conflict with South Korea these casualty numbers could be even higher if the ground force chooses to launch its ample supply of chemical and biological rounds in the skies above the ground force merciless bombardment the North Korean Air Force would also be active in any potential conflict with 110,000 personnel and an estimated 545 combat capable aircraft the kPa Air Force is a formidable organization on paper however with many of its aircraft such as the Mig 15 dating back to as early as the 1950s the Air Force would likely not last long in any modern conflict compounding this issue are fuel shortages and maintenance problems which result in the average North Korean pilot training for as little as 15 hours every year which is less than the average American pilot flies every month nevertheless the North Korean Air Force also Fields the heaviest concentrations of anti-air weapons on Earth making enemy air superiority over the country far from certain the kPa Navy is the smallest branch of North Korea's armed forces and is like other branches primarily focused on deterrents with only two naan class frigs dating from the 1970s the kPa Navy's conventional surface capabilities are essentially non-existent Instead North Korea operates over 370 small attack craft and a fleet of over 70 diesel electric submarines split between the country's two coasts While most of these systems are significantly outdated and would likely serve as little more than target practice to more modern navies if they ventured too far from North Korea's Coast the sheer number of these craft means that they could prove sufficient to threaten supply lines and disrupt any attempted amphibious attack standing out from the rest of its Fleet however North Korea has built two submarines claimed to be capable of launching ballistic missiles though the true ability of these craft to successfully launch a nuclear nulear Warhead remains an open question the world may never want to find out the final branch of the kPa is also its most elite the Special Operations force is perhaps the largest Special Forces organization in the world with up to 200,000 soldiers of these elite soldiers about 88,000 are estimated to be under the direct command of the Special Operations Force while the rest are spread out over the other branches compared to the rest of the Korean People's Army the Special Operation force is provided with the best available equipment though this is still rudimentary by Western standards in independent operations special forces are trained to be inserted behind South Korean lines through either amphibious or Airborne methods these Elite Personnel would then be tasked with disrupting South Korean supply lines and targeting critical infrastructure at the unit level Special Operation soldiers also provide reconnaissance and light infantry capabilities to the less well equipped Ground Force complimenting their conventional military North Korea also possesses potent cyber warfare capabilities North Korean cyber operations support the country's military goals by giving the Kim regime a deniable way to spy on and intimidate its adversaries us intelligence Services notably linked North Korean cyber forces to the 2014 Sony picture hack which may have been motivated by the upcoming release of the movie the interview North Korea also uses its cyber operations to steal from financial institutions around the world allowing the capability to potentially pay for itself so where will the Korean People's Army go from here to begin it's very likely that North Korea will continue to give nuclear weapons and the Strategic force a leading role in the nation's military strategy it was once hoped that North Korea Korea could be convinced to give up its nuclear weapons but with the possession of nuclear weapons now legally enshrined in the country's Constitution North Korea seems to have firmly chosen its path next it is likely that North Korea will continue to utilize unconventional methods to undermine its enemies an example of this strategy is the ongoing transfer of artillery rounds from KPA storehouses to the battlefields of Ukraine finally even though North Korea's nuclear capabilities will likely continue to advance this will probably not be the case for the rest of the kpa's Arsenal critical shortages across the entire defense sector mean that the kPa remains largely incapable of modernizing its Force to any significant degree in other words anticipate more nukes but don't expect the t-34s to go anywhere just yet the Korean People's Army remains a deadly threat to any wouldbe Invaders but many shortcom comings remain forged in the violence of the Korean War the kPa is well suited to the defense of its Homeland and focuses its relatively limited resources on deterrence and Terror Cold War era equipment and poor Logistics make any offensive operation into South Korea a virtual nonstarter but kPa artillery and missiles could still devastate South Korean population centers at a moment's notice more worryingly as North

       " \" it is the early 1970s while the world's attention is fixated on the jungles of Vietnam another conflict equally intense and complex was unfolding in the thickets of southern Africa like most conflicts to come out of Africa the origin of rhia's struggle can be traced back to the colonial era in the 19th century the resourcer areas of masona land and maab land came to the atten of British mining magnate Cecil roads making use of his own Venture the British South Africa company RADS was able to force his way into the region despite resistance from indigenous Shona and indele communities over time British settlers flocked to the area looking for work and land to call their own here the British South Africa company was given complete control over the area's Administration in 1895 this commercial Venture was officially named rhia in honor of their company's founder despite numerous treaties Stark contrasts in politics and issues of land ownership between white settlers and the local black population swed seeds of racial tension this Discord simmered beneath the surface persisting even as the region transitioned from a corporate charter into a self-governing colony under the British crown in 1923 to different at it from northern Rhodesia this transition came with the official renaming of Southern rodesia throughout decolonization in the 1960s British Africa moved toward granting Independence via the policy of no Independence before majority rule this sparked Panic among the ruling class of white rodians who feared upheaval akin to the chaos that racked the Belgian Congo post independence disenchanted by the British labor government's perceived favoritism toward African Liberation rhia's white minority government brazenly declared independence on November 11th 1965 via the unilateral Declaration of Independence or Udi for the rodians this was perceived as an act of survival as prime minister Ian Smith stated rodesia did not want to seize independence from Britain it was forced upon us this internationally unrecognized Act aimed to maintain control amidst geopolitical shifts isolating rodesia internationally with only covert support from South Africa and Portuguese mosm Beek as rodesia sank deeper into racial and economic turmoil the fervor for majority rule among black nationalists intensified and political discourse shifted toward a path of armed resistance 1961 to 1963 witnessed the rise of two nationalist factions whose resistance was key to instigating the coming conflict though United in their goal to dismantle white

forces next was the Zimbabwe African National Union or zanu which split off from zapu in 1963 Guided by indin ningi SLE and later Robert Mugabe zanu primarily garnered support from the Shona ethnic group and embraced a maist ideology with China providing support the military Wing known as the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army or zanla was run by a committee within the party zanla utilized Guerilla Warfare exploiting the rural landscape and and engaging local communities to conduct a prolonged people's war against Rhian forces opposing these factions were these Security Forces operating under the Rhian government during the early Wars of the conflict this responsibility was handled by the British South Africa police who made use of specialized teams like the police anti-terrorist unit to combat Guerilla activity in remote areas of the country when it became clear that the conflict would drag on the security force was ramped up to include the Rhian Army and Air Force the Army in particular made use of specialized units like the formidable Rhian light infantry and the rhia regiment which formed the core of the defense against insurgencies the light infantry known as troopes were renowned for their airborne and combat prowess often leading counterinsurgency operations Elite groups such as the cus Scouts and the Special Air Service enhanced the arm Army's capabilities with their expertise in reconnaissance covert operations and high stakes Airborne missions the rodian African rifles predominantly black soldiers commanded by white officers leveraged their local knowledge in crucial counter Insurgency operations the Rhian Air Force ensured aerial Supremacy providing Vital Air Support reconnaissance and Casualty evacuation amplifying the operational scope of ground forces together these units and to enforce the established order in July 1964 the Ambush and killing of white foremen Andrew oberholzer by xanu insurgents sent shock waves through rhia's white Community the Smith Administration in rapid response detained key leaders from zanu and zapu including Joshua and KO and dingi sit hole and Robert Mugabe all sentenced to 10 years in prison despite their incarceration and the official Banning of both parties the military wings of zipra and zanla persisted operating from Exile in Zambia and later mosm Beek the gorillas escalated their activities into a full Insurgency initiating what would become a protracted Bush War following the unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 the conflict intensified throughout these embed Valley while embargos from Britain and the United Nations effectively shut off International contact with Smith's government in Salisbury despite these setbacks rhia was able to secure essential War supplies via South Africa Portugal and intricate smuggling operations that allowed for a degree of self-sufficiency early military engagements spanning April to September 1966 saw a slew of operations aimed at combating raids and the potential build of insurgence in the country 1967 to 1968 saw zipra and zanla respond by stepping up their campaigns with rodians in turn launching another tide of operations aimed at suppressing their activity some of these engagements like operation nickel and cauldron even involved outside intervention from Encanto we seway the paramilitary wing of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress together the these Guerilla factions sought to destabilize the control of security forces in the region win the local populaces Allegiance and carve out a base for impending operations all important steps toward dismantling white minority rule for their country in contrast Rhian Security Forces with crucial reinforcement from South Africa and Portuguese forces in mosm Beek aimed to quash the burgeoning threat and retain control over important territories the beginning of of the 1970s saw Insurgent forces continue to operate from secluded bases in regions sympathetic to Black Liberation these mainly included Zambia and areas of Portuguese mosm Beek controlled by Fimo or The Liberation Front Of mosm Beek whose own struggle mirrored events happening in rodesia Ian Smith's government was also keenly aware of the rising collaboration that the gorillas had with outside forces following a raid on mamb Beek's matim base in March 1972 the revelation of joint zanla for Lio infiltrations throughout T Province indicated zanu's growing threat what was once a ragtag group of revolutionaries had emerged into a serious Force thanks to assistance from Beijing meanwhile zapu was reeling from previous defeats within rodesia and seized active participation in the conflict as they focused instead on consolidating its position and sending militants abroad for extended training across Russia Cuba and North Korea this development was concerning for Smith who in December remarked the security situation is far more serious than it appears on the surface and if the man in the street could have access to the security information which I and my colleagues in government have then I think he would be a lot more worried than he is today 17 days later zanla forces led a daring attack on ala farm and in response Rhian Security Forces launched operation hurricane which targeted Guerilla bases and supply routes primarily in the northeastern region of the country this also marked the first of many major operations to come operation hurricane unfolded with a series of aerial bombardments ground assaults and intelligence gathering reconnaissance missions aimed at tracking gorilla movements while it achieved some success in mitigating gorilla threats it also underscored the Rhian forces inability to fully secure border areas thereby enabling ongoing Guerilla infiltrations and foreshadowing an escalation in violence for 3 years the conflict was largely contained to rhia's Northeast but the gorillas growing in determination experience and discipline used whatever means necessary to gain the upper hand in some cases this meant leveraging the influence of spirit mediums conducting child abductions for re-education and deploying landmines in Response Security Forces tried to counter this influence by imposing fines creating buffer zones manipulating friendly mediums and establishing protected Villages by 1974 conditions surrounding the bush War had shifted dramatically with the fall of Portuguese occupied mosm Beek and Angola rodesia found itself grappling with an additional 700 mes of border to defend and four more months of conflict a Seas fire initiated by South Africa inadvertently allowed gorillas to regroup while also prompting the release of detained nationalist leaders in 1975 South Africa withdrew its police from rodesia yet the war decelerated as zanu and zapu embroiled in internal conflicts targeted each other as much as they did sec Security Forces leaders were assassinated and zanla facing imprisonment of its leaders and an increasing reluctant Zambia shifted operations to mosm Beek rodesia enforced a Dusk to Dawn curfew along substantial portions of the mosambique and batswana borders by early 1976 zanla reinitiated conflict on multiple fronts focusing on vulnerable targets and evading direct confrontations to counteract escalating incursions on the the Eastern Highlands Security Forces launched operation Thrasher intensifying military engagements in the Strategic region with both Rhian and Guerilla forces adapting to the rugged terrain and evolving conflict Dynamics each vying for territorial control with mounting pressure from every direction Rhian security relied on the Armed Forces more than ever since 1974 the use of their fireforce military tactics saw airmobile and paratrooper infantry quickly responding to Guerilla sightings making use of air power to envelop insurgents wherever they cropped up still it wasn't enough to stem the tide and in some cases the fight had to be taken outside of national borders as was the case with the NAD zonia raid on August 19th 1976 codenamed operation Eland the raid on the neonia base in mosambique aimed to dismantle its importance as a logistics hub for zanla which housed approximately 5,000 personnel and a large Hospital led by 84 cellus Scouts under Captain Rob warer the operation involved a crossb raid into mosm Beek using vehicles and uniforms disguised as felo for infiltration Guided by former zanla Commander Morrison naath the Raiders entered the camp and upon a signal opened fire on the assembled gorillas while successful in dismantling the base this operation stirred controversy besides gorilla Fighters the camp also housed refugees including old people women and young children Amnesty International claimed that the operation killed 1,000 people while the political Fallout caused a strain in Rhian South African relations more importantly South Africa withdrew their Military Support which pushed Ian Smith to reconsider the principle of black majority rule in September by 1977 the country was divided into eight geographical operational areas while these were active Security Forces launched another crossborder operation on November 23rd operation dingo targeted the zanla headquarters near chimeo in mosm Beek the Rhian forces comprising 96 SAS 48 light infantry paratroopers and an additional 40 helicopter transported troopes or orchestrated a meticulously planned attack the operation commenced with a deceptive flyby from A Douglas DCA airliner which lulled zanla forces into a false sense of security following this the operation continued with air strikes from canara and Hunter aircraft as well as ground assaults and helicopter gunship engagements despite the strategical and tactical Precision notable zanla commanders including Josiah tongogara and Rex n go managed to escape due to an incomplete envelopment by the Rhian forces according to the Rhian combined Operation Center dingo claimed over 1200 zanla casualties it also sparked further controversy regarding civilian deaths and was later utilized in political narratives by the gorillas to showcase the brutality of Smith's regime the aftermath of operation dingo intertwined with complex political Dynamics including negotiations between Bishop AEL mua of the United African National Council and Ian Smith leading to a March 1978 Accord aimed at transitioning toward majority rule however this was denounced by Guerilla forces who saw the Accord as favoring white control while lacking any attempt to dismantle racial discrimination the subsequent years saw an escalation in the conflict with zanu under Robert Mugabe declaring 1978 as the year of the people and deploying at at least 13,000 zanla troops in Rhodesia by the end of 1978 all sides of the conflict had been mired in controversy the laying of extensive Mine Fields along with the use of biological and chemical weapons by Security Forces had given the gorillas further impetus to press their attacks however both zipra and zanla were often indiscriminate in their killing with continued raids on white farming communities along with in inous events like the Downing of Civilian Viscount planes by zipra militants or the horrific Elum Mission Massacre by zanla forces zapu and zanu pressed on their offensives with zanla aggressively expanding Westward while zipra responded by pushing East each faction vied for control over as many tribal lands as possible which led to skirmishes between zanla and zipra militants the entire central region of rodesia became a potential flasho threatening to escalate into a full-blown Civil War amidst this volatile backdrop the Rhian Security Forces struggled to neutralize this Brewing internal conflict in large part due to Manpower shortages attempts to alleviate this through foreign volunteers like the American crippled Eagles and French seven independent company had failed with issues of morale discipline and unit integration hindering rodian forces overall legislation to conscript black rodians was introduced in 1979 but few responded to the draft leaving the Armed Forces to rely on a meager pool of overworked Personnel meanwhile 1979 saw internal politics mired by failed agreements and the establishment of the short-lived state of Zimbabwe rodesia under its new prime minister Abel muua this government ultimately lacked International recognition due to its exclusion of key nationalist factions like zapu and zanu it was the Lancaster house agreement in 1979 which marked the true shift toward peace a compromise was forged leading to a ceasefire and a temporary reversion to British rule this symbolized the end of rodesia and the birth of Zimbabwe the subsequent 1980 election marred by allegations of voter intimidation and Military considerations of a coup saw Robert mugabi's Ascension to power Zimbabwe emerged From the Ashes

defeat in the Russo Japanese war which we the government's position and exposed the limitations of its military and Industry this was the first time a European great power had been decisively defeated by an Asian one and it was a huge blow to Russian Prestige this and the substantial amount of casualties that the Russians suffered contributed to Growing domestic unrest which culminated in the 1905 Russian Revolution while the Revolution was unsuccessful ful in stopping Zar Nicholas it severely damaged the reputation of the Russian autocracy as a result when the austr Hungarian Arch Duke France Ferdinand was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb in June of 1914 the Russians were quick to act though Austria Hungary couldn't find evidence that the Serbian state had sponsored the assassination it issued an ultimatum the Russians who had declared themselves Protectors of Christian in the Balkans for centuries now were afraid of austr Hungarian domination in the region this alongside pans Slavic sentiment convinced the Russians to back Serbia even if they had no formal treaty obligation France who had an alliance with Russia also reassured their support if War sparked tensions boiled over and Austria Hungary declared war on July 28th Russia came to Serbia's defense and days after alliances had been drawn in Germany France and Britain what had begun as a Balkan crisis had evolved into a worldwide conflict with the central powers on one side and the triple anant on the other I'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video Opus clip the number one generative AI video tool that turns

Manpower its resources were not fully exploited the reforms they had enacted after the Russo Japanese war had not been enough to completely revamp their military industrial complex which was still weak most notably in the state of their railroads Russia's vast territory presented logistical challenges making it difficult to maintain a continuous supply of men and resources to the front lines poor Transportation infrastructure hindered effective mobilization and troop movements the Russian army was IL prepared for Modern Warfare relying on outdated strategies and Equipment the rigid hierarchical structure and lack of proper training and Leadership further hampered the military's performance nonetheless Russia launched offensives into East Prussia and Austria Hungary initially the Russians were successful with the first and second armies advancing into East Prussia and even achieving victory at the Battle of gumin on August 20th although the Russians wanted to threaten coxburg the Russian second Army would be annihilated at the Battle of taner with the Germans capturing over 100,000 prisoners in the conflict's aftermath the Russian army would be defeated once again at the Battle of missan lakes being kicked out of East Prussia for good after their successes in East Prussia the Germans aimed to take Warsaw and fought the Russians at the Battle of the Vistula River but were repelled building on this defensive success the Russians attacked Silesia aiming to take the city of breau but were repulsed and retreated to Wood which would fall by the end of November the first 4 months of the war had taken its toll not only on the morale of the Russians but also on material as they were already low on guns and ammunition against the austr hungarians Russia started with defeats first with the Battle of kashik and later kamarov however at Gila Lipa they drove away the Ostro hun hungarians and captured Lamberg the Russian push into Gala was quite successful taking much land and capturing tens of thousands of austr Hungarian prisoners many of them were austr Hungarian Slavs Czechs slovaks croats and bosnians and Russia portrayed itself as a liberator of subjugated people soon after the Russians laid Siege to The Fortress of pishu which they captured along with more than 100,000 prisoners in March of 1915 Russia's third adversary the Ottoman Empire would join the war in October of 1914 after bombarding Russian Black Sea ports the initial Russian casis belli had been defending their fellow slaves but as the dead mounted this wasn't an especially sellable cause to the Russian public the involvement of the Ottoman Empire which historically had been akin to an arch rival to the Russians made the war more logical to public perception furthermore Russian officials managed to extract a commitment from Britain and France that Russia would take Constantinople at the end of the war formerly the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire which Russia claimed to be the successor of the city would also give Russia access to the Mediterranean the fighting between the Ottomans and Russians would mostly take place in the Caucasus a region rif with ethnic and religious tension both sides would exploit these tensions with the Russians vaguely promising Independence for the Armenians in exchange for assistance against the Ottoman Empire the ottoman Sultan would also use his religious position to leverage support for the war proclaiming a Jihad against the anant in December the Ottomans crossed into Russian Georgia and captured ardahan murdering many Christians in response when the Russians retook it in early 1950 they retaliated killing many in the Muslim Community later the Russians alongside their Armenian allies would achieve a massive victory at sari kames in January of 1915 in response the ottoman violence against the Armenians began to spiral out of control eventually leading to The Armenian genocide in April of 1915 the Germans and austr hungarians launched the gorita tarnoff offensive achiev aing a major breakthrough reversing the Russian gains in Gala and capturing over 140,000 Men by June both pishu and lenberg were in the hands of the Central Powers again the Germans would continue to build on their success seizing Warsaw rest lovk and vus the Russians had suffered heavily as a result of these offensives in July assistant minister of War General Mikel bov pleaded with the French Ambassador for help and revealed that in some infantry regiments one man in three had no rifle the poor fellows wait patiently under the hail of shrapnel for their comrades to fall so they can collect their weapons faced with insurmountable pressure the Russians began the great retreat in which they relinquished over 100,000 square km to the Central Powers while the withdrawal did shorten their front lines and allow for a much needed respit it was a huge blow to morale disillusioned with the constant military struggles Zar Nicholas decided to make himself the supreme commander of the Russian forces tying his regime to success in the war while a large part of Russia's involvement in the war had been due to its role as the preeminent Slavic power the Russian Empire was incredibly diverse large minorities of poles ukrainians Germans Baltic and Central Asian people lived within the Russian borders while the Russians retreated the Germans continued to advance capturing the fortresses at kovno and Novo geores that being said the Germans would be routed at The Fortress of oves in an action that would later be immortalized as the attack of the dead men after their initial bombardment and assault was repelled by the Russians the Germans would surround the Fortress for months on August 6th the Germans decided to use poison gas to root the maskless Russians out the gas proved deadly leading to extremely heavy casualties on the Russian side as the Germans Advanced to take the Russian positions in what they expected to be an unimpeded assault the surviving Russians bloody with chemical burns wrapped up in rags and spitting out blood counterattacked in a bayonet charge shocked by the sight of what appeared to be dead men charging against them the Germans retreated the newspaper would later call this Counterattack the attack of the dead men nonetheless this heroic action would be in vain as the Russians would later abandon the Fortress to the Germans as the war continued its impact on Russia's society and economy was profound and destabilizing the cost of financing the war effort strained the economy leading to inflation scarcity of goods and food shortages the hardships faced by the Russian people during the war fueled discontent and social unrest strikes protest test and bread riots became more prevalent as the war dragged on further weakening the government's ability to maintain control the harsh living conditions and lack of faith in the ruling class created an environment ripe for revolutionary sentiments among the most notorious figures in the Russian court at the time was gregori Rasputin a Mystic holy man who had befriended the royal family and acted as a faith healer for Zar Nicholas's only son Al who suffered from hemophilia many in the court saw him as little more than a religious charlatan that discredited the Zar as Russian military defeats mounted on both the royal family and Ras Putin continued to become increasingly unpopular and eventually Rasputin was assassinated by a group of conservative Russian noblemen who opposed his influence over the Imperial family nonetheless Rasputin's association with the royal family left its mark discrediting the government in the eyes of many in March 1916 the Russians initiated the disastrous Lake narch offensive in the vus area during which the Germans suffered only 1th as many casualties as the Russians many of the Russian casualties would come at the hand of the cold with thousands of soldiers succumbing to hypothermia due to Dreadful Supply conditions the offensive had taken place at the west of France who had hoped it would force the Germans to transfer more units to the East and relieve some pressure from the Battle of Verdan the Germans and austr hungarians fell into complacency after repelling the Russian attacks with the austr Hungarian leadership transferring units from both the Balkan and Russian front to the Italian one many of the experienced divisions on the Eastern Front were withdrawn and sent to the Alps and replaced by formations largely composed of new inexperienced recruits this reshuffling presented an opportunity to the Russians at a war council held with senior commanders and thear in April of 1916 General Alexi bruil presented a plan to the Russian high command proposing a massive offensive against the austr Hungarian forces in Galicia bruff's plan aimed to take some of the pressure off the French and British armies in France and the Italian Army along the isanzo his plan had a mixed reception with some commanders favoring a more defensive strategy but the Zar would nonetheless approve the plan although he did deny brail's request for supporting offensives on June 4th 1916 the Russians opened the offensive with heavy artillery fire brusilov's troops made quick work of the austr hungarians within 4 days of the offensive the austr Hungarian fourth Army had its strength fall from 11 17,800 men to just 35,000 a fall of nearly 70% braila used smaller specialized units to attack weak points in the austr Hungarian trench lines and blow open holes for the rest of the army to advance into these tactics were a remarkable departure from the human wave tactics that had dominated the strategy of all major armies until that point in the first world war soon the Germans began sending reinforcements to prevent the austr hungarians from collapsing and the Russian Advance was slowed but not stopped while the Russians still outnumbered their Germanic opponents their Advance became more and more costly until they were ultimately stopped in the outskirts of the Galician town of Koval attacks continued until the Autumn rains turned the roads to Mud but other than adding to the already terrible casualty list nothing substantial was achieved the damage the brila offensive inflicted meant that the austr Hungarian Army increasing ly had to rely on the support of the Germans it also achieved its original goal disrupting Germany's attack on Verdun and having them transfer forces to the east the early success of the offensive also convinced Romania to join the war on the side of the anant but they would soon be defeated and occupied by the Central Powers the units commanded by brila directly performed very well but the overall campaign was tremendously costly for the Imperial Army with more than half a million men becoming casualties continuing the war was an especially costly Affair for the Russian Empire as a result Zar Nicholas declared a draft of Central Asian men which was unprecedented the Muslim Central Asians had not heeded the ottoman call for Jihad but the draft alongside the rampant Corruption of the Russian regime was too much to bear soon the Kix and kgis were up in arms and thousands of Russian troops were dispatched to put them down the suppression of the Revolt was brutal and led to over 100,000 deaths due to violence disease and the famine that followed hundreds of thousands of central Asians fled into China and the Russian Empire never managed to fully restore order to the region the mounting discontent and frustration with the government's handling of the war culminated in a revolution in February 1917 the February Revolution led to the abdication of Zar Nicholas II and the establishment of a provincial government led by liberal politicians who aimed to continue the war effort and Implement Democratic reforms however the provisional government shared power with the petrograd Soviet a body representing workers and soldiers this Arrangement led to a state of dual power and political instability as the two bodies had conflicting interests and goals while the provisional government's decision to continue the war was unpopular it was the catastrophic kinsky offensive in July 197 that destroyed any morale left in the Russian army along with the image of the provisional government the Army by now was plagued with desertion and Disobedience with many soldiers alluding ignoring officers orders or even outright attacking them amid the chaos and disillusionment the Bolshevik party led by Vladimir Lenin capitalized I ized on popular discontent and actively promoted slogans of Peace land and bread the Bolsheviks aimed to end Russia's involvement in the war redistribute land to The Peasants and provide food to the starving population the October revolution of 1917 spearheaded by the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government and established a communist one keeping to their word the Bolsheviks would end Russia's participation in the war negotiating with Germany and signing the Treaty of breast Lov ending the fighting on December 16th 1917 the price for peace was a heavy one not only did Russia have to concede vast swaths of land to the Central Powers but they also lost millions of men in combat and decimated their economy unfortunately peace with these Central Powers did not mean an end to Russian suffering as soon after the country would devolve into Civil War Russia's participation in the first world war had profound consequences that transformed the country's political and social landscape the war exposed Russia's weaknesses exacerbated internal divisions and led to the downfall of the Imperial regime ultimately Paving the way for the rise of Communism the Russian experience during the war serves as a stark reminder of the human cost and complexity of global conflicts leaving an enduring impact on the nation's history the tragic transformation of Russia during the first world war and the subsequent Russian Revolution left an indelible mark on the 20th century and significantly shaped the course of the world's political and social developments\",\n",
       " \" [Music] the end of the American Civil War marked a turning point in the history of the United States while the north emerged Victorious The South was left in Ruins and its people deeply divided for former Confederate soldiers the defeat meant grappling with a new reality their way of life and their cause were lost some chose to adapt to the new circumstances While others clung to the past or even left the country I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian and in today's video we'll discover what happened to Confederates after the American Civil War despite four years of brutal Bloodshed the end of the American Civil War was not a time of Vengeance and Punishment with Union troops lording over and abusing the erstwhile Rebels President Abraham Lincoln ordered that surrendering Confederates be offered the most liberal and honorable terms and order the Union's overall commander and future president General Ulysses S Grant followed when his Confederate counterpart General Robert E Lee formally surrendered at Appomattox on April 9 1865 Grant permitted all soldiers in Lee's army to keep their personal effects and horses when the Confederates formally handed over their battle flags and weaponry three days later Union Officers were ordered to show the utmost military respect including saluting as both officers and rank and files surrendered their arms and standards though other Confederate armies and formations would surrender in the upcoming months these ceremonies at Appomattox Mark the accepted end of the American Civil War the war had left the Southern United States devastated as scorched Earth campaigns by generals like William Tecumseh Sherman gutted infrastructure and the abolition of slavery collapsed its plantation-based economy the federal government was left debating how best to bring the rebels back into the fold with President Lincoln Desiring quick and amicable reintegration Lincoln proposed a general amnesty for any who had taken up the Confederate cause and that southern states be readmitted under the political control of these Southern whites once 10 percent of a given State's voters had sworn an oath of allegiance to the United States the state would be readmitted to the union and could re-establish its government and internal systems this plan was rejected outright by Radical Republicans a faction of Lincoln's party that sought to punish the South for slavery Insurrection or both radicals in Congress proposed their own plan requiring a full 50 of Southern voters to swear their loyalty to the union before their state could be readmitted a figure that could not be reached so close to the war and would have effectively prohibited the readmittance of Southern States but Lincoln capped to his hopes creating a legislative deadlock between him and The Radical Republicans a deadlock John Wilkes Booth broke at Ford's Theater the death of Lincoln marked a turn in the fortunes of the former Confederates as former slaveholder and Tennessean Andrew Johnson assumed the highest office in the land reconstruction the turbulent post-war period had begun Southern Devastation was economic and demographic 200 to 300 000 men died while wearing the Confederate gray a full quarter of the male population between 17 and 50. families were left without Fathers and Sons businesses without owners and workers and political offices vacant those men who survived the war returned to find their home States a smoking ruin with Union General Charles schurtz describing the site former Rebels returned to a broad black streak of Ruin and desolation the fences all gone Lonesome Smoke Stacks surrounded by dark heaps of ashes and Cinders marking spots where human habitation had stood the American Civil

for free using our Link in the description below this broad black streak teamed with destitute refugees masses of former slave owners average southern people and newly freed slaves left to contend with the physical and economic ruin a full two-thirds of the South's wealth had been consumed by the Civil War leaving what was once a hotbed of agrarian industry unable to even feed its population South Carolina the state where the war arguably started was forced to sell 300 000 or 5.5 million in today's dollars worth of bonds just to buy corn to feed its starving population the treasury Department did little to help these situation with treasury agents sweeping into the South to seize abandoned property including stocks of the South's last major resource cotton treasury agents decreed that this cotton was to be seized as War reparations but the men in charge of such dealings were far from honest a system emerged in which Southern cotton owners would avoid having their stocks seized by swearing that they had never been disloyal to the United States however these Arrangements often involved collusion between wealthy Southerners and treasury agents as a result a portion of the unseased cotton would be sold by the agents for personal profit although most returned to igaw a living in their ruined land not all were willing to abide by the South's new social order or risk persecution for their participation in the war a number of Confederate politicians fled to Europe such as Secretary of State Judah P Benjamin and Secretary of War John C Breckenridge who found shelter in Britain before dying in Paris and returning home on a pardon respectively Confederate President Jefferson Davis attempted a similar Escape but was captured by federal Cavalry Rank and file Confederates cast their eyes even further south with a number settling in Mexico these men reasoned that the United States would come to blows with Mexico again and they could once more March against the Yankees but Mexico was a nation without slavery an institution many ex-confederates still held close to their hearts and as luck would have it so did The Empire of Brazil sensing a New Economic Opportunity for his vast Nation Brazilian Emperor Dom Pedro II offered cheap farmland and Sanctuary to any Confederates who settled in Brazil intent on leveraging Southern expertise in farming cotton with local slave labor 20 000 Confederates took Pedro up on his offer establishing the town of Americana roughly 260 miles from the city of Sao Paulo the immigrants found Brazil to their liking with one transplant musing the war-worn soldier the bereaved parent the oppressed Patriot the homeless and despoiled can find Refuge from the trials which beset them and a home not haunted by the Eternal remembrance of harrowing scenes of sorrow and death the citizens of Americana continue to celebrate Confederate Memorial days and exhibit reverence for 19th century Southern Culture even as Brazil abolished slavery in 1888 and many prominent Rebels Jefferson Davis and Robert E Lee among them condemned the Americana project in their lifetimes it was these same prominent Rebels that found themselves squarely in President Johnson's sights while a general amnesty was declared for Rank and file Confederates an exception was made for those with property worth more than twenty thousand dollars or three hundred and seventy thousand dollars in modern times this placed wealthy Planters and Confederate leadership in the position of having to specifically and publicly apply for clemency supplicating themselves before Washington other exceptions included Confederate president Davis who was kept manacled under strict guard while the U.S decided what to charge him with the conditions of his imprisonment made Davis a martyr to Southerners and earned him sympathy from the Yankee public though Davis would never be tried for any crimes against the United States other high-ranking Confederates would be indicted for treason and one Confederate officer Henry Wertz was executed for war crimes in wurz's case for the deplorable and deadly conditions of the Andersonville prison yet even as his government made these shows a force Johnson followed many of Lincoln's ideas for reconstruction to the point of being more lenient in readmitting States Johnson declared that North Carolina could reapply for admission when its citizens had written a new state constitution and formed a government loyal to the United States eliminating the requirements for Oaths of Allegiance this set a precedent and the unrestored States rushed to meet these terms themselves in hopes of rejoining the Union without Federal interference and many former Confederate luminaries would use their State's readmission as a ticket back to political power all in all the former Vice President of the Confederacy four Confederate generals five Confederate Colonels six Confederate cabinet officers and 58 Confederate congressmen went to Washington thanks to the 1865 election across the South candidates for official positions often had late of the Confederacy printed on their tickets to solicit support for their election some of those elected proudly wore their uniforms to their State's legislative sessions however Southerners would join the government to promote unity and reconstruction such as noted confederate general James Longstreet Longstreet was initially indicted for treason but his case was dismissed at the insistence of Union general grant writing in a New Orleans paper regarding reconstruction he stated that the war was made upon Republican issues and it seems to me fair and just that the settlement should be made accordingly Longstreet would go on to join the Republican party promoting reconstruction and criticizing his former Commander Robert E Lee at any opportunity his position on reconstruction was deemed treacherous by most Southerners white Southerners regardless of their feelings on reconstruction could not tolerate the sight of their land being occupied by federal troops many of whom were black they bristled at this seeing the federals as Invaders and the presence of black soldiers as a calculated insult in reality the quick establishment of state governments under Johnson's presidency meant actual troop numbers in the South were small and they dwindled rapidly with each year of reconstruction but racism was not limited to being insulted at the presence of black troops slavery may have legally been over but the South sought to maintain white supremacy in every facet of Life while Southerners fear for their position was existential reconstruction meant voting rights for black people a prospect the former Confederates saw as little more than a ploy to create one-party Republican rule as states were reorganized legislators pushed to pass us Black Codes that granted black citizens basic rights on paper but in reality placed so many restrictions and caveats on them that black Southerners were reduced to near slave status black citizens were compelled to enter into paid labor contracts that put them into indentured servitude to whoever employed them with individuals empowered to arrest and return any black employee who left their job before their contract expired the federal government saw these acts as an attempt to revive slavery in all but name something unacceptable to the republican-controlled Congress in order to Stave off attempts at reintroducing slavery in a new guise the federal government had created the Freedmen's Bureau while this agency was set up shortly prior to the end of the war to assist refugees and displaced persons of all Races it was intended to assist recently freed slaves in particular the bureau set up schools and hospitals mediated labor negotiations but between businesses and emancipated workers and held confiscated land to be parceled out as 40 acres and a mule President Johnson however pressured the bureau to return confiscated lands to their original Confederate owners with freedmen receiving little land of their own the bureau was more successful in establishing schools and hospitals treating hundreds of thousands of patients and educating many first-generation students however these acts ran contrary to former Confederate values Anthony recently reconstituted state governments made it clear that the bureau had no real Authority in their borders former Confederates saw the bureau as virtually a foreign government forced upon them and supported by an army of occupation While others declared it an enemy of Southern sovereignty President Johnson soon came out as an enemy of the Freedmen's Bureau in 1866 vetoing an extension to its funding and essentially shutting the organization down former Confederates soon began enforcing the Black Codes through ad hoc violence with some of these Bandit gangs growing so powerful that federal troops had to meet them in pitched battle these protective societies enjoyed immense public support to the point that one such Collective the Ku Klux Klan became a national Scourge with the election of former Confederate Raider Nathan Bedford Forrest as its supreme leader the KKK determined that the ad hoc attacks were not enough Southern blacks had to be reminded of their place through Terror an epidemic of violence erupted with lynchings of black people and white Northerners voter intimidation and public displays of grim pageantry used to deliver a simple message we the white Southerners are still in charge and it will stay that way although the federal government passed laws targeting the KKK and sent troops into southern states to root them out former Confederate soldiers had succeeded in their goals of regaining political power and re-establishing the social mores of the Old South with the end of reconstruction and the withdrawal of federal troops they were able to rebuild their communities and institutions nearly as they had been before the war the impact of their efforts continued to Mark American social and political disputes to this day\",\n",

affairs few presidents seemed to take this advice to Heart Like Woodrow Wilson who commented before his inauguration that it would be ironic if his presidency was concerned mainly with matters abroad President Wilson's remarks would prove prophetic as he was the anti-war isolationist who led the United States into the first world war in this video we will examine how the U.S went from a country that simultaneously declared to neutrality but supplied to the Anton to a major partner in the destruction of the Central Powers for military historians it often isn't enough to Simply read about

description below and start building your own goat guns collection today safe behind its twin moats of the Atlantic and Pacific the United States watched the development of the first world war with concern when hostilities broke out in July of 1914 American ambassador to France Myron T Herrick advocated taking an active role in mediation expression from our nation would have great weight in this crisis a strong plea for delay and moderation from the president of the United States would meet with the respect and approval of Europe President Wilson called for neutrality on an existential level exhorting all Americans to observe neutrality in thought and indeed to this end the government prohibited American Banks from loaning money to any belligerent Nation an act that the then Secretary of State and noted gold hater William Jennings Bryan hoped would both cement American neutrality and bring the war to a speedy conclusion one cannot fight with an empty War chest after all this fiscal neutrality was not long-lived as President Wilson reversed the decision in 1915 in response to the British Empire indicating their stockpiles of cash were about to run out and thus they could not afford to continue buying American Goods though protesting its neutrality at each turn the United States was all too Keen to do business with the Anton with the metaphorical floodgates opened American creditors sent a veritable tsunami of greenbacks to the British Empire who turned right around and spent that money in the United States but the British were not the only foreign Shoppers in American markets as the German Empire too sought to buy critical supplies from Uncle Sam with the Western Front grinding to a stalemate Germany hired ships from neutral countries to Ferry food and other necessities purchased in the United States to the continent but British Naval Supremacy and their blockade of Germany prevented much of it from getting through the United States formally protested the British blockade in March of 1915 but the issue was quietly resolved in a meeting that saw the United States accept a British prohibition on selling food to Germany when the blockade began impacting American cotton exports and threatening a vital pillar of the economy Britain agreed to increase their cotton purchases to cover the shortfall the upshot of all of this economic backroom dealing was an ostensibly neutral United States bowing to any small pressure from the British Empire to stop selling to Germany between 1914 to 1916 American trade with the German Empire plummeted by an economy shattering 99 percent Germany backed to an economic wall ordered a submarine blockade of Great Britain in retaliation the United States protested declaring this to be a violation of international law this double standard accepting a British blockade of Germany but not a German blockade of Britain was acknowledged and waved Away by President Wilson who claimed that the British Navy did not threaten American lives in the same way that Germany's powerful Fleet of submarines did Wilson was unaware that Germany had only nine submarines with which to enforce its blockade hardly the mammoth threat to American life that he seemed to imagine but the threat was still there as the sinking of the Lusitania on March 7 1915 would throw into sharp relief [Music] foreign the sinking of the RMS Lusitania which killed 128 American citizens was only one in a series of incidents that drove the American people further and further into the antonce camp the American public already displeased at reports of German atrocities in Belgium condemned the apparent sinking of a civilian vessel and a diplomatic back and forth between Washington and Berlin ensued calls to enter the war rang in the halls of the capital stopped only by German promises to scale back their submarine operations America was pacified for now but German Americans began to face Prejudice at home Prejudice that would only intensify as the war progressed doubts of German Americans loyalty would be continuously raised with President Wilson declaring that any man who carries a hyphen with him carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this Republic when he gets ready a nakedly hostile remark towards the largest non-english speaking group in the United States at the time government stoked and homegrown paranoia escalated into violence with German Americans shot forced from their homes or lynched such as the case of Robert Paul proger a naturalized citizen who was lynched as a spy in April of 1918. this hatred was further stoked by an incredible Act of sabotage as previously mentioned the Anton funneled much money to Yankee businesses including Munitions plants Germany unable to buy American Weaponry thanks to the British blockade began sending spies to find where the Anton was procuring and transporting weapons and munition and to Halt the flow of materiel if possible one such Point of Departure was black Tom Island in New York Harbor and on July 30th 1916 German agents decided to have a little fireworks show igniting over 20 million dollars worth of stockpile Munitions the Germans created one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in human history a Shockwave equivalent to a magnitude 5 earthquake was felt as far away as Philadelphia the Statue of Liberty was damaged and black Tom Island was devastated 110 by 50 meter crater left behind by the blast momentum was steadily building for the United States to enter the war and in a display of military Acumen that would make Von Bismarck proud German planners determined that the best way to keep the United States from entering Wars was to actively Target their merchant shipping and threaten American lives their rationale was simple bringing back unrestricted submarine warfare and sinking every ship headed to Britain American or not would starve the ontant into submission and end the war before the United States could even be moved to intervene American ships were sunk but President Wilson just barely re-elected continued to demur instead proclaiming armed neutrality by ordering American ships to be armed and authorized to fire on any aggressor as their ships were raided and more were lost the American public began clamoring for more than just armed neutrality President Wilson continued to resist but his efforts were ended by the infamous Zimmerman Telegram an order by the German foreign minister to his men in Mexico to court America's Southern neighbor with Promises of recovering territory in Texas Arizona and New Mexico if they would invade the United States for the Central Powers President Wilson faced with all of these pressures asked his cabinet for advice and found a single word on all of his advisors lips both houses of the United States Congress passed resolutions supporting a war on Germany and President Wilson formally requested Congress acknowledge a state of War had been created by Germany's actions rather than declare war outright Congress responded by declaring war outright on April 6 1917. neutrality had ended and it was time to go over there foreign the United States that entered the first world war was far from a military power isolationism had taken its toll on America's Armed Forces leaving President Wilson to call up a minuscule standing army and dust off a Navy of Aging battleships this in a way suited the president just fine as Wilson believed the simple Act of entering the war would tip the balance of power firmly in the favor of the Anton while the British and French clamored for a fight to the Finish Wilson had his gaze fixed firmly on bringing the Germans to the negotiating table and truly making this the war to end all wars with the passage of The Selective Service Act widespread conscription swelled the Americans numbers two million men had volunteered at the outbreak of war and conscription would see 2.8 million more go over there whether volunteers or conscripts Yankee troops began making their way to Europe American troops landed on European Shores in June of 1917. British and French commanders initially viewed the newly arrived Americans as reinforcements they could use to supplement their dwindling numbers some black soldiers including the famous Harlem Hellfighters were folded into the French army for the duration of the war but General John Blackjack Pershing Infamous pacifier of the Philippines and commander of the American expeditionary Force sought to keep his men together in a unified American Army Pershing would largely get his way and the first major engagement fought by the Americans would come the following summer the Battle of continent a German Salient at the Village of continent represented a golden opportunity to Pershing who committed the first Infantry Division better known as The Big Red One to wipe it out this strike would not only consolidate on taunt Lions but Pershing hoped seeing the Americans in action would boost French confidence in their American comrades at 6 45 am on May 28 1918 American infantry Advanced under cover of French artillery French tanks and flamethrower detachments Advanced alongside the Yanks and the combined Force Advanced up these slopes of Continuum despite the help of the French Gunners tankers and air support the Americans were mauled during the uphill battle yet they succeeded in capturing the village German counter-attacks began not long thereafter but the Americans held firm turning back two days of offensives and keeping a firm grip on Contin the Americans accomplished their objective of not only taking the village but also demonstrating that they could be counted on in a scrap that scrap would come at Bello wood a German offensive punched a hole in French lines and the U.S Marines were sent to plug the Gap pushing back the German assault and repelling numerous attempts to reopen the hole from there the Marines assaulted critical German positions in and around Bellow wood taking heavy casualties but accomplishing their objectives it was among the Trees of Bello that Marine lore could be written Captain Williams refusal to retreat has become the motto of the fifth Marines but Bella Wood and continuity were only the Prelude to the largest offensive and American military history to that point from September 26th to November 11th 1.2 million American troops embarked on the Muse argon offensive aimed at capturing the Railhead at Sudan the offensive hit immediate stumbling blocks as the Americans deployed inexperienced units already weakened by the Spanish Flu as the battle dragged on both the Americans and the French sent troops to shore up the line the Anton Spirits would be lifted by an incredible Act of heroism Corporal Alvin York a sharp shooting infantryman from the 82nd infantry now the 82nd Airborne killed 25 and captured 132 Germans a feat that would earn him the Medal of Honor in a bid to break the stalemate The Big Red One assaulted the German stronghold at Cote du ChatOn an imposing position that American Lieutenant General Robert Bullard described thus not a line a net four kilometers deep wire interlaced knee-high and grass wire Tangled devilishly in forests pillboxes in succession one covering another no Foxhole cover for Gunners here but concrete masonry bits of trenches more wire a few light guns defense in depth the mighty first was repulsed by this net but their loss was quickly Avenged by your friend and mine Douglas MacArthur of the 42nd Rainbow division a patchwork of National Guard troops from States from Iowa to Alabama the Guardsmen were able to succeed where the Big Red One failed cracking quotes du chattion and turning the tide of the offensive just in time for the Armistice to be signed on November 11th America would prove as active in peace as they were in the final days of the war President Wilson brought his 14 points to the negotiations at Versailles and pushed for these principles to provide the Bedrock for the post-war World Wilson envisioned A League of Nations that would promote Global Peace and provide a diplomatic alternative to fighting Wilson also sought to impose his peaceableness on Europe as a whole dismantling the Old Colonial system and promoting self-determination for All Peoples across the world but Wilson's ideas were not universally accepted with the previously mentioned Secretary of State Lansing remarking that promoting self-determination would raise hopes which can never be realized and that the phrase is simply loaded with dynamite the British and French were equally skeptical with the French representative only reading Wilson's points when the German delegation requested that they be the basis of the peace talks fearing that the Americans and Germans would conclude a separate piece based on Wilson's ideas the French and British accepted the 14 points as Germany requested Wilson became quite popular for his peacemaking image and his League of Nations was formally established in 1920 but neither the Treaty of Versailles which ended the first world war nor the United States entry into the League of Nations were approved by Congress a sign that isolationism had returned to America's Shores America's war was over for now participation in the war to end all wars brought America onto the world stage in an unprecedented fashion but the Public's desire to return to a quiet isolation dashed any hopes that President Wilson had of his country leading the world into a new era of peace and international cooperation the League of Nations would go on to crumble under the weight of its members indifference to its decisions specifically the open Defiance of the Japanese empire in the 1930s German Americans came out of the war brow beaten into hiding their culture and assimilating while before the war a full quarter of American High School students studied the German language by 1918 only one percent of high schools even had German offered as a class ultimately it would take another world war and a new president to see Lady Liberty take the center stage in world affairs again [Music] [Music] thank you\",\n",

runs prayer beads through his fingers another salvo from the battleships surely nothing could have survived the bombardment the boat's helsman calls out time to go ashore the landing ramp collides with a concrete sea wall fragments of a ladder falling imply into the passenger bay the americans scramble out of the boat scaling the concrete as their enemy opens fire but it is not the chatter of an mg-42 that greets these united states marines but the slow chug of a soviet machine gun this is incheon south korea and like the normandy landings barely six years before this amphibious invasion will turn the tide of a war hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian the seeds that would grow into the korean war were sown in 1945 when the soviet red army invaded the peninsula following its declaration of war on imperial japan which had held korea since 1910 soviet forces advanced down the peninsula until they reached the 38th parallel then halted while the u.s troops landed in the south and moved to meet them splitting the peninsula in two the soviets established a communist provisional government in the north elevating kim il-sung a hero of the insurgency against japan to the head of government consolidating power sung declared the formation of the democratic people's republic of korea espousing democratic socialism but practicing brutal authoritarianism with north korea lost to communism the americans decided to push back by establishing the first republic of korea but this state was hardly a bastion of liberty and democracy if you're a regular viewer you no doubt enjoy

korea's first experience with democracy bore a disappointing resemblance to affairs in the dprk when elections were held in july of 1948 u.s backed candidate sigmund re just barely made it over the threshold with an entirely unsuspicious 92.6 percent of the popular vote both rei's administration in the south and song's administration in the north wanted nothing more than to reunite the two halves of the peninsula under their respective governments making conflict between north and south inevitable re declared his intent to reconquer the north to american envoys and followed up his statements with a soviet-style purge of ideological opponents including the chechu uprising by communist elements which led to between thirty thousand and sixty thousand casualties ree's roughshod approach caused his american backers to limit their investment in what they saw more akin to a diet democracy than a truly free state even if re had gotten his war american support would have been hard to come by the readiness of america's ground forces had dropped precipitously and by 1950 of the 10 combat divisions in the united states army only one the 82nd airborne was considered combat ready all u.s forces had also been evacuated in late 1949 leaving the south defended exclusively by the republic of korea army or rok army observing this weakness kim il-sung began to believe that he could rapidly invade and conquer south korea eventually song launched his invasion but claimed to his dying day that it was a righteous response to a surprise attack from the south which was conveniently defeated so decisively by the korean people's army that no evidence of the invaders was left meanwhile in his memoirs nikita khrushchev stated i must stress that the war wasn't stalin's idea but kim il-sung's kim was the initiator stalin of course didn't try to dissuade him the korean war was a very unique kind of proxy war where the larger us and ussr were mostly against a conflict that their clients in korea were all too keen to initiate and initiate what they did in the early hours of june 25th 1950 the korean people's army or kpa crossed the 38th parallel with an armored spearhead of 150 t-3485 rapidly pushing the rok army back towards seoul and capturing both kaesong and oijeongbu yet despite the dire situation it was late evening before news reached the secretary of defense who begrudgingly woke up long enough to leave orders for general douglas macarthur to investigate rumors of a disturbance along the 38th parallel before going back to sleep while he slumbered the rock army chief of staff chai pyeongduk was seemingly busy doing his best to lose the war as quickly as possible thanks to multiple communication failures his counter-attack with the second and seventh divisions east of oijongbu broke down in confusion the isolated first division put up fierce resistance but with limited anti-tank weaponry they could do little against the horde of t-34s with retreat as the only reasonable course of action general che instead ordered his troops to hold fast soon the first division was alone fighting a doomed last stand as the static south korean positions were systematically president reed then fled seoul and just two days after the invasion began the capital fell to the kpa general macarthur then ordered the commander of the eighth u.s army lieutenant general walton walker to prepare all available forces in the far east and immediately dispatch them to south korea this turned out to be a depressingly tiny force consisting of only the 24th infantry division armed with a charmingly vintage arsenal dating back from the second world war even worse only six transport planes were available which could carry a single battalion this battalion was designated task force smith and was quickly launched to secure the vital port of busan at dawn on july 5th task force smith engaged the kpa for the first time at the battle of osan but their equipment proved useless against kpa tanks and they were quickly overwhelmed however they did hold just long enough for the bulk of the 24th infantry division to secure busan unfortunately all other actions the 24th participated in afterward were abject failures and the unit eventually sustained over 6 000 casualties including its commander but these sacrifices bought time for the united states to mobilize its full military might within days america had established total air and naval superiority the korean sky constantly filled with withering bombing raids on both the invading army and north korean infrastructure yet kim il-sung refused to back down and on august 4th the kpa launched an all-out assault on the perimeter around busan the kpa found the americans well dug in and the assault morphed into a protracted battle of attrition but the perimeter came close to collapse on august 15th when a push across the naktong river by the kpa's elite troops managed to carve a salient known as the naktong bridge only the timely arrival of reinforcements averted disaster all while american air and naval assets kept the north koreans from consolidating their gains as they proceeded to devastate kpa supply lines while the battle for busan raged on general macarthur was busy coordinating an amphibious landing at incheon a hundred miles or 160 kilometers behind enemy lines when told that inchon was heavily defended and that adverse sea conditions made any landing a daunting prospect anyway macarthur responded thusly the very arguments you have made as to the impractic abilities involved will tend to ensure for me the element of surprise for the north korean commander will reason that no one would be so brash as to make such an attempt being so brash macarthur got the plan approved in late august and to everyone's surprise the landing at inchon proved a massive success this forced the kpa to pull forces away from busan allowing the defenders to stage a breakout on the 25th this was the last straw for the north koreans and their morale finally shattered with hundreds of soldiers surrendering on mass as the americans drove north and attracted the attention of chinese border troops at the yalu river with incheon secured u.n forces began their drive to liberate seoul the road to seoul was a grueling campaign which saw intense combat around airfields and strong points flamethrowers and massive bombardments played a key role in dislodging stubborn kpa troops the fighting only worsened when u.n troops met the kpa in the second battle of seoul brutal house-to-house combat saw thousands of kpa soldiers killed while american casualties hovered close to 300. un forces ultimately seized the city on september 28th the invasion of south korea had been defeated not just by american forces but by a coalition including thai ethiopian british canadian and dutch soldiers coming together for a truly international response morale was high victory was sweet and with your friend and mind douglas macarthur leading the charge the thought on the ground was what could go possibly wrong with south korea secured macarthur and his superiors were left debating whether or not to go for a killing blow against kim il-sung's regime singman re was still determined to reunite the peninsula under his rule and the men on the ground were eager to take revenge on the north for the casualties they had suffered during the brutal fighting around busan and the nakhdang river ultimately the joint chiefs authorized macarthur to invade north korea as long as such operations had a reasonable chance of success as the americans rested on their laurels and planned for their invasion of north korea the people's republic of china moved troops closer to north korea ultimately assembling a force of almost half a million men at the yalu river after the intense battles in the south pyongyang fell with astonishing ease the dispirited kpa offered virtually no resistance and the capital was taken on october 19th the u.s joint chiefs of staff ordered macarthur to prepare the way for unification of a free and independent korea unaware that u.n success had awakened a sleeping giant the people's republic of china china had watched the korean war with concern concerned that only grew as their ideological brethren in the north were routed by the capitalist forces the same day pyongyang was captured 300 000 soldiers of the people's army led by veterans of the chinese civil war crossed the border into korean territory and a whole new phase of the conflict began the first chinese offensive began on october 25th with an easy victory at the battle of unson but the people's army did not press its advantage withdrawing quickly back into the mountains then just a week after the first offensive the north korean winter set in with temperatures dropping to -8 degrees fahrenheit or minus 22 degrees celsius accompanied by howling gales in spite of these appalling conditions macarthur insisted that the offensive continue but the second encounter with the chinese at the changshan river on november 25th was a disaster with the rock second corps being wiped out and the us 8th army being thrown into a disorderly route then on the 27th the 30 000 strong us 10th corps was encircled by over 120 000 chinese soldiers near the chosan reservoir for 17 days the americans fought desperately to escape the trap before finally breaking out to the port of hangnam where they were evacuated the survivors were dubbed the chosen few in a bitter play on words chosan reservoir was a horrendous battle with chinese forces regularly offering no quarter to their american adversaries left with no choice the u.n coalition was forced to go on the defensive and pyongyang was abandoned on the 5th of december the rapid retreat saw both u.n forces and korean civilians withdraw before the chinese advance and the journey south was fraught with accidents and tragedies including the death of general walker commander of all u.s army forces in korea only a personal visit to the troops by walker's successor general matthew b ridgeway for stalled outright panic even so there was nothing the coalition could do to stop the enemy advance and in january seven chinese armies washed over seoul forcing the defenders to retreat and soul changed hands for the third time relief for the shell-shocked defenders only came when the chinese supply lines were broken by u.s air power forcing them to begin a slow withdrawal back to the 38th parallel the un's fortunes had well and truly turned yet general macarthur remained convinced that victory was possible and even pressured president truman to authorize the use of nuclear weapons on korean soil after weeks of enduring this insubordinate behavior truman sacked macarthur and promoted general ridgway in his place meanwhile the chinese were experiencing issues of their own coalition air superiority remained absolute and north korea now resembled a moonscape of craters from ceaseless u.s bomber attacks ridgeway undertook several initiatives in his new position operation wolfhound saw a massive air reconnaissance effort revealed the people's army were holding their positions if not withdrawing and ridgeway capitalized on this information to launch operation thunderbolt a new drive toward seoul thunderbolt brought the un forces to the city but the daring offensive operation ripper saw the capital change hands for the fourth and final time from this point on ridgeway and the un forces doubled down on their philosophy of overwhelming firepower leveraging superior american military technology to level the playing field with the overwhelming numbers of the people's army ridgeway became focused on destroying the chinese rather than retaking north korea but the war devolved into a stalemate of attrition with salience developing in the shifting lines and hardpoints like porkchop hill and white horse mountain changing hands in bloody tugs of war superior firepower or not the people's army was still in the fight and the us joint chiefs estimated that a renewed march on pyongyang would result in a minimum of 200 000 u.s casualties an utterly unthinkable price for the war-weary american public to be asked to pay as the u.n troops duked it out with the chinese politicians in washington began to push for a settlement they saw little chance of ending the conflict any other way peace talks began in mid-1951 while ridgway and his cohorts continued to battle the chinese but neither side wanted to risk admitting defeat fearful of the reaction from both their government and their constituents belligerent diplomats and petty cultural misunderstandings caused negotiations to stall on multiple occasions as a result there was also the thorny issue of pows over 60 000 korean and chinese prisoners refused repatriation preferring to stay in the south this would result in much bickering between the two sides dragging matters on for over a year until a ceasefire agreement was finally agreed on on july 27 1953 the deal established a demilitarized zone at the 38th parallel and set up a neutral nations repatriation commission to settle the ongoing pow issue sigmund re naturally refused to sign the agreement and officially north and south korea are still at war to this very day when all was said and done the status quo came at the cost of three million lives most of whom were civilians both sides committed a number of massacres but the united states denied their own war crimes in korea for many years while publicizing the brutality of their enemies from 2005 to 2010 a south korean commission conducted a large-scale investigation of war crimes concluding that 82 percent were perpetrated by south korean forces with 18 perpetrated by north korean forces many were motivated by fears of communist insurgents hiding among civilian populations like its cold war cousin the vietnam war the korean war was a long bloody and ultimately futile conflict the only difference was that the u.s succeeded in forgetting korea [Music]\",\n",

saw hundreds of thousands of troops committed to an invasion that ended with the deposition of a dictator while we will cover some of the political background and context of this much discussed conflict this video will primarily focus on the combat maneuvers and objectives of the momentous invasion that sparked an eight-year occupation and insurgency but first if you haven't had the chance to check out our video on the first iraq war here is a quick recap after it ended with iraqi forces being expelled from kuwait the u.s soldiers sought to protect kurdish and shiite minorities in iraq by enforcing no-fly zones and launching airstrikes against strategic sites such as oil fields and military bases but following saddam hussein's repeated refusal to cooperate with un weapon inspectors the united states passed the iraqi liberation act which officially solidified the goal of regime change in the country at the time though this act simply consisted of providing millions of dollars to numerous opposition groups in the country with the hope of toppling saddam's government in late 2002 the united states began building a case against the baathist government of iraq and sought the support of the u.n security council on top of the claimed ties to al-qaeda the bush administration had a laundry list of justifications for armed intervention including the mistreatment of civilians and the aforementioned expulsion of un weapons inspectors perhaps for seeing how controversial these accusations would be in the future many in the un security council strenuously objected to the proposed invasion insisting that america pursue a diplomatic solution instead but even while the council debated cia teams were landing in iraq to lay the groundwork for a full-scale invasion the u.s had already made up its mind saddam's regime was doomed moving quickly members of the special activities division established contact with the kurdish peshmergas who opposed saddam then they began identifying key elements of iraqi leadership this intelligence would be used to devastating effect in the opening days of the conflict with surgical airstrikes killing many high-ranking officers additionally the special activities division captured a chemical weapons factory yet despite secretary of state colin powell's vivid descriptions of mobile weapons laboratories on the backs of trucks and train cars the facility was the only one of its kind found during the entire iraq war unsurprisingly these preemptive strikes did not help america's case to the u.n which continued to call for de-escalation key nato members such as france and canada were also highly vocal in condemning america's aggression opposition around the world mounted culminating with the largest recorded protest in human history when on february 15 2003 over 6 million people in 800 cities gathered to protest the war nevertheless in march of 2003 the united states and the coalition of the willing which included the united kingdom poland and australia among others began massing troops in the region unlike the war fought 12 years earlier they would be advancing without un approval the invasion began slowly the first phase consisted of numerous air strikes and covert raids on targets within the country with varying degrees of success one of the first of these was the battle of al qaeda on march 17th when units of the british special air service attacked a suspected chemical weapons site housed in a water treatment facility near the syrian border but the iraqi defenders put up an unexpectedly spirited defense and the commando team was forced to withdraw under heavy fire frustrated they called in an airstrike leveling the entire facility and obliterating any potential evidence that chemical weapons were being held in the facility another strike occurred two days later at a community just outside baghdad called dura farms believing that saddam was visiting his sons in the area the united states saturated the area with 8 000 pounds of ordnance and 40 tomahawk cruise missiles in an attempt to wipe the iraqi dictator off the face of the earth however every single satellite-guided warhead missed its target and as a result over a dozen civilians were injured and one killed to complete the debacle it was later discovered that saddam's last visit to the area had been nearly a decade ago despite these issues the main invasion was finally getting underway based on the precedent set in the first gulf war and afghanistan most observers had expected a lengthy period of aerial bombardment before any ground offensive however the coalition instead opted to launch a rapid air and ground campaign that would avoid most urban areas and focus on decapitating the iraqi government this tactic later called shock and awe was chosen for two reasons first american leaders assumed that if the command structure was eliminated organized resistance would disintegrate second it was hoped that the civilian population would support the americans as liberators secretary of defense donald rumsfeld was particularly optimistic about this stating there will be iraqis who offer not only to help us but to help liberate the country and free the iraqi people as we will see this wasn't totally the case on the night of march 19th members of the 160th airborne known as the nightstalkers destroyed more than 70 iraqi military outposts along the southern and western borders with the path cleared coalition forces advanced from kuwait in two prongs one directed north and one south a combined air and amphibious assault was also launched on the alpha peninsula on march 20th with the goal of securing the critical oil infrastructure located there american british and polish commandos all worked tirelessly to capture the offshore platforms before they could be sabotaged by the defenders despite significant resistance from entrenched iraqis supported by artillery fire the teams were able to secure the peninsula after a grueling three-day battle their efforts likely prevented a major ecological disaster and saved billions of dollars worth of equipment that saddam would otherwise have destroyed in a petty act of revenge unfortunately for the coalition this would be the last bit of good pr they would receive for quite some time as we'll see in the part 2 which is out right now the war for iraq was just beginning and even this initial taste of victory had been soured by the clumsy handling of al-qaeda and the disaster at dura farms while coalition casualties remained minimal intelligence failures would continue to plague future operations muddying the overall picture of the war in iraq to such an extent that many details remain unclear to this day thanks to blinkist for

Second World War [Music] when we last left off the desert fox was on the run in November 1942 her win Rommel and his forces escaped capture at the hands of Bernard Montgomery's 8th army he was outgunned and out matched but not out of the fight the last two months of the year would prove to be dramatic as would the next on November 8th 1942 more than a hundred thousand Allied troops landed at three points in Morocco and Algeria arriving to the rear of Rommels embattled Africa Corps the landing sites Casablanca Oran and Algiers were themselves a compromise between two very different visions on the part of American and British planners Winston Churchill's government had favored a more spread out large-scale deployment all over the Mediterranean coast of North Africa Americans on the other hand were still concerned about the loyalties of the Vichy French forces in the area perhaps more significantly Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Joint Chiefs feared the possibility that such a large movement in the western Mediterranean would provoke a response from nationalist Spain which had been nominally neutral so far but had a strong affinity for the Axis powers ultimately supreme Allied commander Dwight Eisenhower decided on a happy medium Operation Torch included three prongs which would reach into the Mediterranean but only as far as Algiers the Western task force was entirely made up of 30,000 American men and was led by George S Patton in their landing at Casablanca the center task force was made up of 13 9,000 American ground troops but with a British naval escort who landed in Iran Algeria lastly the eastern task force made up of 10,000 Americans and 23,000 British troops was also protected by the British Navy on its way to Algiers altogether the force involved in Operation Torch called the British first Army despite its heterogeneous makeup was more than a hundred thousand strong and led by British general Kenneth Anderson when they arrived on November 8th the disposition of Vichy forces in the area was largely still a mystery as military historian Brian Lane header explains French officers loyalty to the Vichy regime varied the Nazis were generally disliked - despised but seemingly non-stop British and American military disasters partly inspired confidence in defying the bare mocked though the Allies were uncertain of Vichy France's Allegiance US General Mark Clark met with Charles mast Resident General of France in Tunisia before the invasion as part of an extended campaign of subterfuge designed to garner French support in North Africa however the secret of Clark offered scant on details of Operation Torch many of the French troops stationed in the area had no idea what was coming when American and British troops set foot in French North Africa the Karason forces were so confused and hesitant that they did not resist the landings they did however put up stiff resistance at the cities of Casablanca and on this miscommunication was almost fatal to the operation since they had not expected meaningful resistance there had been no naval or aerial bombing in advance of the attack and it looked like the center and Western task forces were in trouble Eastern task force on the other hand had little difficulty ceasing Algiers which they did the same day they landed charles mast commanded the french in this and ordered his men to stand down with the tentative approval of his superior Admiral Francois Berlin the Admiral a notorious Nazi collaborator and deputy leader of the country was an opportunist above all and had hinted he would be willing to defect to the Allies seeing which way the winds were blowing he ordered a ceasefire first in algiers and then in north africa generally with basically no authority to do so Darla's negotiated a nominal cooperation agreement with the Allies on November 13th called the darlana agreement allowing for the use of civilian infrastructure as well as actual military support up north Hitler stopped pretending to respect French sovereignty and invaded the free zone that had remained unoccupied after the fall of France in 1940 on November 9th German reinforcements began flying in from their newly captured airfields into Tunisia by the end of the month the German soldiers in the country numbered 15,000 bolstered by another 9,000 Italians who arrived by Road from Tripoli both allied and Axis armies wanted to reach Tunis and fortify at first making the situation even more urgent was the coming Tunisian wet season heavy rains would likely mean impassable roads and perhaps more than a month of safety for whoever occupied the capital city when they began the war in northwest Africa was a race against time logistical delays meant that Kenneth Anderson could only begin the offensive on November 25th 1942 they advanced quickly along the coastal road but were checked around desert ten days later by the fifth Panzer Army among the reinforcements the 5th army had received were a handful of the cutting-edge Panzer 6 tiger tanks for when general Juergen von Arnim arrived on December 9th to take control of all Axis forces in Tunisia he had some of Nazi Germany's newest toys with him with these and his other assets von Arnim was able to expand his defensive position in Bizet and tunis into one larger defensive line from this strengthened position he was able to fend off Anderson's Christmas Eve offensive just as the infamous Tunisian downpours began operation torch had ground to a halt as 1942 came to an end the Germans and Italians would be able to defend their new perimeter in the new year but that tactical victory came at a strategic cost tanks and Men sent to Tunisia were desperately needed elsewhere especially against the Soviets in the east in early January Rommels retreating Africa Corps arrived in southeast Tunisia still on the run from Bernard Montgomery's Eighth Army knowing that he was seriously outnumbered and outmaneuvered by the two-pronged Allied advance he would take advantage of his ability to move more quickly within a constrained space to attack multiple points in quick succession leaving a partial force at the old French Mareth line he decided to attack the Western first Army while first aiming to drive them back through the narrow passes between the Atlas Mountains near Gafsa the assault saw reasonable success after a few probing attacks the true assault came on February 14th when the 21st Panzer Division attacked the u.s. 2nd corps destroying a hundred American tanks near sidi bouzid Rommel urged the division commander to continue the attack after his initial success but he waited another day for authorization from von Arnim who was technically in charge they pushed the Americans back 50 miles to Kasserine pass where they put up a stubborn resistance that lasted for five days meanwhile Rommel himself peeled off and captured an allied air field at telepathy On February 17th Rommel hoped to then push north - to besa an American logistical Nexus but Arnhem was unwilling to commit to such an aggressive instead on February 19th he was ordered to attack Northwest at tala instead just where Anderson was expecting when the axis finally punched through Kasserine on February 20th Anderson was ready with reinforcements and ground attack aircraft that beat Rommel back two days later having lost the momentum of his final assault and facing renewed allied strength Rommel was on the verge of defeat in North Africa and as it turned out attacking the Western pronged first may have been a grave miscalculation Montgomery's Eighth Army had been strung out in its pursuit and only one division faced the Mareth line On February 26 when Rommel attacked ten days later its strength had quadrupled having finally learned the utility of anti-tank guns in the field the British chewed right through Rommels forces and repelled his attack it was around this time that the desert fox allegedly dealing with serious illness was recalled to Europe it was an ignoble end to the famous generals campaign von Arnim was left in the unenviable position of picking up where Rommel had left off on March 17th George Patton's 2nd Corps tried to cut off the Africa Corps retreating along the coast to Tunis but their attack was ultimately parried in the mountain passes nonetheless the danger of such a development was established three days later the bulk of the Eighth Army began a more direct assault on the American while new New Zealand Corps made a wide flanking maneuver and assaulted from the rear near al Hama the frontal assault ultimately failed to completely punch through the line so Montgomery began shifting attention to the flank on March 23rd facing the prospect of encirclement the Germans and Italians began quickly retreating their defense at al Hama lasted long enough for most of the Africa Corps to escape before the Allies finally breached the line on March 28th on April 11th all axis elements had joined together in the northeastern portion of Tunisia you might think that the reasonable strategic decision at this point would be to pull your forces out of the theater to better defend Europe you'd be right but that's not what the axis did instead they demanded von Arnim defend a mile perimeter around Bazaar and Tunis by the end of April 1943 axes defenses in the region were being strained to the limit after steady allied advances a relative calm took hold for the next two weeks except to the northwest where Americans and a French North African Corps were able to reach within 20 miles of desert during this period anderson redeployed his forces in preparation for one final strike from the north using dummy tanks and other decoys to trick von Arnim into assuming the attack would instead come from the South overnight on Wednesday May 5th the 4th indian and 4th british infantry divisions broke through the German perimeter after an intensive aerial and artillery bombardment clearing the way for the 6th and 7th armored divisions though the British forces had only advanced about five miles closer to the city axis defenders could no longer effectively maneuver in their defence during the evening on Saturday the British entered Tunis while almost simultaneously the Americans and French broke into Bizet the formal surrender of Axis forces in the area resulting in as many as 250,000 prisoners wouldn't come until the next week finally bringing the war in that theatre to an end when all was said and done the worst fears of the German High Command had been realized in pursuit of Mussolini's new roman empire they had overextended themselves while forces were desperately needed elsewhere the North African campaign was a war of attrition and after three and a half years it was clear that the logistical apparatus of the Allies had decisively outmatched its axis counterpart Rommel strategic mind was undoubtedly gifted but so were those of his adversaries many of the Allied leaders that had cornered the desert fox would serve in the allied invasion of Sicily and the Normandy landings within the next two years Stephen W Sears writes this for some North Africa was the first step on the road to military fame Eisenhower became supreme commander of Allied forces in Europe with Montgomery the head of ground forces but for others the desert war was the climax of their military careers Wavell and Auchinleck later served in relative obscurity in the Far East General Ricci ended up as a poor commander in Europe under Montgomery for Irwin Rommel the future brought only disillusionment and doom in July 1944 a group of generals tried to kill the Fuhrer by planting a bomb in his headquarters Rommel took no part in it however he did not know that the conspirators plan to name him head of state if they succeeded but Hitler survived and in the purge that followed Rommel was implicated they

pushed ax's forces west along the north african coast hoping to finally capture the elusive irwin rammel at betta falm instead he once again escaped and dug in at el a gala where the brits presumed he would assume a defensive posture general claude auchenlack believed that rommel's forces were too depleted by the events of the previous year to launch a meaningful counter-attack he and his staff had badly miscalculated on january 21 1942 the germans launched a punishing counter-attack that pushed the british 8th army out of almost all of the territory that they had recaptured as part of operation crusader during the first weeks of february axis forces swept east through cerenaica while the british retreated again and again on february 6 the front lines finally stabilized some 60 kilometers west of to brook as rommel was once again hamstrung by his need for reinforcements the eighth army under the command of lieutenant general neil richie who my artist just still hasn't had enough time to draw formed a defensive line from the gezawa inlet in the north to ber hakim the awk under strong pressure from prime minister winston churchill ordered richie to attack however our favorite stick figure was worried that the axis forces would again sweep south of any new incursion as a compromise the plan for the upcoming operation buckshot called for reserve units to be positioned to the center and south behind a leading force before it could even begin however richie was proven right on the evening of may 26th the africa corps 21st panzer 15th panzer and 90th light infantry divisions swung south while four italian divisions remained to oppose the gaza line the attacking force annihilated richie's reserve units but in a turn of events that should surprise absolutely nobody who's been watching this series insufficient fuel and ammunition once again stifled formal's attack unable to finish their march to the sea the now isolated axis divisions took a defensive position at a location they called the cauldron on may 29th during the first week of june the allies launched air and groud assaults against the cauldron for a moment it seemed like rommel might be encircled but on june 1st his panzers managed to break through to their west and reunite with the remaining italians watching the gazala line crumble richie ordered the 13th and 30th court to retreat to egypt leaving only the thousand man second south african division at to brooke once again the allies fled east and once again the port city was in the crosshairs of the desert fox in order to capture that vital port which had so long eluded him rommel knew he would need a formidable supply of both fuel and ammunition his hungry gaze fell upon the allied airfield at camphurt where the raf had been dropping supplies for british ground forces that proverbial henhouse stored all of the eggs he could ever won bolstered by what he had taken at the raf supply drop ramo attacked the city once again on the evening of the 20th this time rather than nine months the siege lasted barely a day it was the worst british military defeat since the fall of singapore and was seen as especially humiliating due to the speed with which it was obtained in recognition of his foresight before the battle of gezalla we at the armchair historian team have finally commissioned a portrait of neil richie and in recognition of his defeat the awk fired him maybe we shouldn't have invested in his portrait after all the awk took direct control of the 8th army on the 25th but couldn't stop the africa corps from sweeping aside the defenders at mrsa matra with the resupply depot at to brooke finally in hand it seemed that axis forces were on the cusp of victory and for his victory at to brooke rommel was promoted to field marshal cairo the center of power in the region since the day of the romans was barely 200 miles away the suez canal the all-important jugular vein of the british empire was within striking distance all that remained in the way was a little railroad station by the sea called el alamein and the battered british army defending it the new field marshal saw no reason to let this impediment stand possibly riding the high of his incredible successes rommel either overestimated the resilience of his own forces or underestimated that of the defenders his exhausted men were moving towards the end of their newly extended supply lines moreover finally learning from the german's use of the 88 millimeter anti-aircraft cannon to punch through tanks at long range the british defenders mustered a massive artillery barrage from every gun available rommel's tanks were especially vulnerable to this bombardment because they had been channeled into a narrow corridor between the sea and the katara depression an area of desert with especially difficult terrain that made it impassable for mechanized forces fighting was intense but ultimately the allied position held at the cost of more than thirteen thousand lives the ninth australian division counter-attacked following the artillery bombardment and pushed the germans back securing the awk his last victory in the desert campaign but the prime minister had become impatient with the ox suggested timetable for offensive operations which were set to begin in early september this was likely due in part to churchill's knowledge that a new front was about to open up in west africa without a swift victory in egypt and libya the planned invasion might face disaster during a handful of meetings in london that july plans for operation torch a massive anglo-american landing in northwest africa had been finalized fearing that any hesitation might jeopardize the plan the prime minister sacked the dawdling awk as commander-in-chief for the middle east and acting commander of the 8th army taking his place as second in command in the middle east was general harold alexander who had commanded the first corps at dunkirk for command of the eighth army bernard al montgomery was chosen there will be no more bellyaching and no more retreats he intended to go on the attack but ironically the meticulous general spent even more time preparing than the awk had requested that left the ball in rommel's court but when he again tried to break through on the night of august 30th this time at alum el halfa ridge the africa corps was met with heavy minefields and air attacks on september 2nd with fuel yet again being the limited factor axis forces retreated once more the field marshal's seemingly unstoppable advance had well and truly stumbled for the next seven weeks montgomery gathered strength and reinforcements when he launched a massive attack on october 23rd he had 1230 medium tanks ready to be deployed rommel was down to just 210. of the allied tanks 500 were new american sherman and grant tanks as good or better than anything the axis had except the panzer iv of which rommel had only 23. the offensive was costly and the artillery fire tore tanks apart on both sides but montgomery was able to slowly wedge the 8th army into the german italian position landmines that rommel had planted to his rear and the anti-tank guns that now surrounded the british on three sides meant that the desert fox was killing four tanks for every one that he lost nonetheless his enemies numerical and logistical advantage was overwhelming by the evening of november 2nd the africa corps had just 30 tanks in operating condition when the field marshal signaled a retreat adolf hitler was furious he told rommel to hold his position at all costs but the battle was lost and the fuhrer's anger wouldn't change that the hurried withdrawal left the allies in a favorable position the italian divisions

       " \" hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian today's video the north african campaign part two [Music] on february 12 1941 a 50 year old renowned tank commander and veteran of the first world war stepped off of a german transport plane into the arid desert air this man was none other than irwin rommel relatively short with a solemn look he was the son and grandson of schoolteachers and he looked the part or perhaps more like the principal however this man who would come to be called the desert fox was not just a scholar of infantry tactics he was one of germany's most well-respected battlefield tacticians his image has been somewhat sanitized by both wartime and post-war propaganda and so it is worth remembering that rommel was one of adolf hitler's personal favorites he was here on behalf of the fuhrer to clean up mussolini's mess during our research for this episode we found the full english translation of erwin rommel's 1937 military classic infantry

onwards to africa operation compass the code name for the first allied military operation of the western desert campaign had been an enormous success for the british thanks to general sir archibald weivel and his subordinate richard o'connor however the allies winning streak was about to come to an end on february 9 winston churchill ordered the sixth australian division to cross the mediterranean and join the allied defense of greece at nearly the same moment that germany's newly created africa corps began deploying in libya since the british did not expect a counter-attack in libya most of the 7th armored division returned to egypt to defend her majesty's holdings there as a result when erwin ramo arrived with 65 000 german troops in addition to the 55 000 italians already present he was able to bring a 120 000 man hammer down on the dangerously strung out allies in the entirety of the middle east theater wavel had around 118 000 men under his command as part of the newly reformed 8th army they were supported by a large quantity of aircraft and the superior british navy however the british forces over extension meant that they were unprepared for the concentrated axis assault despite ramos orders to take a defensive stance until more reinforcements arrived in may of 1941 the ambitious commander took action after remarkably easy early offensive victories at al aguilar and merced brega before long he put the german plans for operation zone bloomer or sunflower into action early our historian friend from the last episode stephen w sears notes that the army that faced rommel was not the fast-moving quick thinking force that had chased marshall graziani out of egypt the desert rats of the seventh armored division had been replaced by the newly arrived second armored division and the sixth australian division was relieved by another australian division untrained and poorly equipped like o'connor did before him rommel split his forces in an attempt to cut the enemy off ordering some troops to take the coastal route and ordering others to go through cerenaica as for o'connor himself in an almost inconceivable blunder the british officer's unescorted staff car took a wrong turn and drove right into axis forces he and his intended replacement philip neem along with john coombe the man who ambushed the retreating italian army in 1940 were captured and wevel was down three of his most experienced senior officers by mid-april benghazi had fallen and nearly all of the british forces in libya had been successfully pushed back to egypt with one notable exception those at brook this fortified position was held by the remnants of the australian 9th and 7th divisions along with several divisions of english and commonwealth artillery who had fled there during rommel's initial advance one of the recurring themes in this series is the difficulty of keeping troops supplied in a huge desert battlefield like north africa to quote steven sears once more as marshall graziani had ruefully noted desert war imposed its own special rules rule number one was that armies brought with them everything they needed there was no such thing as living off the country rama would need to brook as a resupply port to have any chance of pushing into egypt thus began a seemingly endless siege of the isolated allied position surrounded on three sides the 23 000 manned garrison was assisted and supplied by the royal navy but lacked air support becoming the frequent target of luftwaffe raids the germans and italians sent wave after wave of troops against the australians but the defenses of dubrook had been bolstered into a fortress royal engineers created a 30-mile semi-circle of trenches and hardened defensive structures peppered in were lengths of barbed wire tank traps and land mines without the reinforcements it seemed that rommel would not be able to root out the troublesome aussies on his flank and would have to be content with containing them spring saw numerous advances on either side that were quickly repelled first among them was the aptly named operation brevity which only lasted from may 15th to the 16th british forces made slight gains that were nearly immediately undone by axis counter-attacks those incursions culminated with axis forces seizing the choke point at hellfire pass on may 26th and the 27th but were unable to move any further as summer was nearing wavel received reinforcements as part of another operation codenamed tiger a daring mission that saw 238 tanks ferried across the mediterranean in relatively slow vulnerable merchant ships protected by a royal navy escort to be fair to wavel as supreme commander of all british forces in the middle east his troops had to contend not just with ramos africa corps but also with the remaining italians in east africa local rebellions in their oil-rich colonial holdings in iraq and the threat of axis troops landing in vichy french syria and lebanon what's more he was also responsible for overseeing the key allied defensive positions in the mediterranean such as crete and malta if the desert campaign really was the game of chess contemporary military strategists thought it was huevel was playing three games at once against three different opponents on june 15th huevo launched operation battle axe a british and indian offensive intended to push the german forces out of halfaya pass with the ultimate goal of relieving to brook and it proved no more successful than past attempts and was called off after just two days the frustrated churchill relieved wavel three weeks later and replaced him with the commander-in-chief of india clawed the awk akanlak on july 5th sears notes from the failure of battle axe the british concluded that their tanks were outgunned by those of the enemy when in most cases the actual killers were the anti-tank guns particularly the 88 flag the failure to appreciate the full value of the anti-tank gun was to haunt the british in months to come the awk spent the next few months resupplying and regrouping while rommel tried in vain to overwhelm the australian garrison into brook the aussies had no problem standing their ground presumably because everything back home in australia tries to kill you anyways the royal navy continued to resupply them under the cover of darkness and in september they were successfully rotated out of the city taking their place was the british 70th division the polish carpathian brigade and the czechoslovak 11th infantry battalion this mixed allied force would hold the city for the rest of the siege in november british reinforcements joined with those from india sudan south africa and new zealand swelling the aux forces and prompting him to initiate operation crusader by this point the awk had about 700 tanks comprising crusaders matildas and the american lent least tank the steward rommel had just 390 tanks mainly comprising panzer 3s and panzer 4s despite what battlefield 5 might tell you there were no tigers present in 1941. the operation which the awk had placed under the command of lieutenant general alan cunningham commenced on november 18th with a push into solemn and bardia while the british south africans and indians besieged the axis forces there the new zealanders moved north to relief to brooke on the 21st a detachment of british and south african troops were dispatched to attack sidi raziq but were cut off and nearly destroyed when rommel cut between those units in the north and the ones still fighting at salem and bartia the new zealanders did manage to reach cd rezieg by november 25th and make contact with the garrison at brook on the 30th however the units that were supposed to support them were so badly beaten that cunningham urged the awk to let them retreat in response cunningham was fired and replaced with general neil ritchie truth be told the british went through commanders so quickly that my artist couldn't keep up with drawing them so here's a stick figure one of my writers drew the new zealanders now experiencing heavy fighting on all sides were ultimately unable to liberate to brook and withdrew back to egypt on december 1st however as rommel was never able to take to brooke he could only be resupplied from tripoli and even then only one third of his intended materials survived the royal navy's interdictions once more british forces had been consistently reinforced throughout the year while the german campaign in russia and the balkans diverted any available access manpower away from north africa after a failed attempt to relieve the dangerously isolated italian garrisons at solemn and bardia the axis forces were forced to retreat as they were out of supplies

happened after to brooke was finally liberated well the awk hoped to destroy rommel's remaining forces by cutting them off at beta fam as o'connor and wavel had done with the italians the year before

historian today's video the Battle of Jana before this video starts I'd like to give a quick shout out to history time I highly recommend watching his video on the predecessors of the Ottoman Empire the seljuq turks the link to that video can be found in the description below it is September 11th 1683 and the city of Vienna is on the verge of collapse a massive Ottoman force has surrounded the city and Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa Pasha is poised to succeed where Suleiman the Magnificent failed more than a century and a half ago the Habsburg Emperor Leopold the first has already fled the city and the relief force comprised of bickering elements of the so-called holy League arrives slowly and piecemeal inside the city members of the tiny garrison search desperately for a bomb that could easily spell doom for their defensive efforts the situation is looking desperate and Ottoman victory is a distinct possibility that is unless reinforcements arrive but before all that only about a year and a half earlier the Ottomans and the Holy Roman Empire were at peace at least nominally the internet and warfare between the two powers had come to a lull though nobody expected it to last the Ottomans had a special hatred for the Hapsburgs whom they considered according to Andrew we Croft despicable usurpers falsely using an imperial title that rightfully belonged to the Ottomans the inheritors by conquest of Rome's Imperial past moreover there was a possibility for the Turks to address old grievances and to fulfill long-standing territorial ambitions just over a century and a half earlier Suleiman the Magnificent had been defeated by the Hapsburgs at Vienna and the Ottomans would not rest until this humiliating loss was avenged this and the opportunistic Ottoman commander Kara Mustafa Pasha initiated a protracted infrastructure campaign building the roads and bridges that would allow supply lines to function as smoothly so that an invasion of Austria could be swift and decisive this is something the Ottomans neglected to do in 1529 in their first invasion but why was this time the most opportune moment to strike against the hapsburgs well we can identify three main reasons number one the Austrians economic woes in the wake of the 30 Years War a conflict which wrought not just Austria but most of Europe to the core number two the intensification of Ostrow Ottoman border conflicts in Hungary and number three a zealous Grand Vizier with fantastical aspirations as soon as it became evident that the Ottomans were planning full-scale invasion Emperor Leopold the first and most of his subjects fled Vienna to gather a relief force should the city be subjected to a siege as the Austrians were in no way prepared to face an ottoman onslaught but experience had taught the remaining defenders well and under the inspiring and stalwart Austrian commander count Ernst rüdiger von Sternberg they promptly got to work Manning Vienna's already impressive defenses the city was a massive nearly impregnable fortress shielded by walls almost 200 feet high and equipped with powerful artillery that outclassed the comparatively small field guns that the Ottomans would end up bringing to the fight however it cannot be overstated how methodical the Turkish siege plans were when Kara Mustafa arrived with a force of nearly 150,000 men in the midsummer of 1683 he ordered the raising of any structure immediately outside the city walls and the construction of an extensive network of trenches to shield his men from defensive fire the Viennese defenders were trapped in the city though again the massive Viennese walls prevented the Ottomans from making a Greek but the Grand Vizier had a plan she would direct a detachment of his forces to plant large explosive mines beneath strategic points in the walls although this process had been used successfully by the Turks in Crete it was expensive and time-consuming and the clock was now ticking Emperor Leopold was quickly rallying support from other Christian powers selling the struggle against the Ottomans as a sort of continuation of the Crusades with support from Pope Innocent xi he and his commander of choice Charles of Lorraine formed an alliance with Poland Lithuania Venice and a number of German principalities that would eventually be called the holy League assembling an alliance that large and diverse is no simple matter which is why the holy leagues force of approximately 90,000 men arrived late to the party the German and imperial forces would end up arriving before the heavy polish cavalry who despite their mobility experienced difficulty moving through the densely forested terrain delays like this were highly problematic by September 11th Kara Mustafa had already destroyed and stormed one of the two major defensive points on the wall and the situation for the Austrians was becoming more dire by the minute early the next morning the holy League forces began deploying a top of a large hill outside the city called the column berg with the Imperials on the left the Germans in the middle and a hole in the right flank where the Polish were supposed to be this didn't stop the battle from kicking off early contact was made around four o'clock in the morning and most of the Turkish army was redirected to fight off their relief force the Imperial and German forces were able to form defensive lines with dense musket ranks to repel repeated cavalry charges by the ottomans below using the high ground to their advantage the most elite well-trained portion of the besieging army the 18,000 strong Janissary force was kept in the rear to storm the city when the and defensive point fell in retrospect Karen Mustafa's failure to commit all of the Janissaries to combat the holy league on the column Berg before Polish forces had fully arrived may well have been his fatal mistake at noon the Polish cavalry finally appeared and Kara Mustafa began to realize that something had gone terribly wrong the bomb he had planted in the walls the previous day hadn't exploded like something out of an old black-and-white cartoon it turned out that a contingent of the Viennese garrison had found the device with its fuse still led and then frantically extinguished the flame however the day had not been won for the holy League just yet still possessing a numerical advantage the Ottomans assessed the situation and decided to fight the relief army head-on the members of the holy League recognized almost immediately that the enemy Force had begun to regroup for an all-out attack and so called for a general charge themselves while Ottoman forces were not yet organized Qingyuan the third sobieski had been waiting for this moment of all of Western Europe's military leaders he had the most experience fighting the Ottomans he had suffered a number of terrible defeats at their hands and one just as many great victories and among them this would be his greatest that one he would forever be remembered for at six o'clock p.m. yon rallied the three thousand polish winged hussars along with the holy leagues fifteen thousand other mounted troops minutes later eighteen thousand men came crashing down the column smashing the Ottoman line the noise was deafening dirt rolling behind these surging troops like a storm on the ground it was the single largest cavalry charge in human history and Kara Mustafa Pasha's forces crumbled before it so BS Keys charge was the most decisive moment of the battle which resulted in the siege being lifted within a few short hours the Turkish war effort did not recover and the holy League would go on to recapture much of Hungary the battle marked the end of the Ottoman incursions into Western Europe and the

Despite French calls for support during the 1940s and 50s the United States ultimately decided not to send troops to Vietnam by 1954 friends had completely pulled out of Indochina after seven long years of bloodshed splitting the area between Communists aligned North Vietnam and an Unpopular and generally corrupt Western aligned South Vietnam, but peace wouldn't last long in 1955 fighting continued but this time between north and south President Kennedy, like Eisenhower was hesitant to put boots on the ground in Vietnam after the humiliating defeat of France But after Kennedy's assassination in 1963 vice president, lyndon, b johnson seeing communism threatened the status quo in asia once more ramped up US involvement after the late summer of 1964 when it was claimed that two US ships that were aiding the South Vietnamese military Came under attack by communist forces in the Gulf of Tonkin Congress soon gave President Johnson the authority to send US troops and by early 1965 thousands were deployed now that we know why exactly America found itself in Vietnam, let's find out how it all went wrong The American soldiers in Vietnam were fighting two enemies whose battle tactics were well honed through years of combat against the French and Japanese the first were southern Insurgents called the Vietcong and the second were the more organized North Vietnamese Army were NVA The NVA was well supplied by the Soviet Union and China and fought with aggressive guerrilla tactics that the US was in most ways for Us general william Westmoreland led the American army in Vietnam and waged a strictly attrition based defensive war Westmoreland was known to have let politics dictate his decision-making process as policymakers in Washington Instead wanted statistics and numbers to show that they were winning Success was measured by body counts but counter-intuitively the more bombs that were dropped and the more people that were killed the more support the North Vietnamese gained The US was attempting to wage a conventional war as they did in Korea But the non-uniformed Vietcong were highly mobile and unidentifiable avoiding direct Confrontations whenever they could relying on ambushes booby traps and similar tactics to grind at US morale The result of this strategy was that there were no actual front lines while the Vietcong frustrated US troops in the south the NVA commander roll wings off also knew that a conventional war was Impossible to win and focused on winning over the people through an extensive propaganda network He is quoted saying do not fear the enemy for they can only take your life Fear the media far more for they will destroy your honor the Americans meanwhile believed that their attrition strategy Was successful and Westmoreland was predicting an imminent end of world But unbeknownst to him Vietnamese forces were effectively using the Ho Chi Minh Trail to move large amounts of supplies through neutral Laos Despite being bombed almost every hour By 1968 the US illusion of imminent victory was shattered by the Tet Offensive the Google campaign saw over 80,000 NBA and Vietcong troops attacked more than 800 cities throughout the country Including the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon much of the fighting such as in Wei became the war's bloodiest battles Despite launching such an ambitious attack the NVA made few if any tangible gains But it struck a devastating blow to American morale not only back in the United States But also in the field at home the leaking of the Pentagon Papers Also dispelled any justifications for the war and revealed atrocities such as the My Lai massacre Further increasing an anti-war sentiment across the country and a so-called credibility gap began to grow between what the public was told and what they believed as William, Westmoreland himself would later say it's the first war we've ever fought on the television screen and the first war that our country ever fought where the media had full rein the casualties suffered in the war were now seen in a new light with so many men having been lost thus far on the other side of the world and they Weren't even

       " ' Before we start, I want to thank NordVPN for sponsoring this video. Hi, I\\'m Griffin Johnson, the Armchair Historian. Today\\'s video: the War of the Spanish Succession. Coming up: pretender claimants, complex geopolitics, and some really funny looking Hapsburg jaws. Europe\\'s long and complex history is marked by many wars sparked by territorial, religious, and colonial disputes to name a few. But it was fear of having one country or one dynasty directly governing too much of Europe that lay at the heart of the War of the Spanish Succession. Before we start, I would like to give a shout out to my friend and patreon supporter Derek. He\\'s headed to basic training on the 22nd. So I\\'d like everyone to wish him good luck. Now on to the video. In the year 1665, the Spanish throne passed to the sickly Charles II; a man who made even Frankenstein look attractive. His health problems prompted contemporaries to refer to him as \\'El Hechizado,\\' or \\'The Bewitched.\\' It is traditionally held that Charles II\\'s severe mental and physical impairments were a consequence of inbreeding; something that the Hapsburg Royals did frequently to ensure that wealth and influence remained in the family. Although the Hapsburgs weren\\'t the only ones to partake in such a practice, They are the only royal family to have an inbreeding induced deformity named after them the: Hapsburg Jaw. One of the Hapsburgs\\' infamous disabilities was infertility; and consequently, when the Spanish king, Charles II, died at the age of 38, he still lacked an heir. A coalition of European powers had long been devising plans to divide the Spanish Empire\\'s vast holdings across the continent; and the time had come to put those plans into action. However, there was one obstacle that the coalition had to surmount: Charles II had stated in his will that his kingdom should be left to Philip of Anjou, the grandson of the famed French monarch Louis XIV, also known as the Sun King. Louis followed Charles\\' will and recognized Philip as the new King of Spain. \"Not so fast!\" was the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I\\'s first reply The Emperor refused to recognize Philip of Anjou and instead laid claim to the Spanish throne on behalf of his son, Archduke Karl VI. \"Noble Spaniards, I hereby proclaim that my son, Archduke Karl VI of Austria will be your rightful sovereign and ruler of the Spanish Empire. He shall henceforth be called \\'Carlos.\\'\" \"¿Qué? (What?)\" The Spanish people were not fans of this new Austrian pretender and a momentous clash was brewing. On one side stood France and Spain, aided by Portugal, Hungary, Savoy, and a handful of German principalities; and on the other, stood the Grand Alliance comprised of England, Scotland, the Dutch Republic, Austria, Prussia, and Hanover. It wasn\\'t long before the two alliances prepared for war. From the onset of the war of the Spanish Succession, coalition forces were on the offensive. In 1703, a decisive naval victory at Vigo Bay was one, which prompted Portugal to flip sides that same year opening a new front in Iberia. around the same time Savoy also flipped sides, further pressuring French and Spanish Holdings in Italy. Between 1704 and 1708, this trend of aggression continued, as the Alliance won victory after victory in Central Europe. The military prowess of John Churchill, whose victory at Blenheim, forced Bavaria out of the war, and Prince Eugene of Savoy allowed coalition forces to fully contain France. These victories even included two brief occupations of Madrid and successful occupations of Barcelona and Valencia. But Philip of Anjou remained firmly seated on the throne, in part as a result of his popularity with the Spanish people. \"¿Qué?\" But massive war expenditures gradually took a toll on the Spanish and French treasuries. By 1708, both sides were in a deadlock. The French were completely forced out of northern Italy; and Spain, out of southern Italy. the British Royal Navy also enjoyed naval supremacy in the Mediterranean, even seizing Spanish Gibraltar and Menorca. But France itself remained relatively untouched and no lasting breakthroughs were made in Spain. Most of the participating countries wanted the war to come to a close, but France wouldn\\'t budge. Louis\\' decision to continue fighting paid off. Why? Because in 1705, the Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I, died, passing the throne to his eldest son, Joseph, who then also died in 1711. This meant that Archduke Karl VI was now Holy Roman Emperor, the man the Grand Alliance was fighting to place on the Spanish throne. This, needless to say, complicated things, as no one in Europe wanted to see Karl VI accumulate so much power at the head of both the Holy Roman and the Spanish empires. An important thing to remember is that the grand alliance was attempting to establish a balance of power on the continent, so that no dynasty had too much control. However, with no figurehead to rally behind, the Grand Alliance soon collapsed, allowing the French to negotiate for more favorable terms, but they still needed to make concessions. Philip of Anjou remained on the Spanish throne, but several measures were taken to limit French power, including the transfer of territories and trade privileges to the Allies (Grand Alliance). Among the territories were parts of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Hudson Bay, St. Kitts Gibraltar, and Menorca, all ceded to the British. The war empowered the British in other ways as well. By the time it ended, Britain had the largest navy in the world. Additionally, the war significantly weakened the Dutch, who had been one of, if not, the greatest obstacle to British mercantile supremacy. Austria, meanwhile, did gain parts of the Netherlands, and was able to secure its hold over Italy and Hungary. During that same century British and Austrian preeminence in Europe would be challenged in the War of the Austrian Succession, just a couple decades later. Meanwhile, the losses suffered by the severely overextended French state marked the beginning of the end of French hegemony in Central Europe for nearly a century. But they would return to the region as a transformed state not under a king, but an emperor. Now on to our sponsor, NordVPN. Many people neglect their online privacy.

He writes this of the conflict Japan's major goal was the possession of Korea and Manchuria The vast landmass is just across the sea that were stepping stones towards the even larger prize, which was China This defeat prompted cries for reform and after a series of failed revolts including the 1899 Boxer Rebellion the Qing government found itself in an even more precarious position by 1911 the government was fully overthrown in what was called the Wu Chun Revolution the leaders of this revolution selected the exiled Intellectual Sun yat-sen to be China's first president in 1912 However, their territories were limited to southern China Meanwhile, the boy Emperor Puyi remained in power in the north. He was backed by General Yuan Shikai Who had the largest army in the region and therefore pretty much called the shots? Thus soon yot sent one XI Chi over to his side without bloodshed by offering him the presidency From there things didn't exactly go as planned. You want imposed a military dictatorship and egg Sun yat-sen after he formed the opposing Kuomintang or KMT in 1916 yuan proclaimed himself emperor of China pretty much missing the point of the rebellion in Ireland He quickly lost much of his support and after his death China was once again balkanized in two regions under the control of local Warlords after yuan died soon yat-sen returned to China and at the helm of the nationalist Kuomintang party was able to take power and impose yet another military government in 1921 shortly after in 1923 They sealed cooperation with the Communist Party of China or CPC in exchange for assistance in ending regionalism The CPC had been founded in the wake of the may 4th movement which involved a series of student protests formed in opposition to the Chinese government's Ineffective response to the Treaty of Versailles, which transferred what was formerly Chinese own land to the Japanese The may 4th movement popularized Marxism as a radical alternative to the Kuomintang really the only reason the CPC aligned itself with the KMT was so it could spread communism as it liberated each warlord state with the assistance of the much stronger KMT in 1925 soon yat-sen died leaving China in the hands of Chiang kai-shek who two years later initiated what was known as the white terror in response to a communist plot to overthrow him this resulted in the deaths of Thousands of members of the CPC in the aftermath communist leaders lead Lee Sung and Mao Zedong Began waging a guerrilla war against the Kuomintang While this was happening the soviet union who saw the CPC as their communist allies Directed it to take a more aggressive stance Against the Kuomintang as a result Lee Lisan ordered an offensive to be carried out against the Nationalists It was a disaster and led to his replacement by a group of Chinese intellectuals called d28 Bolsheviks with warlords still in control of numerous regions and the two major political factions of China in all-out war the Situation was looking worse than ever Seeing the turmoil unfold the shadow of Japan once again loomed over China in 1931 they sent roughly 45,000 men to occupy Chinese Manchuria with no troops to spare the Kuomintang was forced to concede without resistance Chiang now understood that he needed to defeat the CPC before China was fully invaded to this end Chang assembled the largest Kuomintang army yet And in 1934 encircled Mao's guerrilla forces stationed in the mountains The climax of this episode was the long march which began when the CPC devised a near Suicidal plan to break through Shang's encirclement and march over 6,000 miles to regroup in the north About half of the CPC's forces were lost when crossing the Xiong river a decision which the 28 Bolsheviks shouldered Responsibility for in the wake of this debacle mount took control of the Communists By the time the remnants of the CPC reached their northern destination only 10 percent of them were still alive Prompting now to launch a massive recruitment effort Recognizing that if the Japanese invaded both day and the Kuomintang would be destroyed Mao sought to form yet another United Front Shang was vehemently opposed to the offer but his generals weren't they took matters into their own hands taking Shang hostage and pressuring him to accept Mao's offer Chiang eventually decided to accept and formed what was called the second United Front in 1937 when Japan did invade that year the Kuomintang proved unable to fully repulse the invaders something which worried the Chinese people and now capitalized on this discontent to recruit even more men to his cause Furthermore his forces did not engage those of Japan very frequently allowing the Kuomintang to bear the of the Japanese onslaught After Japan surrendered to the Allies in 1945 The Kuomintang and CPC ended the second United Front It only took one year for the Chinese Civil War to rage on yet again the CPC was

       " ' This video is sponsored by \"Brilliant\"; more on that later. Hi, I\\'m Griffin Johnson, the Armchair Historian. Today\\'s video: What was life like in Nazi Germany? When one tries to imagine what life was like for the average German between the years of 1933 and 1945, what comes to mind? Many would likely envision it as a drab nightmarish totalitarian dystopia, and in many ways this was true, certainly for the sections of society that the Nazi\\'s firmly repressed, but how much different was life like for the Germans who lived up to Hitler standards? Before we address the life of the average citizen, we must first understand what life was like for minorities, and as can be imagined the rights of these groups were essentially eliminated, almost as soon as Hitler took power in 1933. Jewish civil servants such as teachers, professors, engineers, and administrators were excluded from government employment within the first few months of Hitler\\'s election. The Nazis used their newly acquired power to orchestrate what would be known as \"Kristallnacht\" or \"Crystal Night\" in which thousands of Jewish businesses, homes, and synagogues were burned or otherwise vandalized, their owners beaten and arrested. By 1941 almost all of Germany\\'s remaining Jewish population, which 10 years earlier had numbered over half a million, were imprisoned in concentration camps. The Nazis embarked on an ideologically-fueled campaign against virtually all minorities and marginal groups of society including gypsies, homosexuals, Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, and ethnic Slavs. One of the methods used in this campaign was forced sterilization. In the words of Richard Evans in his book \"The Third Reich in Power\" \"In essence the Nazi regime was using Sterilization to crush those areas of society that did not conform to the Nazi ideal.\" Another particular aspect of this campaign that has been written about repeatedly, is the Nazis eugenics program which sought to systematically breed out those the Nazis deemed \"untermenschen\" or subhuman. For example, state-appointed physicians were authorized and instructed to euthanize children that were considered, by the Nazis, to be unworthy of life. Up to one-hundred thousand Germans including twenty-thousand children were euthanized between 1939 and 1941. Now that we understand the experiences of those the Nazis persecuted, let\\'s examine how life was for everyday citizens. While the role of men in society under the new regime was not much different from that of the previous, one women experienced a variety of new expectations the Nazis introduced what they saw as traditional German values for women, which included modesty, dedication to Christian (in this case Nazified) values, and most importantly the production of children, which the Nazis viewed as a crucial component of their plans to expand the German nation. In fact, a civil award: a German Mother\\'s Cross, was established and given to women who bore at least four children. In schools, students were taught a curriculum that was designed to encourage discrimination and discourage racial mixing. To quote Richard Evans again: \"Teachers and pupils greet each other at the beginning and end of every lesson with the Nazi salute.\" The pupils listen to major political speeches on the radio in the school hall.\" As we mentioned, the primary objective of the Nazi school system was to ensure that the party\\'s ideology became ingrained in the minds of students, something which was intended to produce loyal soldiers for future wars. Dating all the way back from 1922, the Hitler Youth and later on its female branch, the League of German Girls, was meant to prepare boys for military service and girls for motherhood. These organizations were incredibly popular in Germany and by 1939, over 90 percent of Germany\\'s children were part of the Hitler Youth. During this time, even more innocuous institutions of German society began to take a National Socialists slant, as can be seen with the positive Christianity movement, which was a state-sponsored program to unite all of Germany\\'s Protestant churches into one national church that would legitimize and support the Nazi agenda. Government, under the direction of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, distributed millions of inexpensive radios to the people in order to make sure that important political messages could reach them. These measures, however, often did not produce the desired effect, as most people were only interested in carrying on daily life as it had existed before. Recognizing that most of the German people could not be fully indoctrinated, the government enforced its ideal German state through legislation. For example, it was required for both men and women aged 19 to 25 to commit a six-month tour of public labor, in which they fulfilled the Nazi concept of a social labor force. Women were then allowed to return home, but men were conscripted into the Wehrmacht or German military. This provided a steady source of manpower for the ultra-militaristic Nazi state. The Nazis also introduced the \"Volkswagen\" or \"People\\'s car\", which was intended to provide each German  household with a vehicle, as part of Hitler\\'s campaign to motorize Germany. In regards to economics, the Great Depression was taking a disastrous toll on the German people before the Nazis were elected. By 1933, unemployment stood at 35 percent and inflation was rampant. Naturally, the Nazis promised to improve the state of the German economy, something which earned them many votes in the election of 1933. Their first priority was to reduce the dismal amount of unemployment in Germany by initiating large public works projects such as the construction of canals and the \"Autobahn\" or \"Highway\". Hitler boasted his success in spite of the fact that many of the employment statistics that were used excluded significant portions of the population such as Jews and soldiers. Though the Nazis economic reforms have generally been considered effective, it took years for the unemployment rate to actually drop to stable levels. Despite promising peace, both during and after his election, Hitler would once again involve the German people in a large-scale war. As the need for resources to power the German military grew larger and larger, more countries were subjected to Hitler\\'s conquest, something which escalated the war onto a global scale. As the conflict raged on, it quickly became apparent to most observers, even those within Germany, that the idealistic utopia that the Nazis hoped for would never come to fruition. The sheer number of casualties that the war produced, especially on the Eastern Front was overwhelming. When defeat finally did arrive, it would take nearly a half-century before life would return to normal, as the country was divided between the Democratic West and the Communist East, until they were reunited in 1990. One of the scientists who fled Germany in the 1930\\'s was none other than Albert Einstein. Our sponsor for today, \"Brilliant\", allows you to master the kind of problem-solving and logic that would have been familiar to Einstein himself. Jumping into science, math, and physics sounds like an extremely daunting task, especially for an armchair historian like yourself, but \"Brilliant\" allows you to learn these concepts through fun bite-sized problems. In all of \"Brilliant\\'s\" lessons they\\'re both visuals and thorough explanations. If you\\'re currently a student or just a lifelong learner, we highly recommend you start your free trial at \"brilliant.org/armchairhistorian\". The first seventy-six users, the amount of years that Einstein was around, will get twenty percent off of their first annual subscription. So, please support our channel by signing up today. Thanks for watching! I\\'d like to thank the Armchair Historian team and my general staff on Patreon. If you\\'re interested in German history, check out our videos on the rise of Prussia and the Prussian army. We\\'ll see you next time next Friday with our video on communist China.']"
